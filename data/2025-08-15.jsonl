Most DIA algorithms\ninvolve matching the spatially-varying PSF shape between science and template\nimages, and then convolving that shape in one image to match the other. The\nwrong choice of which image to convolve can introduce one of the largest\nsources of artifacts in the final difference image. We introduce a quantitative\nmetric to determine the optimal convolution direction that depends not only on\nthe sharpness of the images measured by their FWHM, but also on their exposure\ndepths. With this metric, the optimal convolution direction can be determined a\npriori, depending only on the FWHM and depth of the images. This not only\nsimplifies the process, but also makes it more robust and less prone to\ncreating sub-optimal difference images due to the wrong choice of the\nconvolution direction.

Changes to the detectors' gain characteristics over\ntime will result in a non-linear stretching of the entire energy range.\nMoreover, observations from past MeV telescopes and proton-beam experiments\nhave shown that radiation damage in space causes photopeak shifts and spectral\nline broadening. These necessitate a plan for regular, in-orbit calibration. In\nthis study, we demonstrate a method to monitor and recalibrate the COSI\ndetectors using background line emissions produced by the space radiation\nenvironment. We employ Monte Carlo simulations of particle background and show\nthat strong background lines arise from nuclear excitation of COSI's detectors\n(germanium) and cryostat (aluminum) materials.

We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the\nspherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity.

We then\nmodel the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk\nusing the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based\non the observed jet precession of M87*.
