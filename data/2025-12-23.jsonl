Dhieux Lestavel"], "title": "Toward an usage of americium-241 for filter calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "In nuclear safety and environmental studies, it is necessary to measure the activity of aerosols collected on filters. The calibration of these filters' measurement chains currently involves producing a reference filter with a controlled deposit of aerosol marked by a specific radionuclide. In France, commonly used radionuclides include 137 Cs for gamma or beta emitters, 90 Sr/ 90 Y for beta emitters, and 239 Pu for alpha emitters. However, using 239 Pu presents several issues, notably the destruction of the filter required to determine its traceable activity and the associated uncertainties. The challenge of this project is to propose a radionuclide enabling non-destructive, SI-traceable measurement while retaining the reference filter. The proposed radionuclide is 241 Am, which is both alpha and gamma-emitting and allows for precise non-destructive measurements. Reference filters are produced on the IRSN's ICARE test bench with calibrated aerosols tagged with 241 Am. The reference activity of theses filters is measured by gamma spectrometry on CEA/LNHB reference counter. A series of tests confirmed that 241 Am provides accurate activity determination with minimal uncertainty. Consequently, adopting 241 Am can significantly improve the reliability of radioactive contamination monitoring while avoiding practical challenges associated with plutonium."}

Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration."}

To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.\n  This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.\n  Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications."}

Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen."}

A large subset of these transient noise artifacts, termed as ``glitches'' for short, trigger BBH search templates. Some of them go on to produce detection candidates and require human vetting, supported by data quality tools, to be correctly identified and vetoed. In its current version, CoBiTS takes as inputs single-detector strain timeseries snippets, claimed by other search pipelines to be containing GW candidates, and outputs the significance of each snippet to contain a BBH signal and a glitch. CoBiTS is shown to be particularly effective in discriminating high-mass BBH signals from blips and scattered light glitches, even when a signal is near concurrent or overlapping with a glitch. The performance of CoBiTS gains from employing Conformer, which is a specialized model that combines convolutional layers and Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks.

It is known that exciting massive fields with the Unruh thermal bath is heavily suppressed when the field's rest energy is much larger than the acceleration energy scale, $Mc^2 \\gg\\hbar a/c$. However, the standard literature lacks an explicit quantitative derivation of this suppression. In this work, we first fill this gap by deriving the exponential suppression, $\\sim \\exp(-\\text{constant}\\times Mc^2/(\\hbar a/c))$, in two different frameworks: a (3+1)-dimensional Unruh-DeWitt detector and a (1+1)-dimensional cavity QED setup. This shows the suppression is universal and sets an insurmountable barrier for any detection method that relies on exciting massive fields. For an electron-mass field at achievable accelerations ($a \\sim 10^{20}$ m/s$^2$), the suppression exceeds $10^9$ orders of magnitude. To avoid this suppression, the field's rest energy must be less than or of the order of the acceleration energy scale, $M c^2 \\lesssim \\hbar a / c$. Achieving this condition, however, requires astronomically high accelerations. For example, detecting the effect for an electron-mass field would require accelerations of $a \\gtrsim 4.6\\times 10^{29}$ m/s$^2$, which is far beyond experimental reach. While using a massless field avoids this suppression, we show the best strategy is not to avoid mass, but to engineer a small effective mass that satisfies the optimal condition $\\hbar a / c \\gg M_{\\text{eff}} c^2$. We propose a concrete implementation using a superconducting circuit with a Josephson persistent-current qubit (the analog of a UDW detector) coupled to a microwave resonator (the analog of the scalar field). For this system, the optimal condition is $2I_pΔΦ\\gg Δ$, where $I_p$ is the persistent current, $ΔΦ$ is the magnetic flux swing, and $Δ$ is the qubit's tunneling energy gap...."}

Until now, most studies have relied on single-spacecraft measurements, which could not simultaneously capture upstream solar wind conditions and the induced magnetic fields, thereby limiting our understanding of the system. Here, we statistically re-examine the properties of Mars' induced magnetic field by incorporating, for the first time, real-time upstream solar wind conditions from the coordinated MAVEN and Tianwen-1 observations. Our results are show that both solar wind dynamic pressure and the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) magnitude enhance the strength of the induced magnetic field, but they exert opposite effects on the compression ratio: higher dynamic pressure strengthens compression, while stronger IMF weakens it. The induced field is stronger under quasi-perpendicular IMF conditions compared with quasi-parallel IMF, reflecting a stronger mass-loading effect. We further investigate the clock angle departures of the induced fields. They remain relatively small in the magnetosheath near the bow shock, increase gradually toward the induced magnetosphere, and become significantly larger within the induced magnetosphere. In addition, clock angle departures are strongly enhanced under quasi-parallel IMF conditions. Their dependence on upstream drivers further shows that, within the magnetosheath, clock angle departures are minimized under low dynamic pressure, high IMF magnitude, and low Alfven Mach number conditions. These results may enhance our understanding of solar wind interaction with Mars, and highlight the critical role of multi-point observations."}

Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution."}

We search both for seconds-scale burst-like emission, primarily from fundamental (f-)mode oscillations, and for longer quasi-monochromatic transients up to four months in duration, primarily from quasi-static quadrupolar deformations. We find no significant detection candidates, but for the first time we set direct observational upper limits on gravitational strain amplitude that are stricter than what can be indirectly inferred from the overall glitch energy scale.

We refer to SAWs as energetically-dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma incompressibility, and magnetic incompressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, AW modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the time scale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks (SBs) and SAWs (for a 1-hour long time scale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as SBs. For a sample of 1636 1-hour SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than one hour.

Small signal modeling and analysis were used to determine parasitic/transit delays, and gate-resistance thermometry was implemented to thermally characterize AlGaN PolFET and benchmark against state-of-the-art AlGaN HEMTs. The ultra-thin AlGaN PolFET showed thermal resistance of 12 K.mm/W, representing a significant reduction from typical AlGaN transistors. These results show state-of-art combination of high current density, excellent fT-LG product for ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN transistors, and superior thermal performance, and highlight the promise of AlGaN transistors for future RF and mm-wave applications."}

Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern."}

Such techniques require detailed knowledge of the spectral instrumental profile in order to produce accurate results. We present a method to characterize the spatial variation of parameters of dual-etalon FPI instruments mounted in telecentric configuration: spatially-resolved cavity separation and reflectivities of both etalons, and the prefilter variation across the field-of-view. We aim at characterizing the field-of-view dependence of the parameters of the new CRISP2 FPI. We have implemented a forward model of the FPI instrumental degradation combined with a template average quiet-Sun spectra at disk center in order to model two sets of observational data. Our method does not require any change in the optical setup or the utilization of external sources of illumination. We assess the validity of several functional forms in the calculation of the FPI transmission profiles. Our results show that (generally) the inclusion of the secondary transmission peaks at 1 times the Free Spectral Range and a detailed estimate of the prefilter curve is necessary to obtain accurate values of both etalon reflectivities. For narrow prefilters (relative to the FSR), the former requirement can be relaxed. Our results show that the cavity separation of CRISP2 is very flat, showing an RMS variation below 1.9 nm over the entire field-of-view for both etalons. Reflectivity RMS variations are 0.4% and 0.3% for the primary and secondary etalons at 617.3 nm. We have assessed data and modeling requirements in order to derive accurate FPI parameters and minimize errors in the determination of etalon reflectivities."}

Lett. B, in press", "summary": "The conception of gravity as an emergent phenomenon, rooted in the thermodynamics of spacetime, offers a radical departure from its geometric description. This paper investigates the emergence of cosmic space by synthesizing two key thermodynamic approaches: the equilibrium perspective, where the first law of thermodynamics is applied to the apparent horizon, and the dynamic perspective of Padmanabhan, where the cosmic space emerges as cosmic time progresses. The central element of our study is the incorporation of a mass-to-horizon entropy relation, $M=γ{c^2 L^n}/{G}$, where $M$ denotes the effective mass associated with the system, $L$ corresponds to the cosmological horizon, and $γ$ is a constant with dimensions $[L]^{1-n}$. We first use this relation within the Clausius relation and apply the first law of thermodynamics, $dE=T_h dS_h+WdV$, on the apparent horizon to derive the modified Friedmann equations. Subsequently, we embed the mass-to-horizon entropy relation into Padmanabhan's cosmic emergence proposal, the dependence of the volume change on the degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary, and show its consistency with the thermodynamically derived equations. The successful reconstruction of the modified Friedmann equations through these independent yet convergent thermodynamic routes strongly suggests that the mass-to-horizon entropy is a fundamental bridge between the information-theoretic microstructure of spacetime and its effective cosmological description. Finally, we show that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled for the universe enveloped by the apparent horizon."}

In AFM, the tip or sample is typically scanned using piezoelectric scanners, which convert applied voltages into precise mechanical displacements with sub-nanometer accuracy and high bandwidth. However, because piezo elements exhibit nonlinear responses, actual displacements can deviate from the applied driving signal by up to 20-30%. Various methods have been developed to improve positional accuracy, but they often suffer from limited scan speed, increased noise, or complex calibration procedures. From the perspective of routine maintenance, ease of calibration is more advantageous for applications where an error of around 1-2% is acceptable, especially when measuring dynamic molecular motions. Motivated by this, we developed a simple method to generate scan waveforms via software-based feedforward control, which can be easily implemented and calibrated. We identify four distinct sources of positioning error in piezo scanners and demonstrate that these errors can be compensated, achieving more than an order-of-magnitude improvement in positioning accuracy compared with uncompensated operation. Because the proposed method requires no additional hardware and is entirely software-based, it does not deteriorate imaging speed and is compatible with a wide range of AFM systems as well as other scanning probe microscopies."}

In this white paper, submitted as part of the ESO Expanding Horizons initiative, we draw on experience from established observatories and emerging collaborations to identify key community-level challenges. We argue that a central and transversal scientific challenge for the 2040s is to operate a flagship observatory in which access to telescope time, data, leadership, training, and career development is equitable across institutions, member states, and beyond.

Using a circulating mass model, we show that hidden momentum arises in uniform fields when an object carries angular momentum. On the quantum side, we analyze the Dirac Hamiltonian in a uniform potential, construct its Foldy--Wouthuysen form, and evaluate the Heisenberg evolution of spin-polarized Gaussian packets. The state used previously, with $\\langle p\\rangle =0$, is not at rest: because canonical and kinetic momenta differ, the packet carries a spin-dependent hidden momentum from $t=0$. Imposing $\\langle x(0)\\rangle =\\langle v(0)\\rangle=0$ requires a compensating spin-dependent $\\langle p(0)\\rangle$; with this preparation $\\langle x(t)\\rangle =0$ to leading order in the gravitational acceleration $g$. Generalizing, an exact Foldy--Wouthuysen transformation (linear in $g$ but to all orders in $1/c$) shows that spin-dependent transverse motion begins no earlier than at $O(g^2)$ for a broad class of wave packets. We conclude that a uniform field does not produce a gravitational spin Hall effect at linear order; the previously reported drift stems from inconsistent initial states and misinterpreting canonical momentum."}

Micro-elastography has recently emerged as a promising tool to estimate cellular viscoelastic properties within a millisecond, without the need for mechanical modeling. Here, we report a fully contactless approach to single-cell micro-elastography, using acoustically oscillating gas microbubbles positioned near individual cells (20~\\textmu m diameter megakaryocytes) as localized shear wave sources. Using this approach, we successfully performed micro-elastography on cells up to five times smaller than those studied in previous works, establishing the smallest single-cell elastography measurements to date. Spherical or non-spherical bubble oscillations generated 15~kHz elastic waves, which we detected using a high-speed camera coupled to a standard bright-field microscope. Noise correlation elastography enabled the measurement of average and local shear-wave velocities within single cells. Our results demonstrate that this method is robust and reproducible across multiple cells from the same cell line, paving the way for real-time, label-free mechanical monitoring of single cells during fast biological processes."}

We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts."}

Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) hosts science-ready data products from over twenty NASA missions, plus community-contributed data collections, and other select surveys.

We have constructed bibliographies for each mission from publications in nearly 40 professional journals, and have identified more than 37,000 refereed articles where investigators made a science usage of data hosted in MAST. The publication rate over the last 50 years shows that most MAST missions have had very high productivity during their in-service lifetimes, and have remained so for years or decades afterward. Annual citations to these publications, a measure of impact on research, are robust for most missions, with citations that grow over more than a decade. Most of the citations come from about 10% of articles within each mission.\n  We examined the bibliographies of the active missions HST and JWST in greater detail. For HST the rate of archival publications exceeded those authored by the original observing teams within a decade of launch, and is now more than 3 times higher. Early indications hint that JWST archival articles could dominate the publication rate even sooner. The production of articles resulting from any given observing program can extend for decades. Programs with small and very large allocations of observing time tend to be particularly productive per unit of observing time. For HST in general, a first publication appears within 1.5 yr for 50% of observing programs, and within 3.8 yr for 80% of programs. We discuss various external factors that affect publication metrics, their strengths and limitations for measuring scientific impact, and the challenges of making meaningful comparisons of publication metrics across missions."}

[1]. Our motivation originates from recent discussions in Refs. [2,3] on whether vacuum purification necessarily entails a prohibitively large (indirect) energy cost, and our goal is to help clarify this issue. We identify the aspects of the mirror trajectory that determine the partners of Hawking quanta, as well as those that govern the energy carried to future null infinity. This allows us to highlight a fundamental disconnection within quantum field theory between the fluxes of quantum information (or purification) and energy. Throughout, we focus on quantities such as local correlation functions and energy fluxes, thereby avoiding reliance on a particle-based interpretation. Finally, we introduce an analytic mirror trajectory that produces Hawking radiation with an adiabatically varying temperature, mimicking the emission from an evaporating black hole. Our analysis identifies constraints on the mirror trajectory under which vacuum purification remains compatible with a prescribed energy budget, and we discuss the lessons that may be drawn from this model for realistic evaporating black holes."}

A narrower locking bandwidth is observed under constant injection power with increasing load reflection. The proper-mismatched system suppresses its sideband energy, thereby reducing phase noise.

Supernovae, Kilonovae, Black-Hole formation, Novae, GRBs, and tidal disruption events are prime examples, as their earliest phases link electromagnetic radiation to gravitational waves, neutrinos, and high-energy emission. Yet, the physics connecting these messengers unfolds within minutes to hours, while traditional surveys revisit the same region of the sky on the scale of days/weeks, missing when the event begins. Current survey facilities excel at answering what happened and how often, but essentially fail in addressing how it happened and how it couples to gravitational waves, neutrinos, or high-energy emission. Continuous wide-area optical monitoring, as proposed here, removes this limitation. The traditional approach, where a GW or neutrino alert triggers electromagnetic follow-up, is now complemented, and sometimes reversed: early electromagnetic discoveries can prompt searches for weaker gravitational waves or neutrino signals that would otherwise be missed. In the Einstein Telescope era, wide-field optical monitoring will allow us to find the optical counterparts of gravitational-wave events and understand their physics. At the same time, a telescope capable of continuous monitoring provides immediate scientific value for planetary defense, space-debris tracking, stellar variability, exoplanets transit monitoring, accretion-driven activity, and when we step into a new observational territory, the true discoveries are often the ones we did not expect. In this vision, continuous time-domain astronomy does not replace classical surveys: it completes them by supplying the missing temporal dimension. Follow-up observations remain essential, but they now begin at the physical onset of the event rather than after its evolution is underway."}

While effective at describing \\textit{what} elite players do, these approaches often fail to explain \\textit{why} such motions are physically necessary from a mechanistic perspective. This paper proposes a deterministic, physics-based approach to the tennis serve using a 12-degree-of-freedom multi-segment model of the human upper body. Rather than fitting the model to motion capture data, we solve the inverse kinematics problem via trajectory optimization to rigorously satisfy the aerodynamic boundary conditions required for Flat, Slice, and Kick serves. We subsequently perform an inverse dynamics analysis based on the Principle of Virtual Power to compute the net joint torques. The simulation results reveal that while the kinematic trajectories for different serves may share visual similarities, the underlying kinetic profiles differ drastically. A critical finding is that joints exhibiting minimal angular displacement (kinematically ``quiet'' phases), particularly at the wrist, require substantial and highly time-varying torques to counteract gravitational loading and dynamic coupling effects. By elucidating the dissociation between visible kinematics and internal kinetics, this study provides a first-principles framework for understanding the mechanics of the tennis serve, moving beyond simple imitation of elite techniques."}

Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $α$~Cen~B, GJ~581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator.

The logarithmic dependence between the scalar field evolution and the number of e-folds is investigated as the example. The derived model was found to obey a quadratic law between the parameters of cosmological perturbations. On the basis of suggested approach, a new cosmological inflation model with an exponential potential is proposed. This complies with existing observational constraints for both background and perturbation spectrum parameters. A comparison of obtained results with the solutions obtained by the symbol regression is made. The restrictions for arbitrary parameters in the model with logarithmic potential are also considered.

In the present work we investigate, through molecular dynamics simulations, the morphologies and self-diffusion coefficient of water channels that are nanoconfined in the void space between adjacent surfaces of nanotube bundles - an existing class of materials. In our simulations, we begin with water filling completely the void space, and then we progressively increase the inter-surface separation, maintaining the water content. We find that, as the inter-surface separation progresses, the dimensionality of the water channel decreases from 2D to 1D, the latter consisting of self-confined water channels along surface grooves. The morphologies and self-diffusion coefficients of these 1D water nanochannels are strongly dependent on the nature of the water-surface interaction and on the diameter of the nanotubes. Interestingly, as we decrease the nanotube diameter from 10 to 5 nm, the self-diffusion coefficients of the 1D channels increase by tenfold for hydrophilic surfaces and by sixfold for hydrophobic surfaces, surpassing, in both cases, the bulk water values. We also investigated the water channels at the interstitial voids of the bulk bundle material, finding 1D water channels that are similar to the surface ones."}

Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\\rm E} \\gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \\sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $Λ$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited."}

The influence of the black hole parameters on the horizon structure, thermodynamic stability, and geometric deformation of spacetime is systematically investigated. Explicit expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity are derived, revealing the formation of black hole remnants and extended stability phases induced by Lorentz symmetry-violating (LSV) effects. The sparsity of Hawking radiation is quantified, showing that Lorentz violation suppresses the continuum limit and produces a more discrete, less thermal emission spectrum. A detailed analysis of null geodesics is performed to determine the photon region and shadow morphology, indicating that increasing l and Q compresses and distorts the shadow boundary, while rotation diminishes its overall size. The ergosphere geometry is analyzed in detail, showing that increases in a, l, and Q not only enlarge and distort the ergoregion but also intensify frame-dragging, thereby maximizing the efficiency of energy extraction via the Penrose process. These results reveal clear and potentially observable deviations from standard Kerr-Newman-AdS predictions, providing a powerful new avenue to probe Lorentz symmetry breaking and test the fundamental structure of gravity in extreme strong field regimes."}

Here, we study the effect of thermal conduction from a joule-heated wire to a surrounding gas on pressure-dependent 3$ω$ measurements, and show how a one-dimensional (1D) heat-transfer model may be used to reliably determine the wire's thermal properties. We derive a full analytical solution of the 1D heat-transfer equation with finite heat-transfer coefficient $h$ and validate it experimentally using a 16-$μ$m diameter platinum wire in air across pressures from $10^{-5}$ to $10^3$ mbar. We introduce a model for heat transfer between the wire and the surrounding gas based on kinetic gas theory that accurately describes the data across continuum to free-molecular gas regimes, with $h$ varying from near-zero in high vacuum to approximately 700 W/(m$^2\\cdot$K) at atmospheric pressure. We show that use of a validated $h(p)$ model allows extracting both thermal conductivity $κ$ and volumetric heat capacity $ρc_p$, whereas volumetric heat capacity can be extracted even without invoking a specific $h(p)$ model. Our approach facilitates the characterization of fine wires with moderate to low thermal conductivities and may enable accurate thermal measurements of suspended wires with diameters on the nanometer scale."}

We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines.

We demonstrate that this apparent tension reflects a fundamental covariance obstruction: no assignment of classical past variables can simultaneously be covariant under spacetime embeddings, screen off quantum correlations, and reproduce AQFT statistics. This obstruction is distinct from dynamical nonlocality or signalling violations. We formalize this as a no-go theorem in the category-theoretic framework of LCQFT, showing that Bell's notion of local causality -- requiring factorization conditioned on a common past -- is structurally incompatible with diffeomorphism covariance. The failure of Bell locality thus reflects not a breakdown of relativistic causality but the impossibility of embedding quantum correlations into a classical causal framework without introducing preferred foliations or non-covariant beables. This clarifies the conceptual status of nonlocality in relativistic quantum theory."}

The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy.

In the nonrelativistic limit this approach leads to the Schrödinger-Newton equation, which is often assumed to be consistent at least in the weak-field regime. In this work, we reexamine this assumption for spatial quantum superpositions of massive particles. We show that, when the quantum state is properly normalized, no modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential arises at leading order. However, at first post-Newtonian order the semiclassical coupling generically produces state-dependent contributions involving the mass density and the mass current of the superposition. These terms have a parametric scaling which is different from that of the corresponding relativistic corrections and which does not have Planck mass suppression. Our results therefore impose a strong post-Newtonian consistency constraint on deterministic semiclassical gravity, indicating that sourcing the metric solely by expectation values is insufficient to recover a consistent relativistic weak-field expansion."}

Preparing for such experiments, investigations of weak gravitational forces have employed mechanical resonators to detect time-dependent gravitational forces from actuated source masses. Here, we demonstrate a source mass approach which utilizes capacitive actuation of a 1 mg gold sphere embedded on a silicon nitride membrane, rather than piezoelectric or motorized actuation. The design simultaneously provides a method for microwave optomechanical implementation by coupling the membrane position to the electromagnetic mode of a 3D cavity. The cavity quality factor is not significantly compromised by electromagnetic leakage to the actuation electrode, allowing DC and kilohertz AC voltages to be introduced in the region where electric fields are strongly concentrated. We measure over 700 nm of driven oscillation amplitude and more than ten percent tunability in the mechanical resonance frequency of the loaded membrane, giving the potential to match the oscillations to the frequency range of a detector in future experiments. An optomechanical readout is demonstrated by measuring the cavity resonance at cryogenic temperatures, while room temperature measurements provide complimentary understanding of the mechanisms which influence the mechanical response, including repulsive contact due to collisions within the device."}

For specific values of parametrization parameters that characterize deviations from general relativity, we find that the real part of asymptotic QNM frequencies diverges in the high-overtone limit, in sharp contrast to the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that the convergence of the real parts of high-overtone QNMs is a distinctive feature of general relativity, while parametrized corrections generically lead to divergent spectral behaviors."}

While the transient vibroacoustic behavior of single-walled shells has been extensively investigated, extending these analyses to double-wall cylindrical configurations introduces increased complexity due to multiple inter-shell acoustic reflections and strong coupling between acoustic fields and structural vibrations. These structures often feature mechanical interconnections between the shells to ensure structural integrity, load sharing, alignment, and enhanced resilience against static and dynamic loads. These links introduce additional pathways for vibration transmission and significantly influence the overall behavior of the system, thus making the analytical description of the coupled vibroacoustic response even more challenging. This study investigates the transient vibroacoustics of an inter-connected double-wall cylindrical shell subjected to an acoustic shock, considering fully coupled fluid-structure interactions. A comprehensive two-dimensional acoustoelastic model is developed in polar coordinates, incorporating the surrounding medium, the fluid occupying the inter-shell gap, and the fluid inside the inner shell. A semi-analytical solution method is employed to capture the time-domain evolution of acoustic fields and shell vibrations. The model's accuracy is verified by benchmarking against available data reported in the literature. Leveraging the passive dynamics of the system, we present a hybrid mechanism that integrates optimized nonlinear vibration absorbers with piezoelectric actuators to control the vibroacoustic behavior. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mechanism in mitigating shock-induced acoustic pressure waves and enhancing the structural resilience of the double-wall cylindrical shell."}

In 1983, Couch and Torrence (CT) found -- surprisingly -- that the massless wave equation continues to display this symmetry on the background of an extremal (and asymptotically flat) black hole, where the inversion interchanges horizon and infinity while preserving the singularity structure of the separated radial mode equation. We revisit this CT inversion symmetry and investigate its possible extensions beyond the extremal (Reissner-Nordström or Kerr) setting in which it was originally identified. Using the example of the static lukewarm de Sitter black hole, we show that neither the exchange of horizon with infinity, nor the preservation of radial singularities, are essential features needed for a CT inversion to exist. Instead, we interpret CT transformations through their action on photon spheres, providing a unified viewpoint that extends to the (phase-space-dependent) CT inversions of the extremal Kerr-Newman geometry. For scalar fields on that spacetime, we find a simple relation between the fixed point of a CT inversion and the coefficient of superradiant scattering. Finally, we exhibit a hidden CT inversion symmetry that arises in the static limit of the Kerr Laplacian for all spins. Together, these results suggest that CT symmetry may admit a broader generalization than previously understood."}

Working in the geometric optics limit of nonlinear electrodynamics, we formulate the two polarization modes as null geodesics of distinct effective (optical) metrics. We then develop a controlled weak-coupling expansion that cleanly separates the standard gravitational deflection from the birefringent contribution induced by the electromagnetic nonlinearity. Using a finite distance Gauss-Bonnet construction on the associated optical manifolds, we derive a general expression for the \\emph{differential} bending angle in which the source and observer are kept at arbitrary radii, thereby extending the usual scattering-at-infinity treatment. As benchmark applications, we specialize our results to the Euler-Heisenberg effective action of QED and to Born-Infeld electrodynamics. We find that the observable birefringence is generically reduced by finite-distance truncation of the curvature flux, and we provide explicit correction series suitable for data analysis. For magnetar-motivated dipolar fields, this geometric effect yields a suppression factor that can diminish the predicted polarization-dependent deflection by as much as $\\sim 50\\%$ for limb emission relative to asymptotic scattering estimates.

Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties."}

As an alternative, modified teleparallel gravity theories such as $f(T)$ gravity offer a purely geometric mechanism to explain cosmic acceleration. In this work, we construct a plane-symmetric anisotropic cosmological model in the framework of exponential $f(T)$ gravity, adopting the functional form $f(T) = T + u e^{-vT}$. A key novelty of this study is that the Hubble function $H(z)$ is derived self-consistently from the field equations rather than being prescribed phenomenologically. Furthermore, we provide the first comprehensive observational test of an anisotropic $f(T)$ model using a combination of DESI, gravitational-wave (GW) data, and complementary datasets including OHD, CMB, and Pantheon+SH0ES. Our best-fit analysis yields $70 \\lesssim H_0 \\lesssim 73~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $0.28 \\lesssim Ω_m \\lesssim 0.34$, and $-0.99 \\lesssim ω\\lesssim -0.69$, all consistent with current late-time cosmological observations. The model accurately reproduces the distance modulus of Type Ia supernovae and the luminosity-distance relation from gravitational-wave standard sirens. These results demonstrate that the proposed anisotropic exponential $f(T)$ model can account for the observed cosmic acceleration without invoking a dark-energy component, thereby offering a novel and observationally consistent framework for studying anisotropic extensions of gravity."}

The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \\texttt{$μ$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models."}

In particular, we show that any static and spherically symmetric spacetime that modifies the Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordström solutions in a perturbative way must have non-zero logarithmic Love numbers. This applies for instance to all regular black hole metrics.

Many such solutions were derived without a specified equation of state or under restrictive or non-physical assumptions, limiting their physical relevance. The aim of this thesis is to study the physical viability of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with extensions to plane and hyperbolic symmetries.\n  The first part reviews the hydrodynamic approach, which interprets a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium. Interpretations as a generic ideal gas, a classical ideal gas, and fluids with transport coefficients are analysed. The framework is extended to the ultrarelativistic Synge gas, and methods to approximate its equation of state are developed.\n  These results are applied to three families of solutions: T-models, geodesic R-models with flat synchronisation, and thermodynamic Stephani universes. For each family, general expressions for the fluid flow, energy density, pressure, speed of sound, and admissible thermodynamic schemes are obtained. Physical viability is assessed using standard energy, positivity, and compressibility conditions, with emphasis on compatibility with a generic ideal gas. In all cases, wide spacetime regions are found where the solutions represent physically admissible perfect fluids.\n  The thesis concludes with xIdeal, a Mathematica package implementing IDEAL algorithms for the analysis of exact solutions, including spacetime characterisations, a metric database, and examples."}

Motivated by this, we investigate shadow formation in spacetimes that lack a photon sphere by applying the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization technique (originally designed to smooth black hole singularities) to null singularity and charged null singularity metrics. Remarkably, these regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can produce a shadow without a photon sphere. We analyze how the SV regularization parameter influences their geometry and shadow size, and show that the regularized null and charged null singularity spacetimes can correspond either to two-way traversable wormholes or retain singularities. Our results reveal that shadows arising from these regularized 'null singularity spacetimes' closely mimic those of Schwarzschild and charged black-bounce spacetimes, despite the absence of a photon sphere.

Using this method, we present the first exact solution which describes a dynamical axisymmetric black (or white) hole embedded in an expanding or contracting cosmology. We provide a detailed investigation of its properties, and in particular its dynamical trapping (or anti-trapping) horizons. To that end, we use the mean curvature vector (MCV) which stands as a natural generalization of the Kodama vector beyond spherical symmetry. The norm of this vector provides a foliation-independent quantity to locate the trapped/anti-trapped and untrapped regions and characterize the causal nature of a given geometry without specific symmetry requirement. The solution-generating method and the techniques to analyze the new solutions provide new powerful tools to further explore the description and the phenomenology of dynamical compact objects embedded in cosmology, in particular those of primordial black holes."}

Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity."}

Fazzari"], "title": "On the Metric $f(R)$ gravity Viability in Accounting for the Binned Supernovae Data", "comment": "44 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to JHEAP", "summary": "In this work, two models of metric $f(R)$ gravity in the Jordan frame are investigated as a dynamical description of the late-time cosmic expansion using binned Type~Ia Supernovae data. The aim is to provide an explanation for the effective running of the Hubble constant observed in both the binned Pantheon Sample and the Master Sample. To this end, the effective running Hubble constant $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ is defined as the ratio between the modified Hubble parameter and that of the standard cosmological model ($Λ$CDM), multiplied by $H_0$. $\\mathcal{H}(z)$ serves as a diagnostic tool to capture deviations from the $Λ$CDM model.\n  The first model used is a general representation of metric $f(R)$ gravity in which the gravitational Lagrangian is encoded in an effective redshift-dependent function that mimics the evolution of the Hubble parameter. Due to the limited redshift range covered by the available Supernovae Data, this function can be reliably approximated by a second-order Taylor expansion.\n  While this more general formulation yields a phenomenological fit that is compatible with that of the $Λ$CDM for the binned Pantheon Sample, the model is not physically viable, as it generically leads to the emergence of an unphysical mass of the scalar field. This issue originates from an implicit restriction imposed on the Cauchy problem for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. To address this limitation, following previous studies, an additional condition on the modified Friedmann equation is introduced, enabling a fully consistent reformulation of the dynamics. The resulting framework not only preserves the agreement with Supernova~Ia data, but also provides a physical justification for the additional condition adopted in earlier analyses of late-time cosmological dynamics."}

Numerical solutions for static, spherically symmetric configurations reveal that a positive Lorentz-violating parameter $\\ell$ suppresses repulsive pressure, thereby enhancing gravitational binding and yielding more compact boson stars. Conversely, a negative $\\ell$ amplifies repulsive pressure and weakens gravitational binding, such that no static solutions exist beyond a critical negative value. These structural modifications imprint distinct features on EMRI dynamics, characterized by a monotonic decrease in both orbital eccentricity and radial range as $\\ell$ increases. Unlike the intermittent bursts from grazing orbits that resemble black-hole signals, penetrating orbits that enter the boson-star core exhibit sustained, amplitude-modulated gravitational-wave signatures without quiet intervals. Their characteristic strain falls within the detectability range of LISA, providing a potential observable for constraining Lorentz violation."}

In order to do that we consider scalar field perturbations non-minimally coupled to a background electromagnetic field. We show that there is compactly supported initial data such that the initial energy flux across the initial Cauchy hypersurface is negative and that the energy flux decreases with time. Then, considering arguments due to J. Friedman and G. Moschidis, this indicates that the energy flux diverges for those solutions and such spacetimes with an ergoregion are unstable."}

A large subset of these transient noise artifacts, termed as ``glitches'' for short, trigger BBH search templates. Some of them go on to produce detection candidates and require human vetting, supported by data quality tools, to be correctly identified and vetoed. In its current version, CoBiTS takes as inputs single-detector strain timeseries snippets, claimed by other search pipelines to be containing GW candidates, and outputs the significance of each snippet to contain a BBH signal and a glitch. CoBiTS is shown to be particularly effective in discriminating high-mass BBH signals from blips and scattered light glitches, even when a signal is near concurrent or overlapping with a glitch. The performance of CoBiTS gains from employing Conformer, which is a specialized model that combines convolutional layers and Transformer architecture for sequence modeling tasks. Conformer is especially good at leveraging the strengths of both convolutional layers -- for local feature extraction -- and self-attention layers -- for capturing long-range dependencies."}

We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts."}
