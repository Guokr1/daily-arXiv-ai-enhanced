Despite\ntheir relatively small size, drones can carry significant payloads, which\nrequire monitoring, especially in cases of unauthorized transportation of\ndangerous goods. A drone's flight dynamics heavily depend on outdoor wind\nconditions and the carry-on weight, which affect the tilt angle of a drone's\nbody and the rotation velocity of the blades. A surveillance radar can capture\nboth effects, provided a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for the received\nechoes and an adjusted postprocessing detection algorithm. Here, we conduct a\nsystematic study to demonstrate that micro-Doppler analysis enables the\ndisentanglement of the impacts of wind and weight on a hovering drone. The\nphysics behind the effect is related to the flight controller, as the way the\ndrone counteracts weight and wind differs. When the payload is balanced, it\nimposes an additional load symmetrically on all four rotors, causing them to\nrotate faster, thereby generating a blade-related micro-Doppler shift at a\nhigher frequency. However, the impact of the wind is different. The wind\nattempts to displace the drone, and to counteract this, the drone tilts to the\nside. As a result, the forward and rear rotors rotate at different velocities\nto maintain the tilt angle of the drone body relative to the airflow direction.\nThis causes the splitting in the micro-Doppler spectra. By performing a set of\nexperiments in a controlled environment, specifically, an anechoic chamber for\nelectromagnetic isolation and a wind tunnel for imposing deterministic wind\nconditions, we demonstrate that both wind and payload details can be extracted\nusing a simple deterministic algorithm based on branching in the micro-Doppler\nspectra."}

In this work, improvements to the efficiency and\nprecision of the TDR are made and two different first guess estimation methods\nare investigated. The combined performance of a machine-learning-based first\nguess and improved TDR is shown to achieve resolutions in the shower arrival\ndirection, depth of shower maximum and shower energy of $\\sim2^\\circ$, $\\sim30$\ng cm$^{-2}$ and $\\sim7\\%$ respectively for simulated events observed from two\nor more locations.

The $1/f$ gain fluctuations of\nsuch a system are expected to be common-mode across frequency channels. If the\ninstrument's system temperature is not constant across channels, a continuum\nsignal will exhibit a frequency dependence different from that of common-mode\ngain fluctuations. Our technique leverages this difference to fit a\nthree-parameter frequency model to each time sample in the time-domain data,\nseparating gain and continuum. We show that this technique can be applied to\nthe COMAP Pathfinder instrument, which exhibits a series of temporally stable\nresonant noise spikes that effectively act as calibrators, breaking the gain\ndegeneracy with continuum signals. Using both simulations and observations of\nJupiter, we explore the effect of a $1/f$ prior for the gain model. We show\nthat the model is capable of cleanly separating Jupiter, a bright continuum\nsource, from the gain fluctuations in the scan. The technique has two\napplications to COMAP.

In this\nstudy, we extend this topological analysis to higher-dimensional, static,\nspherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black holes. By examining the\nasymptotic properties of the vector field associated with the photon spheres,\nwe demonstrate that their topological charge is consistently -1. This result is\na dimensionally independent invariant, guaranteeing the existence of at least\none standard (unstable) photon sphere outside the event horizon. We further\nexplore this conclusion by analyzing two distinct regular black hole solutions\nderived from pure gravity theory, confirming that the topological charge\nremains -1 irrespective of the spacetime dimension. These results provide a\nrobust and universal characterization of photon spheres in higher-dimensional\nspacetimes."}

More generally, it is a consistent way to modify\ngravity from the Hamiltonian perspective. In this framework, the Hamiltonian\n(scalar) constraint is usually the only one to be holonomy corrected. As a\nheuristic hypothesis, we consider the possibility to also correct the\ndiffeomorphism and Gauss constraints. It is shown that it is impossible to\ncorrect the diffeomorphism constraint without correcting the Gauss one, while\nmaintaining a first-class algebra. However, if all constraints are corrected,\nthe algebra can be closed. The resulting differential equations to be fulfilled\nby the corrections (of the background and of the perturbations) are derived."}

Detection prospects of strongly lensed gravitational waves", "comment": "14 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals detected by ground-based\nobservatories will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters. This\nmay produce multiple copies of the signals (i.e., lensed images) arriving at\ndifferent times at the detector. These, if observed, could offer new probes of\nastrophysics and cosmology. However, identification of lensed image pairs among\na large number of unrelated GW events is challenging. Though the number of\nlensed events increases with improved detector sensitivity, the false alarms\nincrease quadratically faster. While this \"lensing or luck\" problem would\nappear to be insurmountable, we show that the expected increase in measurement\nprecision of source parameters will efficiently weed out false alarms. Based on\ncurrent astrophysical models and anticipated sensitivities, we predict that the\nfirst confident detection could occur in the fifth observing run of LIGO,\nVirgo, and KAGRA.

We also tried to make some progress in our previous\nworks, in which we discussed differences between bulk plasma with different\nstreamlines and also defined the covering factor as an internal property of an\naccretion system to quantify its capability on extracting energy via magnetic\nreconnection from its central black hole. In this study, we aim to explore this\ntopic within the framework of a Kerr-Sen-like spacetime induced from Bumblebee\ngravity, which, among various alternative theories of gravity beyond pure\nEinstein gravity, stands out as a promising candidate for explaining certain\nhigh energy astrophysical phenomena. More specifically, we would like to\nanalyze the influence of the rate of Lorentz symmetry breaking and the\nBumblebee charge, the two additional parameters in Bumblebee gravity except for\nthe black hole mass and spin, on the energy extraction via magnetic\nreconnection. By analyzing the allowed regions for energy extraction and the\nvariations of covering factor, we find that energy extraction becomes more\nlikely to succeed and tends to occur closer to the central region when the\nspacetime carries bigger rate of Lorentz symmetry breaking and Bumblebee\ncharge. Furthermore, our results indicate that the most favorable spacetime\nconfiguration for energy extraction via magnetic reconnection, when the\nextractable energy of the central black hole is determined, corresponds to the\nscenario in which the cosmic censorship hypothesis is marginally not violated."}

The key idea is that the vacuum\nstate of gravitons may not be the standard Minkowski vacuum but rather a\nnonclassical state imprinted with the physics of the early Universe, such as\ninflation.
