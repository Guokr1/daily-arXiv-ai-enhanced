### [1] [A pair polarimeter for multi-GeV $γ$-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00022)
*Maxime Defurne,Arthur Muhulet*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型紧凑型对极仪，结合单片有源像素传感器和低密度扩展固体转换器，实现了高效率和高分析能力，为多信使物理学提供了新观测手段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究光子偏振有助于理解其发射或散射机制，揭示环境或被测物体的特性。然而，现有对极仪在GeV能量范围内效率低，主要用于光束表征。

Method: 采用单片有源像素传感器和低密度扩展固体转换器，设计了一种新型紧凑型对极仪。

Result: 该对极仪实现了约7%的高效率和0.2至0.5的本征分析能力。

Conclusion: 这一新概念为多信使物理学提供了新观测手段，可能揭示核子内禀强力和洛伦兹不变性破坏。

Abstract: Accessing the polarization of photon allows to understand the mechanisms
behind its emission or scattering, revealing much about a peculiar environment
or a probed object. For energy above $\sim$10~MeV, the pair production
dominates the photon-matter interaction and the photon polarization is
accessible via the azimuthal angle of the conversion. Unfortunately pair
polarimeters have a low figure-of-merit for multi-GeV photons and are mostly
used for beam characterization. In this paper, we report a new concept of a
compact pair polarimeter associating monolithic active pixel sensors to
low-density extended solid converters to reach simultaneously a high efficiency
of $\sim$7\% and intrinsic analyzing power ranging from 0.2 to 0.5. This new
concept will add a new obersvable to the multi-messenger physics, isolate the
intrinsic strong force in nucleons and possibly reveal violations of Lorentz
invariance.

### [2] [Utilizing Deep Learning for Enhanced Tritium Detection in CCDs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00532)
*E. Rofors,R. Heller,R. J. Cooper,J. Estrada,G. Moroni,B. Nachman,K. Spears*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 氚衰变的低能β粒子检测对核安全、防扩散和环境监测至关重要。

Method: 采用CCD实测数据与Geant4模拟，比较经典方法与CNN、自编码器、BDT等深度学习方法。

Result: CNN在分类性能上表现最优，自编码器展示了无监督方法的潜力。

Conclusion: CCD数据的丰富信息提升了背景抑制能力，为便携式氚监测提供了改进方向。

Abstract: This study explores the use of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) for detecting
low-energy beta particles from tritium decay - a critical signal for nuclear
safety, nuclear nonproliferation, and environmental monitoring. We employ a
dual approach utilizing both measured CCD data and detailed Geant4 simulations.
Our analysis compares classical techniques with advanced deep learning methods,
including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders trained
exclusively on tritium data, and preliminary studies on boosted decision trees
(BDTs). The CNN, trained on mixed signal/background datasets, demonstrates
superior classification performance, while the autoencoder shows the potential
of unsupervised, background-agnostic strategies. These results highlight the
excellent sensitivity achievable thanks to the background rejection made
possible by information-rich CCD data, paving the way for improved portable
tritium monitoring.

Result: 测试台成功测量了各项参数，并分析了1100个MAPMTs的数据分布，同时研究了长期老化效应。

Conclusion: 测试台能有效表征MAPMTs性能，长期老化研究为探测器稳定性提供了参考。

Abstract: Both the future CBM-RICH and the recently upgraded HADES-RICH use Hamamatsu
H12700 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as their photon detectors. To test
the MAPMTs thoroughly before using them in the detectors, the photon sensors
were qualified well in advance and a test bench was built to efficiently
characterize each MAPMT. The test bench measures the single photoelectron gain,
dark rate, relative efficiency, and afterpulse probability of each channel.
This article describes the operating principle of the test bench and discusses
the distributions of each measured quantity over 1,100 MAPMTs. Additionally,
the long-term aging effects of the H12700 MAPMT are investigated based on
repeated measurements of individual MAPMTs.

### [4] [Shaping circuit for improving linearity, bandwidth, and dynamic range in ToT-based detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00739)
*J. Peña-Rodríguez,J. Förtsch,C. Pauly,K. -H. Kampert*

Main category: physics.ins-det

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代高能物理实验中，模数转换器（ADC）的功耗、数据量和带宽限制问题促使寻找替代方案。ToT系统虽简单、低功耗，但存在精度和线性不足的缺点。

Method: 设计了一种整形电路，优化ToT系统的性能，并在CBM实验的RICH探测器读出系统中进行了模拟和实现。

Result: 整形电路有效改善了ToT系统的精度、线性和动态范围，同时保持了其低功耗和带宽优势。

Conclusion: 该整形电路为高能物理实验提供了一种高性能、低功耗的读出解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The quantitative measurement of energy deposits in particle detectors,
particularly in calorimeters, is usually accomplished with the help of
Analog-to-Digital converters (ADCs) due to their precision, wide measurement
range, and good linearity. However, drawbacks such as power consumption, data
volume, and bandwidth limit their use in the next generation of high-energy
physics experiments. Time-over-threshold (ToT) systems offer simplicity, low
power consumption, easy integrability, and wide bandwidth, but they lack
precision, linearity, and dynamic range. In this work, we propose a shaper
circuit that improves the weaknesses of ToT systems without sacrificing
performance. We simulated and implemented the concept in the readout system of
the Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector of the Compressed Baryonic Matter
experiment at FAIR.

### [5] [Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00348)
*Bo Liang,Chang Liu,Hanlin Song,Zhenwei Lyu,Minghui Du,Peng Xu,Ziren Luo,Sensen He,Haohao Gu,Tianyu Zhao,Manjia Liang Yuxiang Xu,Li-e Qiang,Mingming Sun,Wei-Liang Qian*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FM-MCMC的新方法，结合连续归一化流和并行退火MCMC，解决了极端质量比旋进信号参数估计中的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在处理极端质量比旋进信号时，因复杂的似然地形和计算成本高而难以准确估计参数。

Method: FM-MCMC结合连续归一化流（CNFs）和并行退火MCMC（PTMCMC），快速探索高维参数空间并精确采样后验分布。

Result: FM-MCMC显著提高了参数估计的效率和准确性，实现了实时、无偏的参数推断。

Conclusion: FM-MCMC为引力波天文学提供了一种可扩展的高精度分析工具，释放了极端质量比旋进观测的科学潜力。

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals
(EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into
strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex,
non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental
noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local
optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical
bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a
pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows
(CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly
explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior
sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering
EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference,
FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would
serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.

### [6] [Cosmological Reconstructions in Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov Gravity with Torsion and Non-Metricity in the Weitzenböck Geometrical Sector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00026)
*Davood Momeni,Ratbay Myrzakulov*

Main category: gr-qc

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索宇宙加速膨胀、暗能量和暗物质的本质，以及宇宙结构的形成。

Result: ECM模型能够重现观测到的宇宙历史，并提供可测试的预测。

Conclusion: 该模型为理解宇宙演化和基本力提供了新途径，有望革新对引力和宇宙的认知。

Abstract: The universe is a vast and complex system, and our understanding of its
fundamental workings is constantly evolving. In this work, we present a novel
modification to the standard theory of gravity by incorporating curvature,
torsion, non-metricity, and the geometric structure of Weitzenb\"{o}ck
spacetime. This modified framework, referred to as the
Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov (ECM) model, enriched by Weitzenb\"{o}ck geometry,
offers new insights into cosmological phenomena, including the accelerated
expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and the
formation of cosmic structures. Our model not only reproduces observed cosmic
histories but also provides testable predictions that can be compared with
current and future observational data. By addressing some of the most profound
questions in modern cosmology, this work paves the way for a deeper
understanding of the universe's evolution and the fundamental forces that
govern it. The ECM model, extended through Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime, invites
further exploration, offering the potential to revolutionize our conception of
gravity and the cosmos.

### [7] [Effective source for second-order self-force calculations: quasicircular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00087)
*Samuel D. Upton,Barry Wardell,Adam Pound,Niels Warburton,Leor Barack*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文详细介绍了在Schwarzschild背景下计算有效源的方法，用于二阶自引力理论中的后绝热引力波模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，基于二阶引力自力的后绝热引力波模型首次被提出，但有效源的计算尚未详细说明。

Conclusion: 该研究为二阶自引力理论提供了关键的计算工具，推动了后绝热引力波模型的发展。

Abstract: Recent years have seen the first production of "post-adiabatic"
gravitational-waveform models based on second-order gravitational self-force
theory. These models rely on calculations of an effective source in the
perturbative second-order Einstein equation. Here, for the first time, we
detail the calculation of the effective source in a Schwarzschild background,
which underlies the second-order self-force results in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127,
151102 (2021); ibid. 128, 231101 (2022); ibid. 130, 241402 (2023)]. The source
is designed for use in the multiscale form of the Lorenz-gauge Einstein
equation, decomposed in tensor spherical harmonics, or in the analogous
second-order Teukolsky equation. It involves, among other things, contributions
from (i) quadratic coupling of first-order field modes, (ii) the slow evolution
of first-order fields, (iii) quadratic products of a first-order puncture
field, and (iv) the second-order puncture field. We validate each of these
pieces through numerical and analytical tests.

### [8] [Eccentricity signatures in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's BNS and NSBH binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00179)
*Keisi Kacanja,Kanchan Soni,Alexander Harvey Nitz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文研究了低质量双星系统中引力波偏心率的重要性，使用新模型SEOBNRv5EHM分析了六个事件，发现GW200105具有显著偏心率，其他事件则显示低偏心率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分不同形成通道需要测量低质量双星系统的偏心率，但缺乏精确的波形模型和高计算成本是挑战。

Method: 使用SEOBNRv5EHM和TEOBResumS-Dali模型分析数据，优化推断技术，包括高阶模式和并行化。

Result: GW200105的偏心率显著（e≈0.125-0.135），其他事件偏心率低（e≤0.066），GW190814无显著偏心率。

Conclusion: GW200105的偏心率支持偏心假设，其他事件偏心率低，表明不同形成通道的可能性。

Abstract: Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational
waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting
eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate
eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian
inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass
gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four
observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using
the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the
existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity
constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in
both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and
parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible
eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20
Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for
SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides
moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of
$\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on
eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources
are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$
to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in
GW190814.

### [9] [Quantum-Corrected Thermodynamics of Conformal Weyl Gravity Black Holes: GUP Effects and Phase Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00203)
*Erdem Sucu,İzzet Sakallı,Suat Dengiz*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了共形Weyl引力（CWG）中黑洞的热力学性质，重点分析了量子修正对Planck尺度附近的影响，揭示了与Schwarzschild黑洞行为的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索共形Weyl引力中黑洞的热力学性质，特别是量子修正对Planck尺度附近的影响，以提供超越广义相对论的理论框架。

Method: 使用Hamilton-Jacobi隧穿形式导出Hawking温度，结合广义不确定性原理和指数修正熵模型，计算热力学势。

Result: 发现热辐射在近Planck尺度下被抑制，热容量分析揭示了临界相变，共形参数γ对相结构起关键作用。

Conclusion: CWG为研究黑洞热力学提供了超越广义相对论的框架，量子修正揭示了丰富的相结构和潜在观测效应。

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl
Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on
quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis
employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking
temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters
$\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from
Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects
through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic
suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an
exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC
thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity,
and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase
transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the
scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase
structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and
heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG
parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We
also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial
dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing
conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG
offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond
general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures
and potential observational consequences.

### [10] [Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00292)
*Yu Tang,Wentao Liu,Zhilong Liu,Jieci Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子叠加态中的关联提取，重点关注两个Unruh-DeWitt探测器在质量叠加的BTZ黑洞时空中与量子场相互作用时提取的纠缠和互信息。研究发现，时空的叠加性质会引入干涉效应，显著增强纠缠提取。互信息的提取则受探测器间固有距离的影响，并在特定条件下超过单一时空的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子叠加态时空对纠缠和互信息提取的影响，揭示干涉效应在关联提取中的作用。

Method: 使用两个Unruh-DeWitt探测器与量子场相互作用，分析质量叠加的BTZ黑洞时空中纠缠和互信息的提取。

Result: 时空叠加显著增强纠缠提取；互信息在特定条件下超过单一时空结果；关联提取在初始与最终时空状态对齐时达到最大值。

Conclusion: 时空叠加通过干涉效应显著影响关联提取，为量子信息处理提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition,
specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by
two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a
mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the
superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can
significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single
spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information
obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance
between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a
superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the
proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single
spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find
that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima
when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the
initial spacetime state.

### [11] [Quantum entanglement of Hawking-Partner modes in expanding cavities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00423)
*José Manuel Montes-Armenteros,Javier Olmedo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究一维腔中由加速边界产生的量子纠缠，模拟霍金辐射，发现腔膨胀类似挤压装置，霍金-伙伴对行为类似双模压缩态，且低能过程主导纠缠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子纠缠在模拟霍金辐射的加速边界腔中的生成及其特性，验证纠缠是否可被激发及其对初始热噪声的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用对数负性量化量子关联，通过数值模拟分析初始纯态、单模压缩态和双模压缩态，并应用Hotta-Schützhold-Unruh公式重构伙伴模式。

Result: 腔膨胀类似挤压装置，霍金-伙伴对行为类似双模压缩态；低能过程主导纠缠，高能粒子对纠缠贡献小。

Conclusion: 在模拟霍金辐射的系统中，量子纠缠主要由低能过程主导，高能粒子难以纠缠；Hotta-Schützhold-Unruh公式计算高效，但不适用于描述完整系统的多模纠缠结构。

Abstract: This article investigates quantum entanglement generated within a
one-dimensional cavity where one boundary undergoes prescribed acceleration, a
setup designed to mimic aspects of Hawking radiation. We quantify quantum
correlations using logarithmic negativity for bipartitions where subsystem $A$
is a given mode and subsystem $B$ the rest of the system. For initial pure
states, we also consider a given mode and reconstruct its partner using the
Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula, obtaining identical results. Besides the
initial vacuum state, we also consider one-mode squeezed and two-mode squeezed
states, in order to confirm if quantum entanglement can be stimulated.
Moreover, we analyze its robustness against initial thermal noise. Our analysis
is based on numerical simulations and does not assume any approximation beyond
the validity of our numerical algorithms. Our findings reveal that the
expanding cavity effectively acts as a squeezing device, with Hawking-partner
pairs largely behaving as two-mode squeezed states. A significant conclusion is
that, in our setting, purification of Hawking modes is predominantly a
low-energy process, with high-energetic particles contributing negligibly to
the partner modes. Indeed, in both small and large acceleration regimes of the
boundaries, quantum entanglement decreases towards the ultraviolet modes,
indicating that higher-energy particles are more challenging to entangle and
hence less probable to contribute in the purification process. While the
Hotta-Sch\"utzhold-Unruh formula offers notable computational efficiency,
partner modes do not commute, due to the non-trivial multimode entanglement
structure of the system. Hence, this pairwise description is not suitable for
describing the full system.

### [12] [Search for dynamical black hole captures with Gaussian mixture modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00481)
*Leigh Smith,Shubhanshu Tiwari,Michael Ebersold,Yeong-Bok Bae,Gungwon Kang,Ik Siong Heng*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文通过改进的cWB算法和GMM方法，在LVK第三次观测中搜索动态黑洞捕获事件，虽未发现新事件，但提高了灵敏度并更新了上限估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态黑洞捕获事件在密集天体环境中的引力波信号，以填补现有观测空白并提高探测灵敏度。

Method: 使用cWB算法结合GMM后处理，分为弱模型化和种群信息化的两种方法进行搜索。

Result: 信息化GMM方法显著提升灵敏度，探测距离达1.9 Gpc；更新了动态捕获事件的上限估计，最严格为0.15 Gpc⁻³yr⁻¹。

Conclusion: GMM方法有效提升动态捕获事件的探测能力，为未来观测提供重要参考。

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to originate from black holes
interacting dynamically in dense astrophysical environments. In such
environments, given that the velocity and cross section between the interacting
black holes is low, dynamical capture may occur. Such events merge on very
short timescales with high eccentricities and are expected to be detectable in
the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. In this work, we present a
dedicated search for dynamical black hole capture events in the third LVK
observing run with the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm enhanced with
Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) post-production. With this we consider two
applications of GMM: a weakly-modeled approach searching for generic short
transients under minimal assumptions, and a population informed approach, in
which the GMM model is provided information on the parameter space occupied by
the capture population. Although our search does not find any new significant
GW events, we find that an informed GMM approach brings significant sensitivity
improvements, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to a
distance of 1.9 Gpc for a 200 $M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary. We present updated
upper limit estimates of the rate at 90\% confidence, the most stringent of
which is 0.15 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a 34\% improvement with respect to previous
observational estimates. Furthermore, while the weakly-modeled GMM approach is
less sensitive to dynamical capture systems, we find that it is possible for
these events to be detected up to a distance of 1 Gpc in the cWB-GMM all-sky
short search under minimal assumptions. Finally, with the confident detection
of GW190521, we estimate the rate of similar events to be 0.94
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, assuming the event originated from a dynamical capture.

*L. Gallerani,A. Giusti,A. Mentrelli,V. Faraoni*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: Brans-Dicke引力在耦合常数ω→∞时并不总是退化为广义相对论，这一异常行为与化学势在爱因斯坦框架下的非零性有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Brans-Dicke引力在ω→∞极限下不退化到广义相对论的异常行为。

Method: 利用标量-张量引力的热力学第一定律形式体系进行分析。

Result: 发现这种效应与爱因斯坦框架下化学势在ω→∞极限下的非零性相关。

Conclusion: Brans-Dicke引力的异常行为可通过热力学类比中的化学势解释。

Abstract: Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit
$\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is
examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of
scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the
non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame
formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.

### [14] [Probing scalar field with generic extreme mass-ratio inspirals around Kerr black holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00516)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 未来空间引力波观测站将研究极端质量比旋进（EMRIs）中黑洞双星的特性，尤其是携带标量电荷的天体对引力波信号的影响。结果表明，轨道倾角增强了标量场效应的可探测性。

Motivation: 探索强引力场中广义相对论的潜在偏差，特别是标量场对EMRIs引力波信号的影响。

Method: 研究携带标量电荷的天体在偏心且倾斜轨道上的引力波信号变化。

Result: 轨道倾角显著增强了标量场效应的可探测性，波形特征偏离广义相对论预测。

Conclusion: EMRIs的偏心倾斜轨道为约束或发现新基本场提供了理想系统。

Abstract: The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to
provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of
black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in
which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black
hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the
strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general
relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar
fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the
inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that
present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters
affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave
signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in
particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing
richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic
case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides
a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs
with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently
constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational
wave observations.

hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed,
spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature
${K}$) which is strictly 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two
eigenvalues of $K$ is positive) then $V$ is either a spherical space or past
null geodesically incomplete \cite{Ling, Ling2}. In the present work we relax
the convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit
$2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two
eigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further
possibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\tilde V$ are surface bundles
over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if
$(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector
$\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the
decomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal
to $\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the
possible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the
base or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either
non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing
second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing
to covers. While our results do not use Einstein's equations, we provide
several classes of $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions of these equations as examples.

Abstract: Astrophysical black holes are usually surrounded by an accretion disk. At
least parts of these accretion disks consist of a plasma in which light rays
with different energies are dispersed. However, we usually do not know the
exact configurations of these plasmas. In this paper we will now use the
example of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in an inhomogeneous pressureless
and nonmagnetised plasma to investigate how the structural changes of the
photon rings can help us to determine the properties of a plasma surrounding a
black hole using multifrequency observations. For this purpose we will use a
simple analytic model which describes a plasma whose electron density increases
towards the equatorial plane when we approach the event horizon. For the chosen
model we will first derive and then analytically solve the equations of motion.
Then we will place an observer in the domain of outer communication and
introduce an orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion to
latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In the next
step we will use the analytic solutions to investigate the geometric structures
of the direct image as well as the photon rings of first and second order on
the observer's celestial sphere. We will write down a lens equation and
calculate the redshift and the travel time. We will compare the obtained
results to results for photon rings in vacuum and in the presence of a
homogeneous plasma. Finally, we will discuss which of these quantities can be
used to extract information about the properties of the plasma.

Result: 发现这些规则黑洞在所有质量下均可为极值黑洞，具有零表面引力，不受质量膨胀不稳定性影响；还发现一种可作为引力真空星的规则黑洞度规。

Conclusion: 通过引入矢量场和自由积分常数，成功构建了稳定的规则黑洞解，为黑洞物理提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from
four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the
metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector
fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry.
These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are
extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not
susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular
black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an
appropriate choice of integration constant.

Abstract: We investigate the geometric and physical properties of an anti-de Sitter
(AdS) black hole space-time coupled by a cloud of strings and surrounded by a
quintessence-like fluid, all within the framework of non-commutative (NC)
geometry. From the perspective of geometrical optics, we analyze the behavior
of null geodesics, focusing on key optical features such as the effective
potential, the structure and radius of the photon sphere, light deflection
angles, photon trajectories, and the resulting black hole (BH) shadow. Our
findings show that the combined effects of the string cloud and
quintessence-like fluid significantly modify photon dynamics and optical
observables, leading to notable deviations from standard BH scenarios in NC
geometry background. We also examine time-like geodesics, with particular
emphasis on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). The results
demonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO
radius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the
thermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking
temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The
influence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces
substantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in
phase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric
effects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field
perturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon
equation and reducing it to a Schr\"odinger-like form via separation of
variables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail,
highlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the
quintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC
geometry setting.

Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a flagship
ultraviolet/optical/infrared space telescope recommended by the National
Academies' Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics, will require
detector technologies capable of supporting significantly larger pixel-count
arrays than previous missions. Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs),
naturally suited to microwave multiplexing readout, are already in use across
several balloon-borne missions with FPGA-based systems. To transition this
capability to space, we are developing a radiation-hardened detector readout
system that builds directly on the technical and environmental requirements
defined by the PRIMA mission. PRIMA serves as a critical pathfinder, informing
the radiation tolerance, resource constraints, and on-board processing
capabilities needed for HWO. In this work, we present our current results on
algorithm implementation, hardware architecture, and firmware development using
the radiation-hardened AMD Kintex Ultrascale FPGA, aligning with PRIMA's
stringent specifications to ensure compatibility with future space-based

Abstract: The space-based CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP) mission aims to measure the
linear polarization of solar flares in the hard X-ray band by means of a
Compton scattering polarimeter. CUSP will allow to study the magnetic
reconnection and particle acceleration in the flaring magnetic structures of
our star with its unprecedented sensitivity to solar flare polarization. CUSP
is a project in the framework of the Alcor Program of the Italian Space Agency
aimed to develop new CubeSat missions. It has been proposed as a constellation
of a two Cubesat mission to monitor the Sun for Space Weather, and will proceed
with a single-satellite asset in its baseline implementation.
  In the frame of CUSP's Phase B study, that started in December 2024 for a
1-year period, we present the development status of this dual-phase
polarimeter. Preliminary laboratory results using two chains of acquisition
will be discussed. The first chain of acquisition, based on the Hamamatsu R7600
multi-anode photomultiplier tubes coupled to plastic scintillator bars and read
out by the MAROC-3A ASIC, is used to detect the Compton scattering of incoming
photons. On the other hand, GAGG crystals coupled to avalanche photo-diodes
with a readout based on the SKIROC-2A ASIC are used to absorb the scattered
photons. By reconstructing the azimuthal scattering direction for many incoming
photons, one can infer the linear polarization degree and angle of the source.
We will discuss the calibration results obtained with our prototype detector by
using well-known radioactive isotopes, allowing us to assess the performances
of our detector over the full 25-100 keV energy range.

Conclusion: 次级偏振的相干性需在设计高对比度成像系统时考虑，调制方案需适应次级强度的变化。

Abstract: Stellar coronagraphs designed for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets
inevitably introduce a small amount of instrumental polarization, called
\emph{secondary polarization}. At the contrast levels required to detect and
characterize terrestrial planets, these effects may become significant.
Instrumentally induced polarization is often referred to as ``incoherent," yet
this use of the term lacks rigor. This work uses Jones calculus and vector
field simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that
the secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does
not interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence
secondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the
primary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity
corresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \emph{secondary
intensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity
may lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs.
Additionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity
non-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental
light need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.

Abstract: The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for
meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit
area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the
Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the
system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its
highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear
nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera
body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by
40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a
bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8
in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via
YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than
a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be
used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring
scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor
outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new
Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the
Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid
meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid
meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena.
We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access,
real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.

Abstract: The 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen provides crucial information for
studying the early universe and its evolution. To advance this research,
countries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency
radio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square
Kilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal
for radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma
interference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become
increasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method
that combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method
involves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference
in radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal,
after removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet
transform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to
effectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed
signal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The
reconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to
refine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar
observation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The
results demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals
while preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy
observations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI).

Conclusion: MOSS系统为优化望远镜的热和气流管理提供了关键数据，有望提升图像质量。

Abstract: Deflection of light along the optical path is a major source of image
degradation for ground-based telescopes. Methods have been developed to measure
upper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere,
but due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is
more complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the
component of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of
refraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of
light that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's
detector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a
strobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations
transverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror'
seeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between
pairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence
within the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed
with different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at
different separations across the aperture of the telescope. Optical path
turbulence measurements, alongside other telemetry metrics, will guide thermal
and airflow management to optimize image quality. A MOSS prototype was
installed in the 1.2 meter Auxiliary Telescope (AuxTel) at the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory in Chile, and preliminary data constrain the optical path
turbulence with a lower bound of 1.4 arcseconds. The optical path turbulence
varied throughout the night of observing.

produced at different fabrication stages, as a model system. Leveraging our

from their distinct electro-rotation behaviors in water, spanning six orders of

Abstract: Quasi-zero stiffness (QZS) metamaterials are highly effective in isolating
objects from low-frequency external vibrations, due to their high static
stiffness but low dynamic stiffness characteristics. Traditionally, QZS
metamaterials are designed by combining a negative-stiffness part with a
positive-stiffness counterpart. Here, we present a novel QZS metamaterial
design without relying on combining two components. The QZS characteristic is
achieved solely through monolithic shell elements' unique geometry and
nonlinear deformation. Using experimental and numerical approaches, we
investigate the static and dynamic responses of the proposed metamaterials as a
function of their geometric parameters. We then tune the structure's geometry
to achieve ideal zero-stiffness behaviors and experimentally demonstrate an
exceptional low-frequency vibration isolation mechanism. This concept can be
further utilized as a building block for constructing metamaterials with
multiple zero-stiffness features, enabling a broad range of applications.

considerable electroluminescence (EL) down to bilayers. Intriguingly, the EL of
the spin-LED is discovered to be directly manipulated by spin-flip and
spin-canting transitions. Notably, spin-flip transitions enable unprecedented
hysteretic behaviors of EL characteristics, while spin-canting transitions
induce EL continuous modulation with robust anisotropy. This versatile
manipulation is originated from the synergy of magnetic-order mediated
excitonic transitions and spintronic transport. The prototype demonstration of
spin-LED establishes an indispensable scheme of opto-spintronic devices
leveraging 2D spin transitions and strong excitonic effects, presenting a
critical step towards integrated 2D opto-spintronics.
