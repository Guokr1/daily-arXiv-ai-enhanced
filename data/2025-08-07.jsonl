In particular, we\nintroduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) as a quantitative measure of\nthe mismatch between the transmitted and received symbol distributions induced\nby gravitational time dilation. Using a minimal communication model, we derive\nthe critical radius at which information decoding becomes thermodynamically\nimpossible due to the divergence of the KLD. We show that this radius\napproaches the Schwarzschild horizon in the limit where the information entropy\ncost becomes negligible relative to the transmission energy. This result\nprovides a novel information-theoretic interpretation of the event horizon as a\nboundary of irreversible information loss governed by universal thermodynamic\nprinciples. Our framework offers new insights into the entropic and energetic\nconstraints on communication in strong gravitational fields and may extend to\ngeneral relativistic and quantum information settings."}

By tuning the bilayer's\nfabrication parameters, on-demand wrinkle morphologies and color combinations\nare achieved.

Our extraction algorithm allows the computation of even-parity\n(Zerilli-Moncrief) and odd-parity (Regge-Wheeler) multipoles of the strain from\na (3+1) metric without the assumption that the spherical background is in\nSchwarzschild coordinates. The algorithm is validated with a comprehensive\nsuite of 3D problems including fluid ($f$-modes) and spacetime ($w$-modes)\nperturbations of neutron stars, gravitational collapse of rotating neutron\nstars, circular binary black holes mergers and black hole dynamical captures\nand binary neutron star mergers. We find that metric extraction is robust in\nall the considered scenarios and delivers waveforms of overall quality similar\nto curvature (Weyl) extraction. Metric extraction is particularly valuable in\nidentifying waveform systematics for problems in which the reconstruction of\nthe strain from the Weyl multipoles is ambiguous. Direct comparison of\ndifferent choices for the gauge-invariant master functions show very good\nagreement in the even-parity sector. Instead, in the odd-parity sector,\nassuming the background in Schwarzschild coordinates can minimize gauge effects\nrelated to the use of the $\\Gamma$-driver shift.

In quantum phononics,\nmechanical resonators at these frequencies can remain in their quantum ground\nstate even at kelvin temperatures, obviating the need for millikelvin cooling\ntypically required for GHz resonators. However, electrical actuation and\ndetection of mechanical motion at such high frequencies present significant\nchallenges, primarily due to the need for device miniaturization to support\nacoustic waves with nanometer-scale wavelengths. One effective strategy is to\naggressively thin down piezoelectric thin films, ideally to a thickness on the\norder of the acoustic wavelength, which is in the tens of nanometers. In this\nwork, we aggressively reduce the thickness of lithium niobate from 300 nm to 67\nnm through several stages, and fabricate suspended Lamb-wave resonators at each\nthickness level. These resonators achieve resonant frequencies as high as 220\nGHz, doubling the previous record and approaching the terahertz frequency\nthreshold. While ultrathin films exhibit a clear advantage in frequency gains,\nthey also experience increased acoustic losses. Our results suggest that future\nadvances in terahertz nanomechanics will critically rely on mitigating surface\ndefects in sub-100 nm thin films."}

Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre\nArray Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air\nshower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray\nobservations with unprecedented accuracy.

As such, it is ever more\ncrucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower\nprofile reconstruction efficiently.\n  In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal\nprofile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information\nField Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on\nBayesian inference.

This work presents a novel computational\nimaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive\noptics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use\nthe AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely\ncontrolled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images\nthat exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then\nbe jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we\nshow this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO\noperation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront\ndistortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate\nend-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the\nupsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal\nstatistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our\nexperimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,\ndemonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO\nsuper-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no\nhardware modifications.

Motivated partially\nby proposals to use gravitationally mediated entanglement of matter as a\nwitness for the quantum nature of gravity, we investigate how such entanglement\ncan be defined and investigated in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we ask\nhow a pair of fermions in a Bell state could be described in loop quantum,\ngravity.\n  We demonstrate that the notion of fermionic entanglement in loop quantum\ngravity is subtle, by showing that some potential ways to define it fail. We\nthen investigate a kinematical observable involving both, fermionic and\ngravitational degrees of freedom, the component of the fermion spin normal to a\nsurface. We study its properties, and compare it to the standard operator for\ncomponents of spin in a given direction in quantum mechanics. Using these\nnormal components of spin, we define a kinematical observable that measures the\ncorrelation between space-like separated fermions which closely mirrors the\nCHSH observable. Finally, we exhibit states of the fermions coupled to quantum\ngeometry that violate the Bell-CHSH inequality."}
