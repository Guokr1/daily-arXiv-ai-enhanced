Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully\nunderstand their parameter space when constraining them observationally,\nespecially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy\ndensities and future big rip singularities.

In this case, solutions oscillate as they approach the\nsingularity, just as in the vacuum case, and a similar behaviour is found when\na non-minimal coupling is included. If the scalar field contribution is not\nsubleading, then chaos is removed and the singularity is approached smoothly.\n  An unusual and entirely new result appears when changing the sign in front of\nthe scalar kinetic term, yielding the theory of a phantom scalar. If the scalar\nfield is subleading, then solutions remain chaotic and oscillate when\napproaching the singularity, as before. However, if the scalar field is not\nsubleading, solutions are also chaotic, but the spacetime singularity\ndisappears, and the universe behaves as an apparently infinite sequence of\nanisotropic bounces.

To reach that goal\nCONCERTO observed 1.4 deg2 in the COSMOS field. To ensure accurate calibration\nof the data, we have developed a forward model capable of simulating both the\nspectral response and the corresponding interferograms for each scan of\nobservation in the COSMOS field.
