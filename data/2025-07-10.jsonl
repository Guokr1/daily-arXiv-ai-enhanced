Characterizing the instrument's\nnoise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key\nrequirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a\ncrucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and\nastrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by\nassuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and\nof different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually\nresorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ\ntemplate-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an\nadditional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the\ninstrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of\nknowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall\npower spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of\nthe noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible\nJump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the\nlevel of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach\non simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions.

We use CoREAS simulations to adapt an existing signal model for the\nradio emission of inclined showers in the 30-80 MHz frequency band to the wide\n50-200 MHz band. Our model uses a parametrisation of the charge excess fraction\nto isolate the geomagnetic emission component. We reconstruct the geomagnetic\nradiation energy by fitting a lateral distribution function, provided by the\nmodel, to the geomagnetic energy fluence distribution of the shower. After we\ncorrect for the shower geometry and air density, we correlate the radiation\nenergy with the electromagnetic energy of the shower.\n  We show that the method intrinsic energy resolutions < 5% for the sites of\nthe Pierre Auger Observatory and GRANDProto300.

These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from\nthe vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals\nrequires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic\norder, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental\ninfluences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on\ngravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be\nredistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a\ndense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the\ninteraction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave\ndistinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to\nprobe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how\ndark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications\nperturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental\neffects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order."}

Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory\nfrequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through\ntheir coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for\nearly warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard\napproach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged\nfrequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative\napproach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis\nshows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved\nsignal-to-noise ratio and sky localization. Additionally, including subdominant\nmodes alongside the dominant $(2,2)$ mode leads to further improvements in sky\nlocalization. We explore the parameter space of primary mass $m_1 \\in [1.4, 15]\n\\, M_\\odot$, spin $\\chi_1 \\in [0, 0.8]$, and eccentricity $e \\leq 0.4$ across\nthree detector configurations: O5, Voyager, and 3G. We find that in the O5\n(Voyager) configuration, including eccentricity and subdominant modes, the sky\nlocalization area can be reduced by $2-80\\% (2-85\\%)$ at 1000 sq. deg. with\nincreasing eccentricity from $e_5 = 0.1$ to $e_5 = 0.4$, yielding up to $41$\nseconds (1 minute) of extra early warning time. For NSBH systems, subdominant\nmodes contribute up to $70$ $(94)\\%$ reduction for O5 (Voyager) scenario. In\nthe 3G detector scenario, the sky area reduction due to eccentricity reaches\n$80\\%$ (from $e_{2.5} = 0.1$ to $e_{2.5} = 0.4$) at 100 sq. deg., and\nsubdominant modes enhance the reduction up to $98\\%$ for NSBH systems."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the\nfuture of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's\nnoise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key\nrequirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a\ncrucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and\nastrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by\nassuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and\nof different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually\nresorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ\ntemplate-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an\nadditional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the\ninstrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of\nknowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall\npower spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of\nthe noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible\nJump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the\nlevel of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach\non simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the\nimpact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected\nsignal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a\nsuccessful SGWB detection."}
