Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone\nto nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if\nleft unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper\nfirst shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working\nHoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time\ncorrection of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately\ncalibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one\nof the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational\nwave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs,\nsuppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal\nof such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be\nreconstructed after the fact.
