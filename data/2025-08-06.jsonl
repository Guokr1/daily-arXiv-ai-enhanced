We designed an optical and\nmechanical system consisting of a separate scan high-speed atomic force\nmicroscope (HS-AFM) coupled to the BI-sSNOM optics. The designed AFM scanner\nhas a mechanical bandwidth of ca 70 kHz along the Z-axis, and ca 6 kHz along\nthe XY-axis, equivalent to the sample scanning HS-AFM.

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has\nbeen performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information\nextraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly\ndetection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the\npixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical\ninformation is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the\ndevelopment of image translation models for scientific use."}

However,\nits effectiveness is limited in crowded fields, and the choice of aperture size\ncritically impacts photometric precision. To address these challenges, we\npropose DeepAP, an efficient and accurate two-stage deep learning framework for\naperture photometry. Specifically, for a given source, we first train a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) model to assess its feasibility of aperture photometry. We\nthen train the Residual Neural Network (ResNet) to predict its optimal aperture\nsize. For aperture photometry feasibility assessment, the ViT model yields an\nROC AUC value of 0.96, and achieves a precision of 0.974, a recall of 0.930,\nand an F1 score of 0.952 on the test set. For aperture size prediction, the\nResNet model effectively mitigates biases inherent in classical growth curve\nmethods by adaptively selecting apertures appropriate for sources of varying\nbrightness, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across a wide\nrange of targets. Meanwhile, some samples in the test set have a higher SNR\nthan those obtained by exhaustive aperture size enumeration because of the\nfiner granularity of aperture size estimation. By integrating ResNet with the\nViT network, the DeepAP framework achieves a median total processing time of 18\nmilliseconds for a batch of 10 images, representing a speed-up of approximately\n59000 times compared to exhaustive aperture size enumeration.
