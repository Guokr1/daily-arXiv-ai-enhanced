This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted\nconsiderable attention in the recent literature.

The\ntemporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the\nfirst few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of\nhigh overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes.\nWe review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes,\nhighlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in\ngravitational wave data.
