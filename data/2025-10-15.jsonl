Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires\nconsideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial\ndistribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing\nnon-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution,\nand degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise\nobservation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ\nneutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of\nview 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and\ndistribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature\naccelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission\nattenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the\ntwo stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating\nnon-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss\nand liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying.\nFurther analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron\ntransmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of\nhydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying\ndoes not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively\ndecoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal\nthat high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while\nlow EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study\nunveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs,\noffering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and\ndurable battery development."}

This\nstudy investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific\ncapabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher\ninformation formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks\nfor large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars,\nand primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we\nmap the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations\nfulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics\nacross various network configurations.

This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very\nsensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to\ndelayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one\ndetector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics\nfor networks consisting of two next-generation facilities.

This framework allows the\nviscous fluid to remain far from equilibrium, an essential feature for a\nphysically consistent description of viscosity-driven accelerated expansion. We\nadopt the standard parametrization for the bulk viscosity, $\\xi = \\xi_{0}\n\\rho_{m}^{s}$, treating $s$ as a free parameter, and study the model in a\nspatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. By reformulating the\ncosmological equations as an autonomous dynamical system, we obtain both\nasymptotic analytical solutions and a numerical characterization of the phase\nspace. At early times, the viscous component can mimic a stiff fluid, while at\nintermediate epochs it behaves like dark matter. With a suitable choice of\ndynamical variables, the system admits three distinct classes of late-time\nattractors. Two of them are separated by a basin-boundary saddle point: (i) a\ngeneric quintessence solution for $s = 1/2$, which encompasses a de Sitter-like\nbehavior when $\\xi_{0}$ satisfies a specific relation involving the nonlinear\nparameters; (ii) a global exact de Sitter attractor for $s < 1/2$; and (iii) a\nphantom-like solution that emerges for $s \\ge 1/2$. In contrast to the generic\n$s \\ne 1/2$ case, the $s = 1/2$ scenario exhibits a qualitatively different\nstability structure, allowing de Sitter and phantom attractors to coexist.

Yet in the study of\nHawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often\nintroduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is\ngenerically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We\nrevisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four\nrepresentative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and\nD'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case\n$\\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation.\nWe compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter\ncan be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A\ncrucial role is played by the sign of the term $\\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in\nSchwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal\ncoupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier.
