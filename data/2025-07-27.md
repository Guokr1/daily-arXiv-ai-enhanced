TL;DR: STEPS仪器在Aditya-L1卫星上运行一年，性能稳定，数据可靠，对研究太阳风粒子有重要贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究太阳-地球L1点的能量粒子特性，为空间天气监测提供数据支持。

Method: 使用六个探测器单元观测粒子通量和能谱，并与现有仪器进行交叉验证。

Result: 四个探测器性能稳定，数据与其他仪器高度相关（R2~0.9），成功捕捉多种离子能谱。

Conclusion: STEPS仪器在L1点具有重要科学潜力，可用于粒子加速、传输及空间天气研究。

Abstract: The SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS), a subsystem of
the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) onboard India's Aditya-L1
satellite, is designed to study different aspects of energetic particles in the
interplanetary medium from the Sun-Earth L1 point using six detector units
oriented in different directions. This article presents details of the one-year
operation (08 January 2024 - 28 February 2025) of the AL1-ASPEX-STEPS after the
insertion of the satellite into the final halo orbit around the L1 point with
emphasis on performance, science observations, and scientific potentials. Four
out of six AL1-ASPEX-STEPS units exhibit a stable detector response throughout
the observation period, confirming operational robustness. This work also
includes the temporal variation of particle fluxes, spectra of ions during
selected quiet times and transient events, and cross-comparisons with existing
instruments at the L1 point. A strong correlation (with coefficient of
determination, R2 ~ 0.9) is observed in the cross-comparison study,
establishing the reliability of the AL1- ASPEX-STEPS observations.
AL1-ASPEX-STEPS also captures different forms of energetic ion spectra similar
to those observed by previous missions. These results underscore the
instrument's potential to contribute significantly to the study of energetic
particle acceleration, transport, and long-term space weather monitoring from
the Sun-Earth L1 vantage point.

### [2] [From Extraterrestrial Microbes to Alien Intelligence: Rebalancing Astronomical Research Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17790)
*Omer Eldadi,Gershon Tenenbaum,Abraham Loeb*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文探讨了天文研究资金分配的不平衡问题，指出地外智慧研究几乎未获联邦资助，而公众和科学家对其兴趣很高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示资金分配与科学价值和公众兴趣之间的不匹配，并呼吁重新考虑资助优先级。

Method: 通过分析公众和科学家的调查数据、心理学研究以及近期星际物体3I/ATLAS的案例，论证资金分配的不合理性。

Result: 研究表明，人类对地外接触的适应性反应强于历史认知，且资金不足导致对星际物体的研究机会丧失。

Conclusion: 结论是应建立一个全面的研究计划，探索星际物体上的生物和技术特征，以纠正制度性偏见并推动科学发现。

Abstract: We examine the funding disparity in astronomical research priorities: the
Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the
next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly
zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value
and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists
believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research
demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial
contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive
responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding
extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The
response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of
this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object
every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept
or closely study these visitors from outside the Solar System. We propose
establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and
technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound
public interest while advancing detection capabilities and enabling potentially
transformative discoveries in the search for extraterrestrial life. The
systematic exclusion of extraterrestrial intelligence research represents
institutional bias rather than scientific limitation, requiring immediate
reconsideration of funding priorities.

### [3] [A Sequential Unsupervised Learning Approach for Large, Multicolor, Photometric Surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17882)
*Bradley D. Hutchinson,Catherine A. Pilachowski,Christian I. Johnson*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LSTM自编码器的新方法，用于分析多波段测光数据，展示了其在恒星光谱能量分布重建和去噪方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模天文调查产生的复杂数据集对传统分析方法提出了挑战，需要新的机器学习技术来处理。

Method: 使用长短期记忆自编码器（LSTM-AE）将多色测光数据视为波长序列，编码到二维潜在空间中。

Result: 对3112259颗恒星的重建结果表明，99.51%的恒星光谱能量分布形状误差在0.05星等以内，且模型具有去噪能力。

Conclusion: LSTM-AE方法不仅能有效重建恒星光谱，还能检测稀有恒星类型，提升测光数据质量。

Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by
large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia
Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant
challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different
machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new
approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory
autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model views mean measurements of multicolor
photometry as a sequence in wavelength in order to encode patterns present in
the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent
space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use
globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS
images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259
stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED
shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and
the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a
magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially
improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of
rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed
photometry.

Abstract: The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the seventh Japanese
X-ray observatory whose development and operation are in collaboration with
universities and research institutes in Japan, the United States, and Europe,
including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite
are reduced to scientific products using pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL)
software running on standard Linux virtual machines (VMs) for the JAXA and NASA
sides, respectively. OBSIDs identified the observations, and we had 80 and 161
OBSIDs to be reprocessed at the end of the commissioning period and performance
verification and calibration period, respectively. The combination of the
containerized PPL utilizing Singularity of a container platform running on the
JAXA's "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system and working disk
images formatted to ext3 accomplished a 33x speedup in PPL tasks over our
regular VM. Herein, we briefly describe the data processing in XRISM and our
porting strategies for PPL in the HPC environment.

Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade Camera System is a novel calibration system designed to
calibrate the IceCube detector by measuring the optical properties of the
Antarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs,
which are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules
for the IceCube Upgrade. These units, deployed across the IceCube Upgrade
volume, will capture transmission and reflection images that can be used to
characterize the optical properties of both the refrozen ice within drill holes
and the bulk ice between strings. Additionally, the images can aid in
determining the positions of the optical modules the camera systems are mounted
on. To maximize the systems performance, various image analysis methodologies
have been explored, ranging from classical maximum likelihood estimation to
AI-based approaches using neural networks. In this study, we present
preliminary results on the performance of these methods based on images

### [7] [SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782)

TL;DR: SPLENDOR是一种新型探测器平台，结合窄带半导体目标和低噪声电荷读出技术，用于探测eV尺度以下的暗物质能量沉积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一种模块化、可扩展的系统，能够适应不同目标材料和信号读出技术，以探索亚MeV质量范围内的暗物质参数空间。

Method: 使用强关联f电子半导体和定制电荷读出技术（如cryoHEMT放大器），实现亚eV能量阈值和方向敏感性。

Result: 成功开发并校准了原型放大器链，在硅测试样品中实现了20±7电子的电荷分辨率。

Conclusion: SPLENDOR架构已准备好用于暗物质搜索，未来计划通过量子传感升级实现亚电子分辨率。

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector
platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge
readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV
scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to
accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.
SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated
f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not
only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming
dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily
modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic
high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching
single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of
Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype
detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier
chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon
test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a
demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment
in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.
Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of
athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background
environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing
performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our
ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR
provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing
with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass
range of dark matter parameter space.

### [8] [Three-dimensional position reconstruction of orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium detectors using maximum likelihood estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18222)
*Qiuli Zhang,Peng Zhang,Wenhhan Dai,Mingxin Yang,Yang Tian,Ming Zeng,Hao Ma,Zhi Zeng*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大似然估计的多参数联合重建方法，用于高纯锗探测器的三维位置重建，显著降低了噪声敏感性和系统偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在独立重建每个维度位置时存在噪声敏感性和系统偏差问题，需要更优的重建方法。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的多参数联合重建方法，利用积分参数减少电子噪声影响。

Result: 在100 keV光子下，Z方向最大重建偏差从0.4 mm降至0.02 mm，X/Y方向从0.4 mm降至0.016 mm，分辨率在0.07 mm至0.44 mm之间。

Conclusion: 该方法为高纯锗探测器的三维位置重建提供了有效解决方案，适用于医学成像和伽马射线天文等领域。

Abstract: Orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors can
reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) positions of photon interactions through
analysis of parameters extracted from multiple charge signals. The conventional
method independently reconstructs positions in each dimension using
amplitude-based parameters, leading to noise sensitivity and systematic biases.
In this study, we propose a multi-parameter-joint reconstruction method based
on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which establishes a mapping between
pulse shape parameters and corresponding 3D positions. To mitigate the effects
of electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction
performance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons
under 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z
reconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region
and from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes. The maximum reconstruction bias
in the X/Y directions was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.016 mm. Furthermore, the use
of integral-based parameters mitigated the rapid degradation of resolution
under high-noise conditions. The achieved position resolution ranged from 0.07
mm to 0.16 mm in the Z directions and from 0.07 mm to 0.44 mm in the X/Y
direction. This method offers a promising approach to 3D position
reconstruction with HPGe detectors for applications such as medical imaging and
gamma-ray astronomy.

### [9] [Reducing suspension control noise with interferometric sensors -- an experimental concept](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18369)
*Nils Leander Weickhardt,Artem Basaleav,Oliver Gerberding*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度频率调制的紧凑平衡读出干涉仪（COBRI），用于改进地面引力波探测器在30 Hz以下的位移传感性能，并通过实验设计验证其优于阴影传感器的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面引力波探测器在30 Hz以下的噪声主要来源于控制引起的位移噪声，需要更先进的局部位移传感技术。

Method: 设计实验，将COBRI安装在两个HRTS系统上，测量光学腔的长度稳定性，并模拟噪声水平。

Result: 模拟结果显示COBRI在纵向自由度上优于阴影传感器，尤其是在5 Hz附近。

Conclusion: COBRI在主动阻尼和绝对测距等功能上表现出潜力，但需改进测试设施的地震预隔离性能。

Abstract: One of the limiting noise sources of ground-based gravitational wave
detectors at frequencies below 30 Hz is control-induced displacement noise.
Compact laser interferometric sensors are a prime candidate for improved local
displacement sensing. In this paper we present the design of an experiment that
aims to demonstrate the advantages of interferometric sensors over shadow
sensors. We focus on the compact balanced readout interferometer (COBRI) - a
sensor currently in development that is based on deep frequency modulation. We
mount COBRIs on two HAM Relay Triple Suspension (HRTS) systems that suspend two
mirrors forming an optical cavity. By measuring the length stability of this
cavity relative to a stable reference we aim to probe the direct motion
reduction when using COBRIs for active damping and we aim to investigate their
behavior and auxiliary functions, such as absolute ranging, in the context of
the 6 degree-of-freedom controls of the suspensions. Here we describe the
design of the experiment and simulations of the achievable noise levels that
were obtained using mechanical models of the HRTS suspensions. We discuss all
relevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor
damping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing
facility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited
noise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate
superior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.

*M. Rooks,S. Abbaszadeh,J. Asaadi,V. A. Chirayath,M. Febbraro,M. Á. García-Peris,E. Gramellini,K. Hellier,B. Sudarsan,I. Tzoka*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 研究评估了非晶硒（a-Se）作为低温光电探测器材料的性能，通过实验验证了其在低光子通量、高电场条件下的响应特性，并首次观察到横向结构a-Se和a-SeTe器件在低温下的雪崩现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索a-Se在低温条件下的光电性能，尤其是雪崩效应，以支持其在下一代像素化液氩时间投影室（TPC）中的应用。

Method: 使用横向结构器件在定制光学测试台上进行实验，测量a-Se对低光子通量、高电场和窄带130 nm VUV光的响应，并对比a-SeTe的性能。

Result: 在87 K下，a-Se表现出高效的单一光子检测能力（效率≥80%，AUC≥0.85），并首次在横向结构中观察到雪崩效应。a-SeTe在相同条件下也表现出雪崩行为。

Conclusion: a-Se和a-SeTe在低温下表现出低噪声、VUV敏感性和雪崩增益，适合用于高电场兼容的光电探测系统，为下一代TPC提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector
material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally
structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies
investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high
electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive
response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130
nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) illumination. At 87 K, matched-filter analysis
shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to
80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using
as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to
approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for
geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures
using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference
and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a
tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under
identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in
a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible
low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a
lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of
avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at
cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of
laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon
time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible
photon detection systems.

### [11] [Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789)
*Shi-Bei Kong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了N维FRW宇宙在爱因斯坦引力、高斯-博内引力和洛弗洛克引力中的有效压力，发现其性质随维度和引力理论变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同引力理论下FRW宇宙的有效压力特性及其与普通压力的关系。

Method: 定义有效压力$P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$，分析其在三种引力理论中的行为。

Result: 爱因斯坦引力中有效压力恒为负且随视界半径减小；高斯-博内引力中$N\geq6$时有效压力有最小值；洛弗洛克引力中有效压力有多重零点和极值点。

Conclusion: 有效压力特性依赖于维度和引力理论，且在特定条件下与普通压力等价。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional
FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by
$P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the
volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure
in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with
the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is
different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this
case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The
effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and
extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting
relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is
equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this
condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了宇宙加速膨胀问题，分析了广义相对论及其替代理论（如远平行和对称远平行引力）的局限性和特征，并研究了$f(T,\mathcal{T})$理论、扭转-迹耦合引力、暗物质和暗能量的扩展模型，以及对称远平行引力的扩展形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究宇宙加速膨胀现象，探索广义相对论及其替代理论的局限性，并试图通过修正引力理论和扩展暗物质模型来解释宇宙的暗能量和暗物质问题。

Method: 采用$f(T,\mathcal{T})$理论、扭转-迹耦合引力模型、扩展的暗物质状态方程（EBEC EoS）和对称远平行引力的扩展形式，推导了FRW方程并分析了宇宙学意义。

Conclusion: 通过修正引力理论和扩展暗物质模型，为解释宇宙加速膨胀和暗能量问题提供了新的理论框架和可能性。

Abstract: Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and
limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric
teleparallel gravity. In Chapter2, we analyze the cosmological implications of
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ theory by considering the squared-torsion model
$f(T,\mathcal{T})= \alpha \mathcal{T}+ \beta T^2$, where $T$ represents torsion
and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In Chapter3, we
explore the inflationary scenario within the framework of torsion-trace
coupling gravity, utilizing a Lagrangian density derived from a function
denoted as $f(T,\mathcal{T})$. In Chapter4, we aim to investigate the dark
sector of the Universe, which encompasses the enigmatic components of the Dark
Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We consider an extended form of the Equation
of State (EoS) for DM, widely known as the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensation
(EBEC) EoS for DM. In Chapter5, we propose an extended formulation of symmetric
teleparallel gravity by generalizing the gravitational Lagrangian through the
inclusion of an arbitrary function of $f(Q,\mathcal{T_{\mu\nu}}
\mathcal{T^{\mu\nu}})$. We derived the FRW equations for a flat, homogeneous,
and isotropic spacetime. In Chapter6, we delved into the dark sector of the
Universe, specifically focusing on DM and DE. We examine an extended version of
the EoS for DM, commonly referred to EBEC EoS for DM, given as $p=\alpha \rho +
\beta \rho^2$, alongside the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian given by $f(Q)= \gamma
Q^2$.

Motivation: 扩展已知的黑洞热力学变量代数不等式（如彭罗斯不等式），纳入其导数关系。

Conclusion: 工作扩展了黑洞热力学变量的不等式范围，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at
fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes
($g_{tt} g_{rr}=-1$), we prove the bounds with suitable sufficient energy
conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the
bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known
algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the

Abstract: We present a systematic study of exact solutions for traversable wormhole
geometries in a static and hyperbolic symmetric spacetime. In the conventional
form of studying wormhole geometry, traversability requires the presence of
exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the
wormhole throat open. Using hyperbolic symmetry we obtain a solution already
provided with negative energy density that replaces this effect and allows us
to derive wormhole geometries that effectively violate the null energy
condition. To achieve this goal, we use a generalized complexity factor for
hyperbolic symmetry adapted to study wormhole geometries and with a suitable
redshift function in order to construct a Casimir-like traversable hyperbolic
wormhole. A detailed study has been conducted on the behavior of the matter
sector, the energy conditions, and the traversability conditions.

Abstract: Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity
(GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative
theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a
time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar
gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,
namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the
Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital
dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian
parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do
this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python
pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different
binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and
the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars
(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times
10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint
on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times
10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide
updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we
find that our results are consistent with GR.

TL;DR: 研究了在物质主导时期由原始波动坍缩形成的原始黑洞（PBHs），发现其形成阈值与峰值形状相关，且实际宇宙丰度下阈值更高。模型要求ζ_rms较大，但观测值远低于此，表明PBH形成效率仅略高于辐射主导时期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨物质主导时期原始黑洞的形成条件及其效率，以及与辐射主导时期的对比。

Method: 通过分析峰值形状对坍缩阈值的影响，结合峰值分布，计算有效阈值和PBH的自旋参数。

Result: 发现实际宇宙丰度下PBH形成阈值更高，且模型要求ζ_rms较大（约10^-1），远高于CMB观测值。自旋参数略高于辐射主导时期形成的PBH。

Conclusion: 物质主导时期PBH形成效率仅略高于辐射主导时期，且模型参数与观测值不符，表明其形成条件较为苛刻。

Abstract: We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare
primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The
collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as
they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat
perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the
growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the
initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$.
Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic
cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th}
\sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim
10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales.
Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than
Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be
$a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed
in Radiation Domination.

Conclusion: 非奇异黑洞模型在满足限制曲率条件的同时，对黑洞热力学和暗物质研究具有重要意义，为未来观测提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy
the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always
sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole
mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist
while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been
shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an
astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that
substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole
thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of
primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and
Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these
metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole
temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black
hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic
gamma ray background.

Result: 低频下各配置性能相近，高频下短跨度PD4L表现更优；时域分析下各配置等效。

Conclusion: PD4L因其高频性能和最小化无效频率，成为未来任务的有力候选方案。

Abstract: Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational
wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the
required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of
second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different
combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying
time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly
correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the
low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are
nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,
where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,
shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate
waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,
configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the
Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation
effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and
analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become
effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time
domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior
performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future
space-based GW mission designs.

Conclusion: 为半经典修正和量子效应对自引力致密天体及黑洞内部结构的建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric
static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial
coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical
system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate
variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or
quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general
relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to
non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism
through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians
describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with
linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians
that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to
renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the
singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free
black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning
from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside
Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both
semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure
of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.

Abstract: Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of
stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the
observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these
apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision
and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a
stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the
two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although
Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal
plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit
the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can
be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which
effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute
the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative
astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the
literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of
relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis
shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is
limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs
with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are
practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate
that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays
leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than
approximately 10^-7 Hz.

Conclusion: TDE模型是一种有前景的暗能量替代方案，不仅拟合效果更好，还保留了宇宙的热历史。

Abstract: Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean
Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological
Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with
regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam
level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the
particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective
dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the
latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can
immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of
the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this
TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic
evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We
confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with
Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations
(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model
selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but
statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we
show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the

electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our
universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges
arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate
arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear
stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the
result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field
system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.
