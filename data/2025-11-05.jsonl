The resulting field equations are studied\nunder barotropic equations of state with exponential and power-law shape\nfunctions. Finslerian anisotropy introduces novel pressure dynamics that enable\nthe classical energy conditions to be satisfied in specific parameter domains.\nOur analysis shows that the Barthel connection significantly extends the\nparameter space for non-exotic, physically viable wormholes compared to purely\nRiemannian models. These findings suggest that Finslerian modifications provide\na powerful mechanism for realizing realistic wormhole structures, offering new\nperspectives on anisotropic and geometrically enriched space-time\nconfigurations in extended gravity."}

While the\nlinear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a\nsecondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW\nsignals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the\nparabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing\nand emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events.\nHowever, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory\ncalculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead\nto incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case\nand use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational\nwave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism.\nUnlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice\nthat parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit\n(ZFL).

The test is performed on agnostic models, where the\npostmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at\nleast two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies\nand of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general\nrelativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is\nscaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the\nspin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\\ell$\nand the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different\ncombinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation\nof these islands through a semi-analytical argument. We discuss the application\nof the method to future detectors.

However, applications like low-background experiments that search\nfor rare physics, such as dark matter, neutrinoless double-beta decay, and\ncoherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, could profit a lot from a more\ndetailed understanding of the detector response close to the surface. The outer\n$n^+$ electrode of the $p$-type HPGe detector forms a layer with reduced charge\ncollection, and events originating here can be a critical background source in\nsuch experiments. If the difference in detector pulse shape between detector\nsurface and bulk events is known, it can be used to identify and veto these\nbackground events. However, a faithful simulation of the detector response in\nthis surface region is difficult and has not been available as a standard\nmethod so far. We present a novel three-dimensional pulse shape simulation\nmethod for this reduced charge collection (RCC) layer. We have implemented this\nmethod as a new feature in the open-source simulation package\n\\emph{SolidStateDetectors.jl} and show a validation of the numerical simulation\nresults with analytical calculations. An experimental study using a $p$-type\nHPGe detector also validates our approach.

We demonstrate that\nfits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically\npreferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also\nfind that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with\nthose of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits\nstruggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by\nlabeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr\nprograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with\nthe ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the\ndata better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When\nfitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the\ninclusion of a third mode, an ${(\\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone,\nimproves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of\ngeneral relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency\nspectrum.

In particular, we restrict our\nanalysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric\nfunction is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\\alpha$\nand of the one-form $\\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the\nconformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of\nconformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models\nobtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the\npresence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The\ngeneralized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the\nRiemannian metric $\\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nrepresentation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a\nspecific relationship between the component of the one-form $\\beta$ and the\nconformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is\ndetermined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free\nparameter $\\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological\nmodels are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic\nChronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of\n$\\gamma$.
