These experiments combine the electronic recoil blindness of a bubble chamber with the energy resolution of noble liquid scintillation, and maintain electron recoil discrimination at higher degrees of superheat (lower nuclear recoil thresholds) than Freon-based bubble chambers. A 10-kg liquid argon bubble chamber has the potential to set world leading limits on the dark matter nucleon cross-section for $O(\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})$ masses, and to perform a high statistics coherent elastic neutrino nuclear scattering measurement with reactor neutrinos. This work presents a detailed calibration plan to measure the detector response of these experiments, combining photoneutron scattering with two new techniques to induce sub-keV nuclear recoils: nuclear Thomson scattering and thermal neutron capture."}

The baseline implementation of the X-Arapuca concept for the FD-HD PDS module is close to the DUNE requirements as demonstrated in the collaborations laboratory testing. However, an increased performance would provide a safety margin for a detector planned to be operated for 30 years, without possibility of performing maintenance. A higher detector performance would also benefit the DUNE low energy physics program. The already proven Milano-Bicocca setup has been utilized to test different PDS module configurations comparing them to the original baseline.

The method yields the nucleus flux by fitting an azimuthal averaged profile with two amplitudes only PSF core and convolved coma, with transparent residual diagnostics.

Compared to traditional methods (parametric Moffat, ePSF template-based, and regularized likelihood), we demonstrate that our PSF models achieve orders of magnitude higher likelihood and residuals consistent with noise, all while remaining visually realistic. Further, the method applies even for faint and heavily masked point sources, merely producing a broader posterior.

The broadband response originates from two intrinsic deformation modes of the mass blocks between adjacent inclined slits: a rotational mode and a quadrupole mode. The spectral overlap of these two modes sustains a continuous high-efficiency band. The effect is robust against geometric variations, demonstrating that geometric asymmetry alone offers a minimal yet effective route to broadband elastic-wave mode conversion."}

However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $Λ$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $Λ$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski."}

Our goal was to manufacture the mid-infrared IOBC for NOTT based on the double-Bracewell architecture and run a detailed laboratory characterization in the L' band. We focus on the achievable raw and self-calibrated nulling ratios. We use a double Michelson interferometer to produce four broadband coherent beams simulating the four telescopes of the VLTI and perform broadband nulling at room temperature. We analyze the modal, chromatic, and polarization behavior of the IOBC, and measure its total throughput. We were able to manufacture a single-mode four-telescope double-Bracewell IOBC in GLS mid-infrared transparent glass using Ultrafast Laser Inscription. We show that the directional couplers forming the four-telescope IOBC (4T-nuller) have an achromatic splitting ratio across the band 3.65-3.85 um with a 40/60 and 50/50 splitting for the side couplers and the central coupler, respectively. We report a total throughput of 37%, including the Fresnel losses that will be mitigated with anti-reflection coatings, and quantify differential birefringence. Operating at room temperature, with 200 nm bandwidth centered at 3.8 um and without polarization control, we measure an average raw null of 8.13+/-0.03x10-3 and a self-calibrated null of 1.14+/-0.01x10-3.

X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) has two X-ray telescopes, one of which is Xtend, a CCD camera with a wide field-of-view (FOV) of 38 arcmin square.

However, existing gravitational wave-based tests have so far assumed non-eccentric signal sources, limiting their applicability to more general astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we present pTEOBResumS, a new parametrized inspiral-merger-ringdown model for null tests of GR that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession. Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dalí, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary. These allow us to establish the model's consistency, demonstrate its capability to identify beyond-GR effects, and gauge the impact of eccentricity in tests of GR. We then analyze a set of BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, testing whether they are best explained by a GR or non-GR waveform, under either the eccentric, spin-aligned or precessing, quasi-circular hypotheses. We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR. We find no strong evidence for imprints of orbital eccentricity in the analyzed events, with the exception of GW200129. For this, our analysis finds a strong preference for an eccentric, GR-consistent description, although as previous works have noted this result could be influenced by data quality issues."}

It is important to account for the complete stellar population captured within a radio telescope's field of view, or stellar 'bycatch'. In recent years, catalogues from ESA's Gaia mission have enabled SETI surveys to place tighter limits on extraterrestrial transmitter statistics. However, Gaia remains restricted by magnitude limits, astrometric uncertainty at large distances, and confusion in crowded regions. To address these limitations, we investigate the use of the Besançon Galactic Model to simulate the statistical underlying stellar population to derive more realistic constraints on the occurrence of extraterrestrial transmitters. We apply this method to Breakthrough Listen's Enriquez/Price survey, modelling 6,182,364 stellar objects within 1229 individual pointings and extending the search out to distances $\\leq 25$kpc. We place limits on the prevalence of high duty cycle transmitters within 2.5kpc, suggesting $\\leq (0.000995 \\pm 0.000002)\\%$ of stellar systems contain such a transmitter (for near-zero drift rates and EIRP$_{\\mathrm{min}} \\gtrsim 5 \\times 10^{16}$W). In support of broader adoption, we provide a simple calculator tool that enables other researchers to incorporate this approach into their own SETI analyses. Our results enable a more complete statistical estimation of the number and stellar type of systems probed, thereby strengthening constraints on technosignature prevalence and guiding the analysis of future SETI efforts. We also conclude that SETI surveys are, in fact, much less biased by anthropocentric assumptions than is often suggested."}

Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case.

We assess dataset representativeness using UMAP analysis, confirming broad and consistent coverage of feature space. An XGBoost classifier, with hyperparameters tuned using automated optimization, is trained using purely photometric data (60-band J-PAS magnitudes) and combined photometric and morphological features, with performance thoroughly evaluated via ROC and purity-completeness metrics. Incorporating morphology significantly improves classification, outperforming the baseline classifications available in the catalogs. Permutation importance analysis reveals morphological parameters, particularly concentration, normalized peak surface brightness, and PSF, alongside photometric features around 4000 and 6900 A, as crucial for accurate classifications.

In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($Λ^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\\sqrt{Λ^{(0)}/Λ^{(2)}} \\equiv Mω_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\\sim 5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Λ^{(2)}$ relation and $\\sim 2.5\\%$ for the $Λ^{(0)}$-$Mω_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space."}

The photonic lantern (PL) can be used to sense aberrations at the final science imaging plane. This enables a two-stage wavefront control architecture, in which the first-stage wavefront sensor senses atmospheric turbulence and the PL senses NCPAs and other aberrations not seen by the first stage.

Starting from the free Kemmer field in an accelerated reference frame, we establish eigenvalue equations resembling those of the Klein--Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates. By introducing the Dirac oscillator interaction through a momentum substitution, we derive an exact closed-form spectrum for the Kemmer oscillator, revealing how the acceleration parameter modifies the characteristic length, shifts the discrete energy spectrum, and lifts degeneracies. In the Minkowski limit $a\\to 0$, the standard Kemmer oscillator spectrum is recovered, ensuring consistency with flat-spacetime results. These findings provide a tractable framework for analyzing acceleration-induced effects, with implications for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum gravity, and analogue gravity platforms."}

Using the Einstein's field equations in metric $f(R)$ gravity we model solutions for both wormhole as well as $f(R)$ gravity. We obtain four different wormhole models, two wormholes are characterised by solid angle deficit, three are not asymptotically extendible, while one is asymptotically flat with zero tidal force. These are supported by four different power law $f(R)$ models. The parameter space of the models can support both null energy conditions (NEC) satisfying as well as violating wormhole. In case of NEC satisfying matter, the associated $f(R)$ is ghost. The $f(R)$ models obtained have been independently substantiated for cosmological feasibility and valid parameter space was obtained corresponding to cosmologically viable $f(R)$. Suitable scalar-tensor representation of the corresponding $f(R)$ models have been presented using the correspondence of $f(R)$ gravity with Brans-Dicke (BD) theory of gravity. The robustness of the wormhole solutions were further analysed with the BD scalar fields in the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which showed excellent results. Lastly as an independent astrophysical probe for the wormhole we have obtained the location of their photon spheres and have connected them with the Herrera Complexity factor in $f(R).$ Our results show that the relation between the complexity factor and existence of photon spheres remains fundamentally unaltered in $f(R)$ as compared to Einstein's gravity."}

The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity."}

The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated.

We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l<0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\\left(ρ+p\\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system.

These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging. Beyond the critical point, we find a new region of parameter space where the threshold solution is an extremal black hole. We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes.
