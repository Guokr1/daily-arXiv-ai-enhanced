### [2] [Faint southern spectrophotometric standard stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05758)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文研究了适合作为ELT望远镜MICADO仪器光谱标准星的DA白矮星，提供了14颗候选星的参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ELT望远镜需要比现有更暗的光谱标准星，尤其是近红外波段，以满足未来仪器的需求。

Method: 使用VLT的X-shooter仪器观测24颗候选DA白矮星，结合3D纯氢模型大气和多波段测光进行分析。

Result: 筛选出14颗可靠的光通量校准星，其光谱与模型拟合残差在大部分波段小于3%。

Conclusion: 这些DA白矮星可作为MICADO等仪器的光谱标准星，满足K=14至16星等的需求。

Abstract: Context. The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the
collecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual
Unit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Fainter spectrophotometric
standard stars than those currently available in the V = 11 to 13 mag (K = 12
to 14 mag) range are required for spectroscopic observations with instruments
such as the Multi-AO Imaging Camera for Deep Observations (MICADO) on the ELT,
notably in the near-infrared wavelength regime. Aims. We identify suitable
spectrophotometric standard stars among white dwarfs with hydrogen atmospheres
(DA white dwarfs) in the magnitude range K =14 to 16 mag and provide reference
data based on stellar model atmospheres. Methods. We observed 24 candidate DA
white dwarfs with the X-shooter instrument on the VLT, covering the wavelength
range 300 nm to 2480 nm in three arms. We took care to include stars at
latitudes below and above -25 degrees to allow observations for all wind
directions at the location of the ELT. The spectra were analysed using model
fluxes from 3D pure-hydrogen local thermodynamic equilibrium model atmospheres
and multi-band photometry. From the sample of observed targets, we selected 14
reliable flux calibrators. For these targets, the residuals from the match
between the model best-fit models and the observed spectra across the full
wavelength range are < 3%, with the exception of the UV regions affected by the
ozone Huggins bands (300 nm - 340 nm) and regions contaminated by telluric
lines. Results. We have identified and fully characterised 14 DA white dwarfs
that can be used as spectrophotometric standard stars for the MICADO instrument
as well as any other future instrument with similar requirements in the
brightness range, K = 14 to 16 mag (Vegamag), and provide reference fluxes

### [3] [Stacked Hybrid RNN-CNN Reconstruction of X-ray Influence on 21-cm Brightness Temperature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05842)
*S. Mobina Hosseini,Bahareh Soleimanpour Salmasi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合LSTM、GRU和CNN的混合模型，用于高效模拟X射线通量对再电离时期21厘米亮度温度的影响，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究X射线光子对再电离时期IGM的热和电离状态的影响，传统模拟方法计算成本高且难以高效探索高维参数空间。

Method: 采用结合LSTM、GRU和CNN的混合模型，训练于特定模拟数据，以快速适应不同X射线通量水平。

Result: 模型计算时间减少一百万倍，预测准确率达99.93%，误差小于0.35 mK。

Conclusion: LSTM-GRU-CNN混合模型为研究X射线加热效应提供了高效、可扩展的分析工具。

Abstract: The X-ray photons substantially affect the thermal and ionization states of
the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), thereby
significantly influencing the 21-cm line observables such as its sky-averaged
(global) brightness temperature. Nevertheless, the complicated dependency of
astrophysical processes on a broad spectrum of parameters, including X-ray
efficiency, spectral characteristics, and gas dynamics, makes precisely
simulating the effect of X-ray flux challenging. Traditional approaches,
including N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, are computationally intensive
and struggle to explore high-dimensional parameter spaces efficiently. We
present a stacked hybrid model trained on a specific simulation intended to
reconstruct the effect of X-ray flux on the global 21-cm brightness temperature
during the EoR. Along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this
architecture combines two substantial forms of recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), therefore
enabling fast adaptation to several X-ray flux levels. Without demanding
repeated simulations, this emulator preserves temporal and spatial dependencies
and generalizes to unseen parameter combinations. This matter reduces
computation time by a factor of one million while preserving excellent
prediction accuracy of 99.93\%, facilitating studies on high-dimensional
parameter inference and sensitivity with an error margin of less than 0.35 mK.
Our LSTM-GRU-CNN emulator combines recurrent and convolutional architectures to
enable a robust and scalable analysis of X-ray heating effects on the global
21-cm brightness temperature during the EoR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DTW作为一种灵活且成熟的模式匹配算法，在天文学数据分析中尚未广泛应用，本文旨在探索其在天文光谱校准中的潜力。

Method: 使用校准模板光谱作为参考，通过DTW算法恢复非线性和不连续的色散解，算法对模板与样本数据之间的分辨率差异具有鲁棒性，并能容忍部分虚假或缺失特征。

Result: 通过模拟和实际弧光灯光谱数据，验证了DTW在自动化数据还原流程中的有效性。

Conclusion: DTW算法在波长校准中具有实用价值，本文还介绍了包含DTW校准方法的PyKOSMOS数据还原工具包。

Abstract: Here we present an automated method for obtaining wavelength calibrations for
one-dimensional spectra, using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). DTW is a flexible
and well-understood algorithm for pattern matching, which has not been widely
used in astronomy data analysis. Employing a calibrated template spectrum as a
reference, DTW can recover non-linear and even discontinuous dispersion
solutions without an initial guess. The algorithm is robust against differing
spectral resolution between the template and sample data, and can accommodate
some spurious or missing features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DTW in
an automated data reduction workflow, using both simulated and real arc lamp
spectra in a Python data reduction framework. Finally, we provide a discussion
on the utility and best practices with the DTW algorithm for wavelength
calibration. We also introduce the PyKOSMOS data reduction toolkit, which
includes our DTW calibration methods.

### [5] [A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon counting detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05730)
*Vincenzo Monaco,Luca Brombal,Pasquale Delogu,Alessandro Feruglio,Massimiliano Fiorini,Renata Longo,Luca Marchetti,Anna Maria Poli,Luigi Rigon,Valeria Rosso*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 提出了一种独立于模型的方法，用于校正像素化光子计数探测器在能量分辨X射线采集中的电荷共享光谱畸变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电荷共享效应会导致能量分辨X射线采集中的光谱畸变，影响数据准确性。

Method: 通过均匀辐照和多色光谱校准，确定基于重合的响应矩阵（CBRM），计算电荷共享概率，构建探测器响应矩阵以校正光谱。

Result: 验证表明，该方法能有效恢复光谱信息，性能接近标准聚类算法，且比模拟电荷求和技术更少受噪声影响。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效且独立于输入光谱的电荷共享校正方案。

Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge
sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with
pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the
determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a
preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary
polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number
of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different
combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing
probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response
matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra
acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator
electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The
technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector
and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick
silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the
reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3
offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute
percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the
spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms
and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.

Abstract: As liquid xenon time projection chambers scale to ever-larger sizes, so too
do the engineering challenges they pose. We describe a large, flexible,
multipurpose test facility capable of supporting the development of a number of
key aspects of liquid xenon detector systems. Example applications of this
facility include characterization of large-area light and charge sensor arrays,
tests of xenon purification techniques and materials compatibility, and
investigations into high-voltage phenomena. This facility uses an automated and
remotely monitored cryo-cooling system based on immersion of the test chamber
in a liquid bath rather than conductive coupling, leading to advantages in
temperature and pressure stability, as well as increasing required response
times in the case of cooling-power loss. Design advantages, operational
procedures, and performance of the facility are described, as well as five
examples of liquid xenon test chambers that use the facility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高性能硅探测器阵列，用于未来ALICE升级探测器FoCal，以研究低Bjorken-x区域的物理现象。

Method: 通过IV和CV测量进行电学表征，使用$^{90}$Sr源和10 GeVπ介子束测试探测器性能，并与Geant4模拟进行比较。

Result: 探测器表现出均匀的响应和高于5.5的信噪比，与模拟结果一致，适用于FoCal的电磁和强子段。

Conclusion: 该探测器性能优异，是未来FoCal探测器的理想候选者。

Abstract: This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of
p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory
(SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\times$~9 array of
1~$\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the
High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization
of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage
(CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages
across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD)
device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam
tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle
(MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads
with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower
profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten
absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the
corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector
show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector
named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of
low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the
electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the
direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low
Bjorken-x region.

### [8] [Studies on the effect of low-fluence proton and neutron irradiation on n-type LGADs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06282)
*Veronika Kraus,Marcos Fernandez Garcia,Salvador Hidalgo,Michael Moll,Jairo Villegas*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 研究探讨了低能量质子和中子辐照对n型低增益雪崩探测器（nLGADs）的影响，揭示了辐照导致的泄漏电流和电容变化，以及空间电荷符号反转现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究nLGADs在辐射环境中的潜在应用，并探索n型材料与增益层结合的基础现象。

Method: 通过测量泄漏电流和电容（I-V和C-V）以及退火实验，分析辐照效应。

Result: 发现辐照导致空间电荷符号反转，影响电场分布和耗尽行为，结果与先前高能质子研究一致。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对nLGADs在辐照下基本行为的理解，支持其在辐射环境中的应用。

Abstract: The presented study investigates the effects of low fluences from
$5\times10^{12}$ up to $1\times10^{14}$ particles/cm$^{2}$ of 60MeV proton and
neutron irradiation on n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (nLGADs). An nLGAD
is a silicon sensor with a highly doped gain layer that enables controlled
charge multiplication via impact ionization. In contrast to the
well-established p-type LGADs for high-energy physics (HEP) applications,
nLGADs are optimized for the detection of low-penetrating particles such as UV
photons and soft X-rays. In addition to studying their potential application in
environments with radiation backgrounds, these novel devices also enable the
exploration of the underlying phenomenology arising from the combination of
n-type bulk material with a gain layer, which degradation was previously
studied predominantly in the context of p-type LGADs. The irradiation effects
were characterized through measurements of the leakage current and capacitance
with increasing bias voltage (I-V and C-V), revealing systematic and
fluence-dependent behavior related to space charge sign inversion (SCSI) of the
n-type bulk material, which especially alters the electric field in the sensor
and thus the depletion behavior. Additionally, annealing studies were performed
to assess both beneficial and reverse annealing regimes with isothermal and
isochronal annealing. The findings are consistent with previous high-energy
proton studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental
behavior of nLGADs under irradiation.

*Hangyu Shi,Jun Wang,Guofu Cao,Wei Wang,Yuehuan Wei*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: TAO实验开发了两种顶点重建方法（CCA和DLA），性能优于设计要求，适用于类似实验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为TAO实验实现高精度顶点重建，以测量反中微子能谱。

Method: 优化并比较电荷中心算法（CCA）和深度学习算法（DLA）。

Result: CCA和DLA在1 MeV下的顶点分辨率分别优于20mm和12mm，满足实验需求。

Conclusion: 两种算法不仅为TAO实验做好准备，还具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped
liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino
Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy
spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To
fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is
crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the
charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We
describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare
their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods
can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias<5mm) and 12mm
(bias<1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO
experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only
prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant
potential for application in other similar experiments.

*Yining Xie,Eoin Moynihan,Marin Alexe,Louis Piper,Ana Sanchez,Richard Beanland*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的4D-STEM分析方法，通过模板匹配优化成像，显著提升原子分辨率成像能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统虚拟明场或暗场成像中用户定义掩模的局限性，提供更精确的原子柱成像方法。

Method: 利用图像（模板）与4D-STEM数据的相关性生成掩模，优化成像效果。

Result: 成功分别成像LiFePO4中的Li和O原子柱，以及PbTiO3中的O、Pb和Ti原子柱。

Conclusion: 模板掩模为4D-STEM数据分析提供了一种计算简单且通用的方法，特别适用于中等厚度样品。

Abstract: We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction
pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam
across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character,
forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a
STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a "virtual" bright field or
dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a
complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to
obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the
template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image
optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom
columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as
virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the
approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti
across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally
straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly
effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering
produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.

TL;DR: 论文展示了将MacDowell-Mansouri连接的基本长度尺度视为动态变量（宇宙标量场）时，其场方程与共形爱因斯坦方程等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MacDowell-Mansouri连接在动态长度尺度下的性质，及其与共形爱因斯坦方程的关系。

Method: 通过构造一个作用泛函，其变分得到的场方程在壳上与共形爱因斯坦方程等价。

Result: 动态长度尺度下的场方程等价于共形爱因斯坦方程，且时空点被宇宙标量场参数化的齐次空间近似。

Conclusion: 共形变换后的广义相对论在几何上与标准广义相对论存在显著差异，表现为时空点的局部近似方式不同。

Abstract: In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin
connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie
algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$.
From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may
formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by
constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field
equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this
article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the
MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a
cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of
the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on
shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable
geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally
transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in
spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to
a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar
field.

Motivation: 探索一种基于紧致化几何和介质激发的替代方法，以确定可观测耦合和阻止本领，同时支持各向异性和非线性响应现象。

Method: 从五维不变作用量出发，紧致化后得到四维有效理论，介质响应通过对称张量场耦合电磁和费米部分。

Conclusion: 该模型为研究阻止本领和粒子射程提供了一种新方法，同时揭示了额外维度效应在实验室系统中的潜在影响。

Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive
collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired,
five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification,
obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are
treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is
encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic
and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim
\Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 =
\frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied,
the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large
$R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative
approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to
determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically
supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as
gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the
study of stopping power and particle range.

Result: 发现Horndeski理论空间中存在广泛的弱引力区域，并扩展了非零第五力的引力区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使替换ΛCDM膨胀模型为DESI w0waCDM最佳拟合，仍能生成稳定的弱引力区域。

Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing
on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This
letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity
theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling
stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the
inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently
released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis
functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the
stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on
models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at
late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a
dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We
find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also
include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$,
and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force.
Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI
$w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.

Abstract: We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves
computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical
relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as
the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain
Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null
infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational
collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering,
and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation
methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet
efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable
to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications.
Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but
the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal
schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.

Abstract: It is expected that a quantum theory of gravity will radically alter our
current notion of spacetime geometry. However, contrary to what was commonly
assumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much
larger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the
superposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems
whose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very
promising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this
work, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant
formalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account
for the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings
with external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the
(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when
attainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in
terms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When
this decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even
with couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We
then apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of
quantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)
charged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our
clocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix
$\rho_{\tau_2|\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields
not only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical
expected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum
fluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile.

Conclusion: IR/UV混合现象在量子引力研究中具有重要意义，并为实验测量提供了新的解释。

Abstract: IR/UV mixing (a mechanism causing ultraviolet quantum-gravity effects to
manifest themselves also in a far-infrared regime) is a rare case of feature
found in several approaches to the quantum-gravity problem. We here derive the
implications for "soft" IR/UV mixing (corrections to the dispersion relation
that are linear in momentum) of some recent cold-atom-interferometry
measurements. For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish
bounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length
milestone. Intriguingly, for values of the characteristic scale of about half
the Planck length we find that IR/UV mixing provides a solution for a puzzling
discrepancy between Cesium-based and Rubidium-based atom-interferometric
measurements of the fine structure constant.

Motivation: 研究早期宇宙中量子引力效应的重要性，尤其是在宇宙膨胀期间量子真空扰动被拉伸到宇宙尺度时，传统方法假设背景态接近经典态，但本文探索了非经典背景态的可能性。

Method: 采用量子轨迹方法，通过eikonal近似定义背景态的非经典行为，同时保持Born-Oppenheimer分解的有效性。

Result: 量子轨迹方法下，背景态最终表现出接近经典的行为，但对原始扰动功率谱的预测与传统方法有显著差异。

Conclusion: 非经典背景态可能对早期宇宙的扰动预测产生重要影响，为量子引力效应在宇宙学中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Predictions from early universe cosmology typically concern primordial
perturbations generated during epochs where effects arising from the quantum
nature of gravity may be important; quantum vacuum fluctuations being stretched
to cosmological scales during a phase of inflation. Quantizing the background
is then done by assuming a single close-to-classical state over which
perturbations grow, as well as a Born-Oppenheimer factorization throughout the
relevant phase. We present a scenario in which although the latter
factorization remains valid at all times, we allow the background state to be
very non-classical by defining quantum trajectories through an eikonal
approximation. We find that these trajectories asymptotically reproduce an
almost classical behavior for the background, but the predictions for the power
spectrum of perturbations can significantly differ.

Abstract: Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure
Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the
underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work,
we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in
the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric
orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional
parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions,
our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more
natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting
from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute
the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their
observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework
thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle
effects in gravitational wave data.

Abstract: We establish the existence of a family of static, spherically symmetric
spacetimes that are solutions of the Einstein Field Equations of General
Relativity coupled to the electric field of a static point charge obeying the
equations of electromagnetism of Maxwell-Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky. The
point charge is modeled as a naked singularity with non-positive bare mass. The
singularity at the location of the charge is milder than that of the
Reissner-Weyl-Nordstr\"om solution to the conventional Einstein-Maxwell
equations, and, contrary to what happens for the latter, the electric-field
energy of these solutions is finite.

Result: 解适用于无压尘埃和暗能量流体，满足虫洞的物理条件（如无事件视界、能量条件可控）。

Conclusion: 证明了$F(T)$引力与dRGT质量项结合是构建自洽虫洞几何的有效框架。

Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel class of exact, static, spherically
symmetric traversable wormhole solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity
augmented by the non-linear de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) graviton mass term.
By using the Morris-Thorne ansatz with a generalized redshift function
including constant, logarithmic, and power-law profiles, we rigorously
integrate the dRGT-modified conservation laws together with the teleparallel
field equations to reconstruct both the shape function $b(r)$ and the possible
torsion-based teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. Our solutions, which accommodate
both pressureless dust and dark-energy perfect fluids, are naturally expressed
via special function representations. We verify the flaring-out condition
$b'(r_0)<1$, demonstrate the absence of event horizons, and show that the null
and weak energy conditions are either strictly satisfied or incur only
controlled violations at the throat. These results establish teleparallel
massive gravity as a self-consistent, mathematically rich framework for
asymptotically flat wormhole geometries without necessarily invoking an
explicit cosmological constant.

signature of individual mode resonances excited during the inspiral of binary
systems involving neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify how each resonant
mode contributes to the effective (frequency-dependent) tidal deformability.
The resonant solution is shown to be accurately represented by a new
closed-form approximation, which sheds light on the involved phenomenology, and
which should be useful for the development of precise waveform models and
future parameter extraction efforts.

Conclusion: 该框架为损伤力学提供了一种高效且表达力强的数据驱动方法，适用于多种材料类型。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven constitutive framework for anisotropic damage
mechanics based on the second-order damage tensor approach for both
compressible and incompressible materials. The formulation is thermodynamically
consistent and satisfies the Clausius-Duhem inequality. The strain energy
density potentials are expressed as isotropic functions of the right
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, along with structural tensors that encode
anisotropy either present in the virgin material or resulting from damage. To
guarantee the polyconvexity condition, non-decreasing convex neural networks
with inputs that ensure polyconvexity are used to parameterize the strain
energy density potentials. The model vanishes in the undeformed state,
fulfilling the normality condition. In contrast to classical [1-d] damage
models, the expressiveness of the new data-driven model is enhanced by
employing a family of nonlinear, convex, decreasing functions to capture the
effect of damage. Damage evolution is governed through a damage potential,
where the corresponding threshold is defined in terms of the damage conjugate
forces. As a special case of the general formulation, a new anisotropic generic
format is introduced to predict constitutive responses under damage-induced
anisotropy in initially isotropic materials. To reduce the computational burden
during training, a decoupled training scheme is introduced, and its accuracy is
demonstrated in all numerical examples. These include benchmarks for
incompressible isotropic, transversely isotropic, and compressible orthotropic
materials. The framework is also validated against experimental data capturing
anisotropic Mullins-type damage.

Abstract: In this work we introduce a compact model for mushroom-type phase-change
memory devices that incorporates the shape and size of the amorphous mark under
different programming conditions, and is applicable to both projecting and
non-projecting devices. The model includes analytical equations for the
amorphous and crystalline regions and uniquely features a current leakage path
that injects current at the outer edge of the electrodes. The results
demonstrate that accurately modeling the size and shape of the phase
configurations is crucial for predicting the full-span of the RESET and SET
programming, including the characteristics of threshold switching.
Additionally, the model effectively captures read-out behaviors, including the
dependence of resistance drift and bipolar current asymmetry behaviours on the
phase configurations. The compact model is also provided in Verilog-A format,
so it can be easily used in standard circuit-level simulation tools.

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以指导高性能磁热材料的设计，推动高效磁制冷系统的实现。

Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) provides a promising foundation for the
development of solid-state refrigeration technologies that could replace
conventional gas compression-based cooling systems. Current research efforts
primarily focus on identifying cost-effective magnetic materials that exhibit
large MCEs under low magnetic fields across broad temperature ranges, thereby
enhancing cooling efficiency. However, practical implementation of magnetic
refrigeration requires more than bulk materials; real-world devices demand
efficient thermal management and compact, scalable architectures, often
achieved through laminate designs or miniaturized geometries. Magnetocaloric
materials with reduced dimensionality, such as ribbons, thin films, microwires,
and nanostructures, offer distinct advantages, including improved heat
exchange, mechanical flexibility, and integration potential. Despite these
benefits, a comprehensive understanding of how size, geometry, interfacial
effects, strain, and surface phenomena influence the MCE remains limited. This
review aims to address these knowledge gaps and provide guidance for the
rational design and engineering of magnetocaloric materials tailored for
high-performance, energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration systems.

Abstract: We present a class of mechanical lattices based on elliptical gears with
quasiperiodic modulation and geometric nonlinearity, capable of exhibiting
topologically protected modes and amplitude-driven transitions. Starting from a
one-dimensional chain of modulated elliptical gears, we demonstrate the
emergence of localized edge states arising from quasiperiodic variation in the
gears' moments of inertia, analogous to the topological edge modes of the
Aubry-Andre-Harper model. Under increasing excitation amplitude, the system
undergoes a nonlinear transition, where edge localization breaks down and
energy delocalizes into the bulk. By coupling multiple such chains with varying
modulation phase, we construct a two-dimensional lattice in which the phase
acts as a synthetic dimension. This structure supports topological wave
propagation along the synthetic dimension. Nonlinearity again induces a
breakdown of topological states, leading to complex, amplitude-dependent wave
propagation. We further propose a numerical continuation approach to analyzing
the periodic orbits and their linear stability, effectively discovering the
boundary of the basin of bounded motion and detecting the occurrence of
delocalization under certain excitation amplitudes. Our results reveal that
elliptical geared systems offer a passive, amplitude-dependent platform for
exploring topological phenomena and synthetic dimensionality in mechanical
metamaterials.

Abstract: Linking electrode microstructure to electrochemical performance is essential
for optimizing Li-ion batteries. However, this requires mechanistic 4D
observations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined
with Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both
particle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging
image analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its
formation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite
particle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon
clusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all
have a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility
- but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify
fast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic
depth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion
limitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery
performance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of
influence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials
and electrode manufacturing.
