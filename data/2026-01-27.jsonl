Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime and signal pile-up, leading to systematic inefficiencies in conventional coincidence-based trigger systems. Such triggers typically rely on binary temporal windows and assume continuous sensor availability, causing partial or complete loss of correlated signal information during non-live intervals. We introduce Recursive Manifold Coherence (RMC), a geometric framework that reformulates distributed trigger logic as a continuous state estimation problem in a low-dimensional information space defined by correlated charge and timing observables. Instead of applying hard vetoes during deadtime, the proposed method employs a recursive update rule that propagates a coherence state across sensor nodes, allowing partially obscured signals to be retained and evaluated consistently. Using simulation studies representative of large optical detector arrays, we demonstrate that RMC successfully recovers event-level coherence for high-multiplicity topologies even when direct coincidence chains are broken. By treating the detector response as a smooth manifold rather than discrete hits, the framework achieves superior robustness against data fragmentation compared to standard binary logic. The framework is detector-agnostic and compatible with software-defined trigger pipelines, providing a flexible foundation for deadtime-aware analysis and triggering strategies in future distributed detector systems."}

This work presents a novel two-stage classification framework for gamma-neutron discrimination: an initial physics-based energy threshold filters unambiguous low-energy gamma sources, followed by a machine learning ensemble that resolves ambiguities at higher energies. The detector response was characterized using $^{60}$Co (1.17/1.33~MeV), $^{137}$Cs (0.66~MeV), and a shielded $^{241}$AmBe source, with lead, paraffin, and cadmium shielding employed to isolate neutron and gamma interactions. Energy calibration established a linear ADU to MeV conversion ($R^2 = 0.966$), enabling identification of a neutron detection threshold at $2.62 \\pm 0.77$~MeV via a $3σ$ significance analysis. Stage one categorizes sources as pure gamma (below threshold) or neutron-emitting (at threshold). For ambiguous cases above threshold, a machine learning pipeline utilizing pulse shape analysis was developed.

While near-field dipolar theory is well established, its application to characterizing/identifying nanoparticles immersed in complex media at THz frequencies is largely unexplored.\n  This work utilizes numerical simulations of magneto-optical (MO) heterodimers -- comprising n-doped Indium Antimonide (n-InSb) and isotropic or birefringent particles (e.g., SiO2, GaSe) -- under counter-propagating, circularly polarized THz illumination. We demonstrate that while far-field observables like absorption cross-sections are often dominated by the MO-active particle, mechanical variables-specifically induced binding forces and spin/orbital torques-exhibit superior sensitivity for detecting \"hidden\" neighboring components. Because these mechanical signatures depend directly on near-field interactions, they provide higher information density regarding interparticle coupling.\n  Key findings reveal material-specific spectral \"hotspots\" and \"zeros\" that serve as robust calibration markers even within dispersive biological surrogates. We show that the spin torque on non-MO particles is significantly modified by MO-neighbor proximity, a phenomenon controllable via static magnetic fields.

We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $φ$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline."}

The hydrogen atom is treated as a four-level hyperfine system in a holding magnetic field, and transitions driven by harmonic components of the bunch-induced magnetic field are analyzed using time-dependent quantum-mechanical evolution along atomic trajectories. Numerical tracking of hydrogen atoms through the beam region is performed using nominal EIC beam parameters.

In depth understanding of the heat transport mechanisms and their quantification is crucial for building efficient opto-thermal management strategies for optimization of the aforementioned systems. The present work serves to identify and quantify the key heat transfer mechanisms operative in a host of optically transparent thermal loss mitigators. In particular, comprehensive experimental modelling frameworks have been developed to investigate the efficacy of carbon dioxide gas (CO2), air, vacuum (0.07mbar), transparent heat mirrors (Indium tin oxide coated glass) and aerogels (silica-based) in mitigating thermal losses. Detailed and careful experimental modelling reveals that it is imperative to employ more than one thermal loss mitigator and choose correct absorber surface orientation (relative to the irradiation direction) to maximize thermal loss mitigation. Magnitude of absorber surface stagnation temperature has been employed as the figure of merit to quantitatively compare various optically transparent thermal loss mitigators.

In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST."}

Submitted to CHEP 2026", "summary": "Large-scale neutrino observatories operate under unavoidable detector deadtime arising from photomultiplier saturation, digitizer limits, and front-end readout constraints. Conventional coincidence-based trigger logic implicitly assumes continuous sensor availability and therefore suffers systematic efficiency loss when channels become temporarily non-live. This work presents the design of a liveness-aware trigger architecture targeting low-latency FPGA deployment in distributed optical arrays. We introduce a recursive Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) update law implemented as a fully synthesizable pipeline that constructs a continuity-preserving effective observable at each sensor node. Rather than collapsing during non-liveness intervals, the observable decays smoothly while retaining phase and amplitude information relevant for network-level coherence estimation. By explicitly separating continuous measurement construction from discrete trigger decision logic, the proposed architecture enables graceful degradation under partial channel non-liveness. Performance is evaluated using a hybrid validation framework that combines representative event topologies derived from IceCube Open Data with a hardware-accurate signal and noise model spanning a wide dynamic range. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed trigger sustains high event recovery efficiency in regimes of elevated deadtime probability, where conventional coincidence logic degrades substantially. Furthermore, the continuity-preserving observable yields up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in effective signal-to-noise ratio, enabling robust detection under strong saturation and non-ideal operating conditions. This method provides a robust foundation for next-generation firmware-level trigger strategies in large-scale, noise-dominated detector systems."}

For this analysis we make use of the fact that the wave equations for both types of material are similar, with the roles of time and space interchanged. However, the principle of causality holds for both types of material, hence, here the roles of time and space are not interchanged. We find that:\n  (1) whereas classical time-reversed acoustics involves emission of a time-reversed single-component wave field from a (ideally closed) boundary into the inhomogeneous material, its idealized counterpart involves emission of a sign-reversed two-component wave field, recorded in a time-reversed material, from a single time instant into the actual time-variant material;\n  (2) whereas classical Green's function retrieval involves temporal crosscorrelation of wave fields at two space locations in response to single-component sources on a (ideally closed) boundary, its counterpart involves spatial crosscorrelation of wave fields at two time instants in response to two-component sources at a single time instant."}

Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $ξ=ξ_{0}\\left|Q\\right|^{1/2}$, being $ξ_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=νH^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $ν$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($χ_{\\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $Λ$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion.

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines."}

Using high-resolution tracking, the spatial distribution of light yield was mapped with a granularity of 0.5 mm. An average light response map was obtained by combining data from 27 cubes. Optical crosstalk between adjacent cubes was also measured and characterized in four directions (left, right, up, down). Position-dependent crosstalk values ranged from 2% to 6%, with the highest levels observed near cube interfaces.

Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $Λ$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $Λ$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $Λ$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams.

This work presents an enhanced conditional generative adversarial network (optiGAN) replacing optical simulations at the crystal array level, extending our single-crystal approach to a 3x3 BGO array. We enhance the Wasserstein-GAN framework with Fourier feature encoding, a learnable latent mapping network, and a physics-informed loss enforcing momentum conservation. Training data is reduced eight-fold by exploiting symmetry. Evaluation employs three studies: a full array evaluation testing generalization from the fundamental domain to the complete geometry, a high-resolution study probing out-of-distribution generalization to untrained positions, and a pencil beam $γ$-photon study assessing practical applicability for experimental detector characterization. Performance is benchmarked against GATE10/Geant4 ground truth, using intrinsic fluctuations between independent Monte Carlo runs as baseline. OptiGAN achieves sliced Wasserstein similarity within 3$σ$-agreement of the baseline across all conditions, demonstrating successful generalization to the full array. The model transitions from electron-emission training data to realistic $γ$-photon interactions, producing flood maps that reproduce characteristic patterns including photopeak clusters and inter-crystal scatter lines. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that physics-informed generative models can accurately simulate optical photon transport in segmented scintillator arrays.

By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge."}

While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \\to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential.

The resulting Hamiltonian contains distinct curvature couplings modifying the internal potential and affecting the center-of-mass dynamics. These contributions imply that internal-energy variations do not always reduce to mass renormalization and can induce genuine forces due to changes in momentum.

The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $μ$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $μ$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased.

We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE.

From their perspective, the gravitational collapse of a dust star is completed in a finite proper time, independently of their initial distance from the star. In contrast, observers described by Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates perceive the boundary of the collapsing star as taking an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon.\n  We emphasize that Schwarzschild-Droste observers are static with respect to the center of mass of the star and therefore cannot be in free fall. The use of these coordinates implicitly requires the presence of a force that compensates the gravitational attraction.
