We demonstrate that this approach {encounters fundamental symmetry violations} across multiple independent criteria, all traceable to a single fundamental cause: the breakdown of general covariance and BRST symmetries above the gravitational cutoff scale. Rigorous canonical quantization proves that general covariance cannot be maintained quantum mechanically in dimensions greater than two, while recent path integral calculations reveal persistent gauge parameter dependence in quantum gravitational corrections, signaling BRST symmetry violation. These dual proofs establish that the metric tensor ceases to exist as a valid quantum degree of freedom above $Λ_{\\text{grav}}$$\\sim$$10^{18}$ GeV, rendering the search for ultraviolet fixed points in metric-based theories {problematic from a foundational physical perspective}. We provide comprehensive analysis demonstrating that asymptotic safety exhibits persistent gauge parameter dependence where fixed-point properties vary with arbitrary gauge choices, non-convergent truncation schemes extending to the 35th order showing no approach to stable values, experimental {tensions} with electroweak precision tests by orders of magnitude, matter content requirements incompatible with the Standard Model, absence of concrete graviton predictions due to gauge and truncation dependence, unitarity {challenges} through ghost instabilities and propagator negativity, and fundamental Wick rotation obstructions preventing reliable connection between Euclidean calculations and physical Lorentzian spacetime. We contrast this with the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity framework that systematically avoids all asymptotic safety pathologies."}

Adopting a linear functional form $f(\\mathscr{Q},\\mathscr{L}_m) = -α\\mathscr{Q} + 2\\mathscr{L}_m + β$, we derive the field equations for a static, spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne wormhole geometry with vanishing redshift function. Four distinct shape functions are considered: $b(r)=\\sqrt{r_0 r}$, $b(r)=r_0\\left(\\dfrac{r}{r_0}\\right)^γ$ (with $0<γ<1$), and $b(r)=\\dfrac{r_0 \\ln (r+1)}{\\ln (r_0+1)}$. The geometric viability of each configuration is verified through standard traversability conditions, including the flaring-out requirement and asymptotic flatness. We analyze the energy conditions and demonstrate that, consistent with known results in wormhole physics, the null energy condition is violated in the vicinity of the throat, indicating the presence of exotic matter. In addition, we employ embedding diagrams to visualize the spatial geometry of the wormhole solutions, providing a clear geometric interpretation of the flaring-out condition at the throat. Our results suggest that $f(\\mathscr{Q},\\mathscr{L}_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework for constructing traversable wormholes, with the non-minimal matter-geometry coupling influencing both the geometry and the matter sector."}

Yet these systems are typically designed as static, hand-tuned menus of selection criteria grounded in prior knowledge and simulation. In this work, we further explore the concept of a self-driving trigger, an autonomous data-filtering framework that reallocates resources and adjusts thresholds dynamically in real-time to optimize signal efficiency, rate stability, and computational cost as instrumentation and environmental conditions evolve. We introduce a benchmark ecosystem to emulate realistic collider scenarios and demonstrate real-time optimization of a menu including canonical energy sum triggers as well as modern anomaly-detection algorithms that target non-standard event topologies using machine learning. Using simulated data streams and publicly available collision data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, we demonstrate the capability to dynamically and automatically optimize trigger performance under specific cost objectives without manual retuning. Our adaptive strategy shifts trigger design from static menus with heuristic tuning to intelligent, automated, data-driven control, unlocking greater flexibility and discovery potential in future high-energy physics analyses."}

A simple transformation relates the generators of Cl(3,1) to a real representation of Cl(2,2), while the real representation of Cl(2,2) serves directly as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(4). Therefore, although GL(4) does not contain a spinor representation of the Lorentz group, expanding its Lie algebra in the Cl(2,2) basis gives a Clifford valued connection with well-defined coupling to Dirac spinors. Variation of the expansion coefficients gives new Dirac sources for both torsion and nonmetricity, separated by identifying the so(3,1) basis within the gl(4) basis."}

Ring-contact (ring-and-groove) designs address scalability by shaping the electric field to preserve low-capacitance readout, but their nonplanar topology motivates a lithium-contact process that is compatible with conformal deposition and robust high-voltage operation. As a process demonstration toward future ring-contact prototypes, we fabricate and characterize a hybrid-contact planar HPGe device, KL01. Here, ``hybrid'' denotes an $n^{+}$ contact formed by an in-house lithium-suspension paint followed by controlled thermal diffusion, combined with an AJA-developed a-Ge/Al $p^{+}$ contact and a-Ge sidewall passivation.

The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background."}

Previous work has already demonstrated that fs-lasers are uniquely suited for the fabrication of piezoelectric actuators based on PMN-PT, which are required for multiaxial strain-tuning of quantum dots (QDs) to enable, e.g. the generation of highly entangled photon pairs. Building on these foundations, the present work advances actuator performance and capabilities by introducing a local thinning strategy. This approach allows the realization of smaller devices, which in turn enables lower operating voltages, while simultaneously offering the possibility of integrating multiple quantum light sources on a single chip. The article provides a detailed description of the full fabrication chain, entirely based on fs-laser processing steps, from substrate thinning to metal layer structuring and final device definition. A particular focus is placed on the final cutting process, where the implementation of a third-harmonic ultraviolet (UV) fs-laser wavelength significantly improves edge quality and shape definition compared to the second harmonic (SH) wavelength used in previous work. The device fabricated through the combination of local thinning and UV-based cutting promises not only to enhance the efficiency of strain transfer but also to ensure the mechanical stability required for practical applications. These results establish fs-laser-based fabrication as a versatile and scalable method for next-generation piezoelectric actuators, paving the way for advanced strain-engineering approaches in semiconductor quantum optics and integrated quantum photonics."}

The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.\n  This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage.

We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities.

One typically finds that each additional factor of the loop counting parameter can induce up to a certain number of logarithms of the scale factor. Loop corrections that attain this number are known as ``leading logarithms''; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models. We show that the first sub-leading logarithm is captured by applying the stochastic formalism to a certain part of the 1-loop effective potential.

Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude."}

Based on Nash's embedding theorem, the model introduces orthogonal perturbations via variations in the extrinsic curvature, generating scalar-type metric perturbations directly from geometry, without the need to introduce additional fields. We confront the model with current observational data, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements from Planck, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2, and recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) compilations. Our analysis shows that Nash gravity provides a good fit to the data, yielding a slightly higher value for the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 69.32 \\pm 0.72$ km/s/Mpc, compared to the $Λ$CDM model, thus offering a potential alleviation of the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, the model naturally predicts a suppressed growth of structure, with $S_8 \\approx 0.76$ across various joint analyses, potentially alleviating the so-called $S_8$ tension, assuming that this discrepancy is not solely due to systematic effects in other independent measurements. In some cases, Nash gravity achieves a better fit to the data than the $Λ$CDM paradigm at the $2σ$ level."}

In the canonical sector ($α=1$), the radial tidal force exhibits a transition marked by a sign inversion between the horizons $r_{-}$ and $r_+$, signaling internal regimes of radial compression analogous to those of charged black holes; the parameter $l$ controls the strength and location of this transition, while $γ$ regulates the nonlinear electromagnetic contribution. The angular tidal force is predominantly compressive, $l$ shaping the effective geometry, and $γ$ acting as a damping factor. In the phantom sector ($α=-1$), tidal forces and geodesic deviation diverge, indicating a tidal instability, with $l$ and $γ$ affecting only the magnitude of the response. We further show that $l$ shifts the relation between the horizon radius $r_+$ and the tidal disruption radius $r_{\\rm Roche}$, thereby modifying the critical (Hills) mass defined by $r_{\\rm Roche}=r_+$. Tidal disruption of neutron stars occurs inside the horizon for supermassive black holes, whereas Sun-like stars are disrupted outside the horizon, with $γ$ becoming relevant only for ultramassive black holes with masses $\\sim 10^{8}M_{\\odot}$. Our results demonstrate that Kalb-Ramon-ModMax effects are largely suppressed for supermassive black holes, but may be relevant for intermediate-mass systems and observable tidal disruption events, offering an indirect probe of Lorentz violation and nonlinear electrodynamics in the strong-field regime."}

In this study, we assess the accuracy of the eikonal and post-Kerr approximations in predicting the quasinormal mode spectrum of a scalar field on a deformed Kerr spacetime. To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy. We also report that near-horizon deformations can affect prograde and retrograde modes differently and provide a geometrical explanation."}

The construction enforces the exact face-on (polar) limit by explicitly separating an analytically computed polar contribution based on the spherical photon-orbit branch where the horizontal impact parameter vanishes. The remaining inclination dependence is captured by a compact 15-parameter polynomial placed inside an exponential correction. The coefficients are determined by ordinary least squares on a deterministic reference grid generated from the Kerr critical-curve area. Over the practical domain of dimensionless spin from 0 to 0.998 and inclination from just above 0 degrees up to 90 degrees (with the exactly polar point treated analytically), the surrogate achieves sub-percent accuracy. On the training grid the median absolute percent error is 0.0105 percent with a worst case of 0.782 percent, and on a denser out-of-sample validation set (including inclinations down to 0.5 degrees) the median, 95th-percentile, and worst-case errors are 0.023 percent, 0.471 percent, and 1.64 percent, respectively. The resulting expression provides fast evaluations of the shadow size without numerical ray tracing, making it convenient for repeated calls in parameter inference and rapid model comparisons."}

Reliable inference of the source properties is crucial for accurate interpretation of its astrophysical implications. However, characterization of GW231123 is challenging: only few signal cycles are observed and different signal models result in systematically different parameters. We investigate whether the interpretation of GW231123 is robust against model systematics and Gaussian detector noise. We show that the model systematics observed in GW231123 can be reproduced for a simulated signal based on the numerical-relativity surrogate model NRSur7dq4. Simulating data using the maximum-likelihood NRSur7dq4 waveform for GW231123 and no noise realization, we closely recover the systematics observed for the real signal. We then explore how the headline properties of GW231123 are impacted by Gaussian detector noise. Using the NRSur7dq4 maximum-likelihood waveform and different noise realizations, we consistently find support for large masses, high spin magnitudes (median $χ_1\\geq 0.7$), and high spin precession (median $χ_\\mathrm{p}\\geq 0.68$). The spin in the direction of the angular momentum ($χ_\\mathrm{eff}$) fluctuates more. Finally, again comparing to simulated signals, we show that any differences in the GW231123 inference based on each separate detector are not statistically significant. These results show that the properties of GW231123, and most importantly the high mass and high spin magnitudes inferred by NRSur7dq4, are robust."}
