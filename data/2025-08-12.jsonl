It is not easy to develop a\ncoherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard\nGeneral Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of\nthe very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm\nbasis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which\nInflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\\,$ this, of course, includes the\nvast majority of such theories -- $\\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that\nspacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is\ncompletely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the\n``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be\nconfirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from\nthe outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly\nmetric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far\nthe most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm\npredictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the\ndegree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component\nof the Hubble tension."}

The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of\nM87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the\nLorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger\nobserver inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like\nstructure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow\nand the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters\nreduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical\ncurve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift\nsignificantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we\ncompute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The\nresults indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the\nblueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the\nblack hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study\nthe polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the\npolarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and\nhigher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner\nshadow.

In this paper, we\nexplore quantum hair by deriving the quantum-corrected black hole metric within\nthe Barvinsky-Vilkovisky formalism. The quantum-corrected metric is obtained\nperturbatively around flat spacetime without assuming either the commutativity\nbetween the nonlocal operator and covariant derivatives or the nonlocal\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, both of which are adopted in previous studies. Using this\nmetric, we evaluate the deflection angle in the strong-field limit and compute\nthe associated strong gravitational lensing observables, such as the angular\nseparation and the relative magnification. Our results show that as the quantum\nhair, determined by the number of virtual massless quantum fields in the\nnonlocal effective action, increases, the photon sphere radius, the strong\ndeflection angle, and the relative magnification all increase, whereas the\nangular separation decreases. In addition, the role of quantum hair is\ndiscussed in the weak and strong naked singularities. As a result, we\ndemonstrate that the quantum hair affects not only the black hole geometry but\nalso its strong gravitational lensing effects."}

The instability below\nthe threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that\ngeneral naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV\nperturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic\ncensorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on\nthe exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface\nformation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel\napproach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming\nnull cones becoming more and more singular."}

Dubey", "Sanved Kolekar"], "title": "Memory Effects and Entanglement Dynamics of Finite time Acceleration", "comment": "36 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We construct a smooth trajectory in Minkowski spacetime that is inertial in\nthe asymptotic past and future but undergoes approximately uniform acceleration\nfor a finite duration. In a suitable limit, this trajectory reduces to the\nstandard Rindler trajectory, reproducing the expected Bogoliubov\ntransformations and results consistent with the thermal time hypothesis. We\nanalyze the behavior of an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector following such a\ntrajectory and explore the dependence of complete positivity (CP) divisibility\non the detector's frequency, acceleration, and the duration of acceleration.\nNotably, we find that the detector exhibits a memory effect due to the finite\nduration of acceleration, which is also quantified by the Fisher information.\nWe further examine two UDW detectors along various trajectory combinations and\nshow that, unlike the transition rate, both the total correlation and the\nentanglement harvested return smoothly to their initial values after the\nacceleration/deceleration phase. These correlation measures behave similarly in\nboth accelerating and decelerating segments. Interestingly, negativity and\nmutual information remain unaffected by the memory effect. We also discuss the\nphysical significance of the sign of the flux of acceleration-induced\nradiation."}

We calculate the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent across the\ntransition and show that it acts as an order parameter, exhibiting a critical\nexponent $\\delta=1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point.
