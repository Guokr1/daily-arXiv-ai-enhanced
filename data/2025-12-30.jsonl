In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations."}

By numerically solving the scalar-field equation with a double-well potential, we show that the wormhole throat parameter $a$ has a strong impact on the dynamics of the radial kink: larger $a$ leads to wider throats and allows the domain wall to oscillate across the throat with large amplitude, whereas smaller $a$ confines the motion nearby the throat. In addition, each time the kink crosses the wormhole throat, it emits scalar wave packets, causing its oscillation amplitude to gradually decrease. Our results reveal how the wormhole geometry influences the motion of defects and their energy transfer, providing new insights into the dynamics of topological defects in exotic spacetime."}

However, quantitative monitoring of microbubble oscillations in the stable, weakly nonlinear regime remains challenging, particularly in optically opaque and deep-tissue environments. Here, we introduce a linear acoustic wave propagation and superposition (LAWPS) framework that reconstructs microbubble radius-time dynamics directly from passively recorded acoustic emissions. By coupling Fourier-series representations of weakly nonlinear oscillations with linear monopole radiation theory, LAWPS extends classical monopole models to establish a reversible relationship between multi-frequency acoustic emissions and underlying radial bubble dynamics. Extending this framework to monodisperse microbubble ensembles, we derive optimal excitation and receive configurations and population-level correction factors that enable quantitative reconstruction of the ensemble-averaged microbubble dynamics. Using simultaneous optical and acoustic measurements, we demonstrate recovery of microbubble oscillations with ~5% relative error for oscillation amplitudes up to ~15% of equilibrium radius. Finally, we show that oscillations within the framework's operating regime (20% oscillation) generate sonoporation-relevant mechanical stress in vesicles as small as 10 micrometers (capillary number > 0.01), under physiologically relevant conditions. Together, this work establishes a quantitative framework for acoustic emission-based monitoring of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in clinically relevant, optically inaccessible environments to enable improved control of emerging ultrasound diagnostic and therapeutic technologies."}

Emerging dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) confront the conventional approach of extracting such a model from a numerical simulation with multiple challenges. First, the cost of accurately simulating an intricate and electrically large DMA architecture might be prohibitive. Second, the model-reality mismatch due to fabrication inaccuracies might be substantial, especially at higher frequencies and for DMA architectures leveraging strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) to maximize their tunability. These considerations motivate an experimental parameter estimation for DMA forward models. The main challenge lies in the forward model's non-linearity due to inter-element MC. Multiport network theory (MNT) can accurately capture MC but the MC parameters cannot be measured directly. In this article, we demonstrate the experimental estimation of a high-accuracy proxy MNT model for a 19-GHz DMA with 7 feeds and 96 elements, where all feeds and elements are strongly coupled via a chaotic cavity. For a given DMA configuration and excitation, our proxy MNT model predicts the reflected field at the feeds and the radiated field with accuracies of 40.3 dB and 37.7 dB, respectively. A simpler, MC-unaware benchmark model only achieves 2.6 dB and 3.3 dB, respectively. We systematically examine the influence of the number of feeds and measured DMA configurations on the model accuracy, motivating the inclusion of \"auxiliary calibration feeds\" to facilitate the parameter estimation when the intended DMA operation is limited to a single feed. Finally, we measure DMA configurations optimized based on our proxy MNT model."}

Such activity can pose significant operational challenges for critical infrastructure operators, particularly those managing electricity transmission networks, satellite constellations, and aviation systems. Substantial progress has been made in understanding space weather and the potential exposure of infrastructure assets to severe events. We have seen few evaluations of the types of current mitigation strategies in use to reduce our shared vulnerability to this activity, motivating this study. Firstly, we fill an important literature gap by undertaking a systematic review of the range of space weather mitigation strategies for these three critical infrastructure sectors. Secondly, we contacted 303 critical infrastructure operators (50 power, 227 satellite, 26 aviation) for participation in an anonymous online survey or interview receiving 55 unique responses (18% response rate). To capture narratives of mitigation actions taken and impacts experienced over the solar maximum, qualitative interviews were then conducted with 33 operators. The results identified 91 potential mitigation actions within the sectors and found that 149 mitigation actions were enacted due to space weather forecasts and experienced impacts. This is one of the first exhaustive studies of space weather mitigation activities, and moves beyond the traditional focus on purely impacts."}

Such objects require regions of negative energy density -a condition typically regarded as unphysical within the context of conventional stellar models. Nevertheless, negative energy densities arise naturally in traversable wormhole geometries, where the violation of the null energy condition is essential to sustain the flaring-out behavior at the throat. This connection suggests that ghost-like configurations may find a natural realization within wormhole physics. In this work, we investigate the existence of ghost configurations by analyzing their associated Hawking mass. Although in spherical symmetry the Misner and Hawking masses are known to coincide, we show that when the ghost condition is extended beyond spherical symmetry and applied to the Hawking mass, it faces topological obstructions that hinder its straightforward realization. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that a Casimir-like traversable wormhole can be naturally constructed within this framework. Finally, to illustrate the properties of the resulting geometry, we analyze its Penrose-Carter diagram."}

We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range.

The corresponding energy density is regular and localized, featuring a central peak with symmetrically placed negative minima. Through the analysis of linear tensor perturbations, we derive a Schrödinger-like equation with supersymmetric factorization, ensuring the absence of tachyonic modes and thus the stability of the background configuration.

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}

When the scalar potential vanishes, scalar-hairy black holes emerge with profiles and properties similar to those observed in flat spacetime. The presence of the scalar potential additionally induces tachyonic-hairy solutions, leading to the coexistence of these two distinct hairy phases in different regions of the parameter space. The phase diagram reveals a first-order phase transition line between the tachyonic-hairy and scalar-hairy phases, originating at a critical point in the extreme temperature and chemical potential regime. Our detailed analysis shows that this phase transition is directly associated with the self-overlap region of the scalar-hairy phase and its start point.

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data.

The background spacetime is assumed to be a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. Within this framework, we explicitly construct nonlinear long-wavelength solutions for cosmological perturbations. Since multi-fluid systems are inherently non-adiabatic, these solutions admit both adiabatic and entropy modes already at leading nonlinear order. We define adiabatic and entropy perturbations and discuss the non-uniqueness in defining pure entropy perturbations. Using different choices of pure entropy initial conditions, we analyze the time evolution of physical quantities such as the curvature perturbation and density perturbations in the geodesic slicing for two-fluid systems."}

J. van Weeren"], "title": "Lossless compression of simulated radio interferometric visibilities", "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 8 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Context. Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm."}

In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector."}

After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide."}

We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\\ell\\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-δ})$, $k=O(r^{-2-δ})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong."}

The deformation parameter $η$ allows the spin parameter to extend beyond the bounds imposed by the standard Kerr black hole. The results indicate that the polarized images depend not only on the magnetic field configuration, fluid velocity, and observer inclination angle, but also on the deformation parameter and the spin parameter. As the deformation parameter increases, the polarization intensity decreases monotonically when the magnetic field lies in the equatorial plane, whereas it does not vary monotonically when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The variation of the electric vector position angle with the deformation parameter is complex. For a fixed deformation parameter, the polarization intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the spin parameter and varies with azimuthal angle.

We show that the microstructure is characterized by a discrete topological index, which encodes both horizon structure and thermodynamic stability. Non extremal Kerr Newman black holes with both inner and outer horizons correspond to a vanishing topological index, while single horizon configurations correspond to a positive unit topological index. An explicit Starobinsky type modified gravity model demonstrates that this classification is robust under changes to the gravitational sector.

If either of these arguments holds, the first detection of continuous gravitational waves is likely with near future upgrades of current detectors, and many detections are likely with next generation detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. A lack of detections in the next several years would begin to raise serious doubts about current theories of millisecond pulsar formation."}

The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes."}

We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $ξ$ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $ξ$ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $ξ$ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $Ω$, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $ξ$ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% Ω$ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH."}

To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved."}

We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase. The singular structure of the RG flows has persisted on including gravitational-couplings, thereby offering further support to the conjecture that \\cPT -symmetric phases of (repulsive) gravity characterise string-effective CS gravitational theories, where the axion is the massless string-model independent axion, which can also play a role of a totally-antisymmetric torsion degree of freedom. This has suggested a novel interpretation of the currently observed acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in terms of such a phase at large (cosmological) scales."}

By recasting the radial Teukolsky equation into a Schrödinger-type form with a short-range potential, we derive WKB connection formulas that relate Kerr quasinormal frequencies to grey-body transmission coefficients. Higher-order WKB corrections are included, extending the correspondence beyond the leading eikonal regime. For gravitational perturbations, the predicted grey-body factors agree with numerical results obtained from the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura equation, with increasing accuracy at large angular quantum number. The correspondence breaks down in the superradiant regime, where the WKB assumptions fail."}

Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $α$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $α$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $α$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds."}

Then, we derive geodesic equations by using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. The radial photon orbital equation on equatorial plane and effective potential are analyzed. The total deflection angle and trajectories of photon as a function of impact parameter $b$ are plotted with the variation of $λ,D$ and $P$. Furthermore, the relation between photon ring's width and the Lyapunov exponent is also explored. In addition, we use the Gralla-Lupsasca-Marrone (GLM) model to model intensity profile of optically thin accretion disk around the object.

In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band."}

As a result, we explicitly demonstrate that the specific redshift transition occurs, namely, there happens a phase shift in the evolution of the universe from the initial deceleration era to the current accelerating phase of the cosmological scenario.

We then turn to the case where self-accelerating cosmology is driven by $K(X)$, finding that the time-dependence of the scalar field opens up the parameter space, turning the black-hole scalar charge from secondary to primary. We provide a stability analysis and a measure of the intensity of the kinetic screening from the quartic dispersion relation of the mixed scalar and gravitational modes."}

Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system."}
