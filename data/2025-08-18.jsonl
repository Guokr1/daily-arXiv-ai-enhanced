Four events\nmet these criteria: KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, OGLE-2024-BLG-0142,\nand KMT-2024-BLG-1309. We estimated the angular Einstein radius by combining\nthe normalized source radius measured from modeling the resolved caustic spikes\nwith the angular source radius derived from the source color and magnitude.\nAdditionally, we determined the microlens parallax through light curve\nmodeling, considering higher-order effects caused by the orbital motions of\nEarth and the binary lens. With measurements of the event timescale, angular\nEinstein radius, and microlens parallax, we uniquely determined the mass and\ndistance of the lens. For the events KMT-2022-BLG-1479, KMT-2023-BLG-0932, and\nKMT-2024-BLG-1309, both components of the binary lens have masses lower than\nthat of the Sun, consistent with M-type dwarfs, which are the most common type\nof lenses in Galactic microlensing events. These lenses are relatively nearby,\nwith distances $\\lesssim 2.5$ kpc, indicating their location within the\nGalactic disk. In contrast, for OGLE-2024-BLG-0142, the primary lens component\nhas a mass similar to that of the Sun, while the companion lens component has\nabout half the mass of the primary.

In this regard, there is a great\npossibility that dark energy can interact with the compact stellar matter\nconfiguration [Phys. Rev. D 103, 084042 (2021)]. In this article, we introduce\na physically viable model for celestial compact stars made of isotropic\nbaryonic matter and isotropic dark energy with Heintzmann's ansatz [Zeitschrift\nf\\\"ur Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)] in the context of Einstein's gravity.

The main focus of the present article is to see the effects of\ndark energy on the physical properties of the stars. We perform an in-depth\nanalysis of the physical attributes of the model, such as metric function,\ndensity, pressure, mass-radius relation, compactness parameter, gravitational\nand surface redshifts, along with the energy conditions for three well-known\ncompact stars. We analyse the equilibrium of the present model via the\ngeneralised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the stability with the help\nof the adiabatic index and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov's static stability\ncondition.

We demonstrate that the initial\nconditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency\nof the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest.\nAlthough in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the\nlaser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density\ndecreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral\ndensity shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser\npower is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation\npressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the\nclassical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme.\nSince the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a\nclassical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium\npoint of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must\nconsider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in\nequilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is\nincomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this\nincompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror\ndisplacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover\nthe near ideal case."}

The anholonomic frame and connection\ndeformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions\ndescribed by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on\nall spacetime coordinates.

Within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, it is conventional to\ninclude a term to account for power loss due to this window in the likelihood\nfunction. We show that the inclusion of this factor leads to biased inference.\nThe simplest solution to this, omitting the factor, leads to unbiased\nposteriors and Bayes factor estimates provided the window does not suppress the\nsignal for signal-to-noise ratios $\\lesssim O(100)$, but unreliable estimates\nof the absolute likelihood. Instead, we propose a multi-stage method that\nyields consistent estimates for the absolute likelihood in addition to unbiased\nposterior distributions and Bayes factors for signal-to-noise ratios $\\lesssim\nO(1000)$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the commonly held wisdom that using\nrectangular windows necessarily leads to biased inference is incorrect."}

We derive the effective potential governing massless scalar\nfields and compute the corresponding quasinormal mode spectra using three\nindependent methods: sixth-order WKB, P\\\"oschl-Teller and time-domain\nevolution. Our results show that symmetric black bounce configurations with\nhorizons yield a standard single-barrier potential, while horizonless solutions\nmay exhibit multiple potential barriers that generate gravitational wave\nechoes. These echoes are sensitive to model parameters such as the fluid energy\ndensity and the regularizing parameter $a$ that defines the minimal $2$-sphere.\nThe asymmetric models considered recover the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution in\ntheir external region but can be bounded or unbounded in the inside, depending\non the sign of a parameter. Both cases have similar qualitative properties as\nfar as wave emission is concerned but show no echoes. This makes it very\ndifficult to distinguish them from standard Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nconfigurations."}

We demonstrate that the initial\nconditions of the mirrors' motion concentrate around the fundamental frequency\nof the pendulum and are not related to the frequency range of our interest.\nAlthough in the ideal case, there is a consensus that the shot noise for the\nlaser in the high-frequency range in the signal-referred noise spectral density\ndecreases if the injected laser power is increased, our obtained noise spectral\ndensity shows that the shot noise does not decrease even if the injected laser\npower is increased. This is due to the leakage of the classical radiation\npressure forces from the classical carrier field to the output port, and the\nclassical carrier field is used as the reference in the DC readout scheme.\nSince the classical radiation pressure forces affect the mirror motion as a\nclassical constant force, this classical constant force changes the equilibrium\npoint of the pendulum of mirrors' motion. To recover the ideal case, we must\nconsider adjusting the interferometer's tuning point to place the mirrors in\nequilibrium points. We investigate the case where the equilibrium tuning is\nincomplete and show that the behavior of the above shot noise is due to this\nincompleteness. We also discuss the maximal deviation of the mirror\ndisplacements from the equilibrium point in the incomplete tuning to recover\nthe near ideal case."}

Speedmeter\nconfigurations, which measure mirror velocity rather than position, have been\nproposed as a means to suppress quantum back-action noise, but practical\nimplementations remain at an early stage. In this work, we present a table-top\nrealisation of the Einstein- Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Speedmeter concept, employing\nan optical readout scheme based on two orthogonal polarisation modes that probe\nthe interferometer with different effective bandwidths. Using a triangular\ncavity, we demonstrate that the differential optical response between the\nlinear p- and s-polarised modes exhibits a speed-like frequency dependence:\nvanishing at DC and increasing linearly with signal frequency, up to the\nbandwidth of the slower mode. With this we show that an optical system\nequivalent to the EPR Speedmeter indeed performs a velocity readout of the end\nmirror."}
