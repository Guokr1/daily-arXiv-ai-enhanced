First of\nall, the field equations governing a static spherical geometry associated with\nthe anisotropic fluid are formulated. The mass function corresponding to the\nconsidered geometry is defined in terms of both matter and geometric\nquantities. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor is then\nperformed through which a family of scalar quantities, known as structure\nscalars, is obtained. Using the Herrera's recent definition, one of the scalars\namong them is claimed as the complexity factor, \\emph{i.e.},\n$\\mathcal{Y}_{TF}$. Since there are extra degrees of freedom in the\ngravitational equations, some constraints are needed to make their solution\npossible to obtain. In this regard, a well-known vanishing complexity condition\nis introduced along with three different constraints which ultimately lead to\ndistinct stellar models. In order to check their physical feasibility, a\ndetailed graphical interpretation is provided using multiple values of the\nRastall parameter. It is concluded that the obtained results in all three cases\nare consistent with those of general relativity. Further, the Rastall theory\nprovides more suitable results in the case of model 2, indicating its\nsuperiority over Einstein's gravity theory."}

This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave\nequation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result\nof our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of\nthe black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed\nby an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to\na quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the\nstring at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The\nangular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent\nHeun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the\nwave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the\nstretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole\ncomplementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the\ntrapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can\nemit black-body radiation.
