Five oxidizing\nenvironments at atmospheric pressure are investigated: air, pure oxygen, and\nmixtures containing 40% oxygen (by mole) diluted with nitrogen, helium, or\nargon. The burning droplet peak temperature, measured by three-colour\npyrometry, increases by 337 K from air to pure oxygen. The peak temperature of\nthe silicon droplet in the 40%O2-60%He mixture is lower than that in the\n40%O2-60%Ar mixture, in contradiction with thermodynamic predictions, due to a\nhigher Lewis number of the helium-diluted mixture. Although oxygen diffusivity\nis higher in the helium-diluted mixture, a lower burning rate is observed,\nattributed to the lower combustion temperature. High-speed colour camera\nobservations reveal that the square of the particle diameter decreases with\ntime in each combustion run, following a strong linear relationship (R2 > 0.99)\nacross all oxidizing environments. However, the combustion lifetime is\nproportional to the initial particle diameter to the power of n, with n ranging\nfrom 1.69 to 1.82. This deviation from the expected n = 2 appears to result\nfrom unavoidable measurement uncertainties and the limited particle size range,\nrather than differences in combustion physics.

While the\nemergence of such instability is attributed to the non-Hermitian nature of the\ngravitational system, it remains sensitive to various factors. About the\nspatial scale of the metric deformation, spectral instability is particularly\nsusceptible to ``ultraviolet'' metric perturbations. In this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of black hole spectral instability triggered by random\nand deterministic metric perturbations. We investigate the dependence on the\nmagnitude, spatial scale, and localization of the metric perturbations in the\nP\\\"oschl-Teller effective potential, and discuss the underlying physical\ninterpretations. It is observed that small metric perturbations initially have\na limited impact on the less damped black hole quasinormal modes, and\ndeviations typically around their unperturbed values, a phenomenon first\nderived by Skakala and Visser in a more restrictive context. In the higher\novertone region, the deformation propagates, amplifies, and eventually gives\nrise to spectral instability and, inclusively, bifurcation in the quasinormal\nmode spectrum. While deterministic metric perturbations give rise to a deformed\nbut well-defined quasinormal spectrum, random perturbations lead to\nuncertainties in the resulting spectrum. Nonetheless, the primary trend of the\nspectral instability remains consistent, being sensitive to both the strength\nand location of the perturbation.

In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a\ncanonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon\nradius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is\ndefined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius\ntreated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond\nto the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free\nenergy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an\nassociated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of\nblack hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which\nis independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the\nFokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by\nconsidering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale\nwith black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can\nbe used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black\nhole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes\nunder a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy\nbecome extremal at the same horizon radius.
