We derive\ngravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data\nto constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early\nUniverse: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff\nequation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations,\nprimordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the\npresence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and\nneutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered.\nWe address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics\nmodels based on the obtained parameter constraints.

In\nthis study, we revisit the classical theory and propose an improved analytic\nexpression of photocurrent by applying more accurate boundary conditions. Our\nimproved expression reveals that the photocurrent comprises of two components:\nthe conventional photocurrent and a previously unrecognized backward\nphotocurrent. Latter reduces the total photocurrent, yet it has not been\ndiscussed in prior literature. The essential role of the built-in potential is\nto suppress this backward current. Furthermore, our improved expression of\nphotocurrent predicts that the photocurrent vanishes under certain forward bias\nconditions. This prediction is experimentally validated using a commercial\nsilicon solar cell, confirming the direct impact of the built-in potential on\nphotocurrent behavior."}

Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical\nintegration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to\ninaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel\nmethodology for constructing Poincar\\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional\nConnections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous\nand differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy\nprescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\\'e maps is formulated as\neither an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For\nIVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection\ntime with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear\nconvergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation\nwithout resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs,\nperiodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body\nProblem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to\nconstruct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to\nnon-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body\nProblem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest\ncomputational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or\niterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate\nthat TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing\nPoincar\\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical\nsystems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts."}

It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam\nstack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of\n2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of\nfaces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing\nthe amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area\nof internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an\nintegral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.\nThis manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the\nunderlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics\nfrom a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF\ntheory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a\npowerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a\ntriangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends\nonly on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result\nthat is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This\nprovides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined\nlimit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of\nquantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism."}

Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates,\nthe perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime\nis analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics.\nTherefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing\nwave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to\nshow the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples.\nOn the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces\nback and forth within this potential well.
