These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials."}

Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.\n  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.\n  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.\n  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters."}

However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection. We discuss implications for broadening SETI methodologies, leveraging the diverse forms of intelligence found on Earth."}

A Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation (with no physical time interpretation) is introduced to drive the metric perturbation toward fixed points sustained by chiral sources while keeping curvature invariants negligible. We show that divergence-free chiral currents can support globally non-trivial torsional holonomy stabilized by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups pi1(S1) and pi3(S3). Toroidal skyrmionic domains emerge when one chirality dominates, whereas a chiral-flip interference sector enables Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions. In the static limit, a Green-function formulation provides a finite-range Yukawa-type response governed by the neutrino coherence length. These results identify a purely torsional mechanism, independent of local curvature, through which coherent chiral currents may influence effective gravitational behavior in neutrino-rich environments."}

The gain reach under stable operation is found to be considerably lower in the other two sectors. The gas gain shows a characteristic time-dependence as it rises quickly in the first hour of operation and then drops slowly over the next 24 hours and subsequently stabilizes."}

It aims to explore and study high-energy cosmic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals. The structure, technical design, implementation, and performance of the FOCS system are also described in detail. We conclude with a summary of the current status of the FOCS system and our near-future development plan."}

We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant αbehaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \\(α_{eff(E)}/α\\approx 1 - \\frac{E}{4E_p}\\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied.

This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset. This approach can be used to improve the processing efficiency for the SMART and is also relevant for future SKA pulsar surveys."}

Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies.

We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + η_1 Q_0\\left(1 - e^{-η_2 \\sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $η_1$, $η_2$, $H_0$, and $Ω_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $μ(z)$ show strong consistency with $Λ$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied. Cosmic age estimates from the model are consistently in agreement with Planck constraints. Our results indicate the viability of exponential $f(Q)$ gravity. A comparative statistical analysis reveals that while $Λ$CDM remains statistically preferred based on AIC and BIC criteria, the exponential $f(Q)$ model yields comparable fits and remains a theoretically motivated and viable alternative for describing cosmic acceleration."}

According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $Λ$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results."}

The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane.

Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers).

The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a \"D\" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel \"duck-cap-like\" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the \"extended inner shadow\", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission. Such deviations from Kerr predictions could be tested by future high-precision astronomical observations, potentially offering new evidence for the existence of NUT charge (or the gravitomagnetic monopole) in black holes."}

Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD & CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity.

This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis."}

We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds."}

This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts."}
