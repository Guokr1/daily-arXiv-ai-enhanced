To advance this research,\ncountries have made significant investments in constructing large low-frequency\nradio telescope arrays, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Square\nKilometre Array Phase 1 Low Frequency (SKA1-low). These instruments are pivotal\nfor radio astronomy research. However, challenges such as ionospheric plasma\ninterference, ambient radio noise, and instrument-related effects have become\nincreasingly prominent, posing major obstacles in cosmology research. To\naddress these issues, this paper proposes an efficient signal processing method\nthat combines wavelet transform and mathematical morphology. The method\ninvolves the following steps: Background Subtraction: Background interference\nin radio observation signals is eliminated. Wavelet Transform: The signal,\nafter removing background noise, undergoes a two-dimensional discrete wavelet\ntransform. Threshold processing is then applied to the wavelet coefficients to\neffectively remove interference components. Wavelet Inversion: The processed\nsignal is reconstructed using wavelet inversion. Mathematical Morphology: The\nreconstructed signal is further optimized using mathematical morphology to\nrefine the results. Experimental verification was conducted using solar\nobservation data from the Xinjiang Observatory and the Yunnan Observatory. The\nresults demonstrate that this method successfully removes interference signals\nwhile preserving useful signals, thus improving the accuracy of radio astronomy\nobservations and reducing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI)."}

Methods have been developed to measure\nupper atmospheric seeing based on models of the turbulence in the atmosphere,\nbut due to boundary conditions, transmission within telescope enclosures is\nmore complex. The Multi-beam Optical Seeing Sensor (MOSS) directly measures the\ncomponent of the image quality degradation from inhomogeneity of the index of\nrefraction within the telescope dome. MOSS outputs four near-parallel beams of\nlight that travel along the optical path and are imaged by the telescope's\ndetector, landing like starlight on the telescope's focal plane. By using a\nstrobed light source, we can 'freeze' the instantaneous index variations\ntransverse to the optical path. This system captures both 'dome' and 'mirror'\nseeing. Through plotting the standard deviation of differential motion between\npairs of beams, MOSS enables characterization of the length scale of turbulence\nwithin the dome. The temporal coherence of temperature gradients can be probed\nwith different pulse lengths, and the spatial coherence by comparing pairs at\ndifferent separations across the aperture of the telescope.

The results\ndemonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO\nradius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the\nthermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking\ntemperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The\ninfluence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces\nsubstantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in\nphase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric\neffects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field\nperturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon\nequation and reducing it to a Schr\\\"odinger-like form via separation of\nvariables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail,\nhighlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the\nquintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC\ngeometry setting."}
