One important metric for any single-photon detector\nis the deadtime (or recovery time), defined as the minimum temporal separation\nbetween consecutive detection events. In SNSPDs, the recovery time is more\nsubtle, as the detection efficiency does not abruptly drop to zero when the\ntemporal separation between detection events gets smaller, instead, it\nincreases gradually as the SNSPD current recovers. SNSPD's recovery time is\ndominated by its kinetic inductance, the readout impedance, and the degree of\nsaturation of internal efficiency. Decreasing the kinetic inductance or\nincreasing the readout impedance can accelerate the recovery process.\nSignificant reduction of the SNSPD recovery time, by, for example, adding a\nseries resistor in the readout circuitry, is possible but can lead to detector\nlatching which hinders further detector operation or enforces underbiasing and\nhence a reduction in detection efficiency. Previous research has demonstrated\npassive resistive networks for the reduction of recovery time that rely on\ntrial and error to find the appropriate resistance values. Here we show, using\na novel, cryogenically compatible, and tunable resistor technology, one can\nfind the optimized impedance values, delivering fast SNSPD recovery time, while\nmaintaining maximum internal detection efficiency. Here we show an increase of\nmore than 2 folds in both maximum achievable detection rates and the achievable\ndetection efficiency at high photon fluxes, demonstrating detection rates as\nhigh as 120 Mcps with no loss of internal detection efficiency."}

In this work, we propose an optical detection system for\na spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on the inverse weak\nmeasurement (IWM) framework. By using the spatial pattern of a probe laser as\nthe measurement pointer, we successfully detect ultra-weak magnetic fields. In\nour model, the spatial pattern of the probe laser is weakly coupled to its\npolarization, which is sensitive to external magnetic fields. Through\npost-selection on the optical polarization, the ultra-small magnetic field is\nsignificantly amplified with the amplification factor inversely proportional to\nthe coupling strength, as reflected in the measured displacement of the final\nspatial pattern. By analysing the response curve of the probe laser\ndisplacement to the magnetic field, we identify the point of maximum\nsensitivity, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity of 182.8 fT/Hz1/2.\nFurthermore, in the IWM scheme, the detected signals depend only on the\ninternal degrees of freedom of the probe laser, making the system robust\nagainst the fluctuations in laser power. To demonstrate this advantage, we\ncompute the Allan standard deviation of the output signals for both\nconventional and IWM detection methods.

While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between\nthe detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which\nare sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the\ncontext of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general\nframework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic\ndetector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a\ngeneric static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral\nexpression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct\nspacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we\ndemonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the\nprecise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon.\nFor a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the\nradiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct\ncorrespondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with\nthe modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative\ncoupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal\ncoupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive\nprobe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide\ndistinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and\nalternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime."}

Further optimisation and\nimproved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this\nin the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an\n8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep\nimaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\\mu$Jy/beam.

By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to\ninclude both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total\nenergy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum\nspacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that\nthe standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr\\\"odinger,\nKlein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The\nsolutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without\nassuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is\nalso implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the\nidea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and\nconstraints."}

Comment on arXiv:2109.03174", "summary": "In the work [Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 2, 024042], D'Ambrosio et al. investigated\nspherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where\nseveral solutions satisfy the condition: $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \\mathrm{const}$. This\ncondition is characteristic of many black holes, including the Schwarzschild\nspacetime. In this Comment, we argue that no nontrivial vacuum black hole\nsolutions satisfy this condition in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. We demonstrate our\nclaim by reexamining the field equations under the \"Set 2\" connection called by\nD'Ambrosio et al., which is necessary for obtaining solutions distinct from\nthose of general relativity (GR). For the case where the free parameters $c$\nand $k$ are zero, i.e., Option 2 in their work, we show that any attempt to\nfind a solution beyond GR forces the non-metricity scalar to vanish\n($\\mathbb{Q}=0$), which trivializes the field equations and does not describe a\nvalid black hole solution. Our findings indicate that the condition,\n$g_{tt}g_{rr} = \\mathrm{const.}$, is overly restrictive for finding new, static\nand spherically symmetric vacuum black holes in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This\nconclusion does not depend on the specific form of $f(\\mathbb{Q})$. We also\nbriefly discuss Option 1 that was not addressed in D'Ambrosio et al.'s work,\nand give new constraints for the selection of parameters $c$ and $k$."}

The\nquasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations are computed numerically using\nthe continued fraction method. Particularly, we analyze the scalar, vector, and\ntensor types of perturbations, noting that the tensor type only exists in\nspacetimes with more than four dimensions. The grey-body factors are then\ncalculated analytically via the correspondence, using data from the fundamental\nquasinormal mode and the first overtone. We then compute the grey-body factors\nindependently using a numerical method and find that the results from the two\nmethods coincide. This demonstrates that the correspondence holds with high\naccuracy for all three types of gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, our\nresults extend the validity of the correspondence to the tensor type, which can\nonly be tested in spacetimes with more than four dimensions."}

Thermodynamic consistency dictates the treatment of\nthe gravitational field as a thermodynamic variable. We introduce the\nthermodynamic conjugate to the gravitational field, the gravitational pull, an\nadditive variable that is a structural element of our microcanonical\ndistribution.

In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise\nin a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet\nhair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in\nsuch a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes\nwithout invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics.\nUsing both the higher-order WKB method with Pad\\'e resummation and time-domain\nintegration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test\nfields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel\nmechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the\nringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity."}
