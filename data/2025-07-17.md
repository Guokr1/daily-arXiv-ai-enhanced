TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SAMPLE的气球载具，用于从平流层收集尘埃样本以研究微生物生存极限，为天体生物学提供新数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平流层环境与火星表面相似，但微生物生存上限尚不明确，且该区域因难以访问和避免污染而未被充分研究。

Method: 开发了SAMPLE系统，包括预灭菌采样托盘、控制器、环境传感器等，通过气球收集样本并返回实验室分析。

Result: 系统设计新颖，优化了重量和应力，包含控制和监测机制以确保样本质量。

Conclusion: SAMPLE为探索地球生物圈上限和天体生物学提供了新工具，有望填补研究空白。

Abstract: The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on
extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely
resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation
levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the
troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere
remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore
microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to
astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in
access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE
(Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne
payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them
in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and
designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main
payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that
determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed
during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control)
to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS
trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once
sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload.
Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be
sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the
presence and nature of collected material.

Abstract: This white paper highlights the work that is needed to anticipate the
challenges and societal impacts of a possible technosignature detection. We
recommend practical steps to strengthen NASA's astrobiology agenda, guided by
the existing interdisciplinary framework of the SETI PostDetection Hub (est.
2022) at the University of St Andrews (Elliot et al. 2023), which emphasizes
comprehensive preparedness across science, society, governance, and
communication. NASA can significantly enhance readiness by supporting deep
interdisciplinary integration, funding SETI post-detection research
infrastructure, and cultivating international collaboration. We outline six key
dimensions of readiness-directed evidence-based research: cross-divisional
methodologies, humanities and social sciences integration, communication,
strategic foresight, and development of resilient global infrastructures.

TL;DR: 地面天文观测受大气湍流影响，但通过系统误差处理和KMTNet多时期数据，可实现亚毫角秒精度，用于探测银河系黑洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流限制了地面天文观测的精度，但通过改进方法，可以利用现有设备实现更高精度，支持黑洞探测。

Method: 采用类似Gaia的AGIS方法，结合去趋势步骤，处理KMTNet的6,500张图像数据。

Result: 在亮星（星等<17）中，五年基线内相对自行运动精度达0.1-0.2 mas/yr。

Conclusion: 通过改进方法，KMTNet的观测数据可用于高精度天体测量，支持黑洞探测。

Abstract: The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based
astrometry. Here we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper
treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the
Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can
reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for
the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our
methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using
seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric
Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that include several detrending steps. Tests
on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing
condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can
achieve, at the bright end (mag <17), relative proper motion precision of
0.1-0.2 mas/yr, over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from
the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. The precision is
estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing
results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Pierre Auger Observatory利用高时间分辨率研究ELVES，并扩展观测范围至HALOS等光瞬变现象。2023-2024年安装TLECAMs相机，首次实现SPRITES和ELVES的同时观测，并开发基于DBSCAN的Python算法自动检测SPRITES。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究电离层底部光瞬变现象（如ELVES、HALOS、SPRITES），扩展观测能力并提高数据采集效率。

Method: 使用Fluorescence Detector (FD)和新增的TLECAMs相机进行高分辨率观测，开发基于DBSCAN的Python算法自动检测SPRITES。

Result: 首次实现SPRITES和ELVES的同时观测，并成功应用自动检测算法。

Conclusion: 新增设备和算法显著提升了光瞬变现象的观测效率和数据质量。

Abstract: Since 2014, the Pierre Auger Observatory has exploited a dedicated trigger
and its very high time resolution to study ELVES and harvest record samples of
multiple ELVES using the Fluorescence Detector (FD). In 2017, after extending
the readout of trace lengths to 0.9 ms, we started observing other types of
light transients from the base of the ionosphere, such as HALOS, which deserved
further investigation. In December 2023 and April 2024, we installed two
additional cameras (TLECAMs), which allow us to perform simultaneous detection
of these transients with higher space resolution and longer integration times.
Here, we present our first simultaneous observations of SPRITES and ELVES by
both TLECAMs and FD. Furthermore, we describe the Python algorithm based on
DBSCAN to automatically detect SPRITES in the videos recorded by our TLECAMs
and acquire data efficiently without needing the FD trigger.

Abstract: We explore the use of Swin Transformer V2, a pre-trained vision Transformer,
for photometric classification in a multi-survey setting by leveraging light
curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid
Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We evaluate different strategies
for integrating data from these surveys and find that a multi-survey
architecture which processes them jointly achieves the best performance. These
results highlight the importance of modeling survey-specific characteristics
and cross-survey interactions, and provide guidance for building scalable
classifiers for future time-domain astronomy.

### [6] [The Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC): A nulling coronagraph for use on primary objective grating telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11745)
*Leaf Swordy,Heidi Jo Newberg,Becket Hill,Richard K. Barry,Marina Cousins,Kerrigan Nish,Frank Ravizza,Sarah Rickborn*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: DLC是一种新型的AIC变体，专为具有大色散主光栅的光学系统设计，用于高分辨率近地系外行星探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为DICER望远镜设计一种能够有效消除轴上目标光、实现高分辨率成像的日冕仪。

Method: 开发DLC的理论基础，分析其焦点平面传输图、恒星泄漏、残余光程差容忍度及指向误差。

Result: DLC能有效消除轴上目标光，实现2D/λ衍射极限成像，并可能发现约4颗宜居系外行星。

Conclusion: DLC适用于需要极高分辨率和近距离伴星光谱的应用。

Abstract: We present the Dispersion Leverage Coronagraph (DLC), a novel variation of
the Achromatic Interfero Coronagraph (AIC) that is designed for optical systems
featuring large, dispersive primary objective gratings. DLC was originally
designed for the Diffractive Interfero Coronagraph Exoplanet Resolver (DICER),
a notional 20m class infrared space telescope utilizing the enhanced
one-dimensional angular resolution of large diffraction gratings in order to
discover and characterize near-Earth exoplanets. Here we develop the
theoretical foundation for DLC, and apply it to DICER as an example use case.
We derive important properties of the DLC system including focal plane
transmission maps, stellar leakage, residual optical path difference tolerance,
and pointing error/jitter considerations. Ultimately, we found that DLC
effectively nulls an on-axis target across the entire spectrum in the focal
plane, allowing for 2D/lambda diffraction-limited imaging. It requires
asymmetrical fine-guidance tolerances on pointing error/jitter. We work through
a benchmark DICER design, explaining the need for a second disperser to reduce
background from Zodiacal light, and showing that it could plausibly find and
characterize approximately 4 nearby, habitable exoplanets around Sun-like stars
in a seven year mission; about 30% of the habitable exoplanets within 8 pc were
found in our simulation. The DLC may be useful for any application requiring
extremely high resolution, close-companion spectroscopy.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度神经网络的方法，从单次曝光光谱中提取双线光谱双星（SB2s）的恒星参数，无需解缠光谱或提取径向速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型巡天项目（如Gaia或LAMOST）中因观测次数不足而难以解缠SB2光谱的挑战。

Method: 使用深度神经网络直接从单次曝光光谱中提取SB2的恒星参数，基于模拟的Gaia RVS光谱数据进行训练和验证。

Result: 工具能够有效提取SB2的恒星参数，适用于未来Gaia数据发布的分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为SB2的光谱分析提供了一种高效且无需多阶段观测的解决方案。

Abstract: Distinguishing the component spectra of double-line spectroscopic binaries
(SB2s) and extracting their stellar parameters is a complex and computationally
intensive task that usually requires observations spanning several epochs that
represent various orbital phases. This poses an especially significant
challenge for large surveys such as Gaia or LAMOST, where the number of
available spectra per target is often not enough for a proper spectral
disentangling. We present a new approach for characterizing SB2 components from
single-exposure spectroscopic observations. The proposed tool uses deep neural
networks to extract the stellar parameters of the individual component spectra
that comprise the single exposure, without explicitly disentangling them or
extracting their radial velocities. The neural networks were trained, tested,
and validated using simulated data resembling Gaia RVS spectra, which will be
made available to the community in the coming Gaia data releases. We expect our
tool to be useful in their analysis.

Motivation: 解决材料开发中宏观性能与微观特性关联的挑战，避免材料开发的盲目性。

Method: 使用神经网络从光电流-电压曲线中提取电荷载流子迁移率和陷阱态密度等参数，并采用非高斯似然分布评估参数置信度。

Result: 在PM6:Y12和降解的PM6:BTP-eC9有机太阳能电池上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为材料开发提供了高效且可靠的参数提取工具，适用于资源有限的实验室。

Abstract: A key challenge in the development of materials for the next generation of
solar cells, sensors and transistors is linking macroscopic device performance
to underlying microscopic properties. For years, fabrication of devices has
been faster than our ability to characterize them. This has led to a random
walk of material development, with new materials being proposed faster than our
understanding. We present two neural network-based methods for extracting key
material parameters, including charge carrier mobility and trap state density,
in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells. Our methods require solely
measured light current--voltage curve and modest computational resources,
making our approach applicable in even minimally equipped laboratories. Unlike
traditional machine learning models, our methods place the final material
values in a non-Gaussian likelihood distribution, allowing confidence
assessment of each predicted parameter. We demonstrate these techniques using
fresh PM6:Y12 and degraded PM6:BTP-eC9 organic solar cells.

Motivation: 光化学（PEC）生物传感器在生物分子检测中具有高灵敏度和低背景噪声的优势，但其性能受限于光生载流子的快速复合。

Method: 研究创新性地引入非接触式磁调制策略，通过调控载流子自旋态抑制电子-空穴复合，并基于MXenes/钴掺杂二氧化钛异质结构开发了新型PEC生物传感平台。

Result: 该平台在检测蛋白激酶A（PKA）活性时，灵敏度提升了68.75%，检测限低至0.00016 U/mL，线性范围为0.005至80 U/mL。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅为激酶活性分析提供了新方法，还开创了磁调制增强PEC传感的创新策略，为高性能生物传感平台的开发开辟了新途径，有望用于早期疾病诊断和药物筛选。

Abstract: Photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors exhibit significant potential for
biomolecule detection due to their high sensitivity and low background noise.
However, their performance is severely constrained by the rapid recombination
of photogenerated charge carriers. This study innovatively introduces a
non-contact magnetic modulation strategy to suppress electron-hole
recombination by manipulating carrier spin states, thereby significantly
enhancing photoelectric conversion efficiency. Building on this mechanism, we
developed a novel magnetically modulated PEC biosensing platform based on the
MXenes/cobalt-doped titanium dioxide (Co-TiO2) heterostructure. This platform
achieved ultrasensitive detection of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Compared
to an identical probe-modified biosensor without magnetic field application,
the developed platform demonstrated a 68.75% enhancement in detection
sensitivity and achieved an ultralow detection limit for PKA of 0.00016 U/mL.
It also exhibited a wide linear range from 0.005 to 80 U/mL. This research not
only provides a novel methodology for kinase activity analysis but also
pioneers the innovative strategy of magnetic modulation for enhanced PEC
sensing. It opens new avenues for developing high-performance biosensing
platforms, holding significant promise for early disease diagnosis and drug
screening applications.

Conclusion: 极光电离层湍流是一个由外部驱动的自组织耗散结构系统。

Abstract: The auroral ionosphere presents a paradox: turbulence often thrives in a
conductive layer that should suppress the growth rates of plasma instabilities.
Using a novel composite power spectrum from coherent radar and GPS data, we
show that turbulence on a wide range of scales stem not from local
instabilities. Instead, its spectrum is a structural imprint of field-aligned
electrical currents, and its dissipative character is governed by the flux of
precipitating particles. Our measurements provide a clear geophysical example
of a driven, emergent system of self-organized dissipative structures.

Motivation: 解决太阳风安静期间超热离子的起源、加速和各向异性等未解问题。

Method: 利用Aditya L1上的STEPS传感器测量安静期间超热离子的能谱指数，并结合ACE上的ULEIS数据分析了元素丰度比。

Result: 发现超热离子分布是各向同性的（能谱指数约为2.0），并可能来源于之前的太阳耀斑和CME事件。

Conclusion: 安静期间超热离子的各向同性分布及其来源可能与历史太阳活动事件有关。

Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the
interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood
issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral
indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the
four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and
Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle
EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS
sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one
plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North
Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by
the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV
and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during
January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential
directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all
directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their
distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O,
and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy
Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the
previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time
suprathermal ion pool.

Abstract: State-of-the art neutron spectrometers enable simultaneous measurements of
high-dimensional datasets, allowing for a large collection rate of dynamic
material properties. In this paper, we present the Algorithm for Multiplexing
spectrometer Background Estimation with Rotation-independence (AMBER), which is
a segmentation algorithm designed to decompose measured neutron scattering data
into model-agnostic foreground and background contributions. The method takes
advantage of the fact that background and foreground signals are measured
simultaneously during the data collection process, relying on rotational
independence of background contributions. The algorithm, initially developed
for multiplexing neutron spectrometers, aims to strongly reduce time consuming
expert input, therefore promoting full data set usage while minimizing the
source of systematic errors.

Conclusion: ThF$_4$薄膜适合用于$^{229m}$Th的直接测量和核钟研究。

Abstract: We conducted measurements on the photo- and radio-luminescence of thin
ThF$_4$ films in both the UV and visible ranges. In the UV range, we found that
both luminescences are at a similar level as the internal dark counting noise
of the photo-multiplier-tube (PMT). Our results suggest that thin ThF$_4$
crystals could be used as a target for the search for $^{229m}$Th and as a
medium for the future nuclear clock. The measurements indicate that using a
small and thin ThF$_4$ film can reduce background noise while maintaining the
signal at the same level, achieved by increasing the $^{229}$Th enrichment. Our
developed apparatus is now ready for direct measurements of $^{229m}$Th
excitation and decay in ThF$_4$.

Abstract: Medical synchrotrons are often used for testing instrumentation in
high-energy physics or non-clinical research in medical physics. In many
applications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging,
precise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is
crucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical
settings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time,
making single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address
these limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide
(SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of
detecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse
duration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the
spill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation
room beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the
synchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity
at small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for
high-flux beam monitoring.

Motivation: 半导体先进封装的非破坏性测试因层深和复杂性增加而变得困难，现有方法（如FFT）未考虑涡流效应和图像不对齐，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: SPIM包含三个关键部分：1）通过I/Q通道图像对齐“锐利”线场信号以减少涡流效应；2）校正扫描SQUID显微镜的对齐偏差；3）结合毕奥-萨伐尔定律和FFT将磁场转换为电流密度。

Result: SPIM使I通道锐度提升0.3%，Q通道锐度降低25%，并成功校正了0.30的旋转和倾斜偏差。

Conclusion: SPIM展示了空间分析与物理驱动模型结合在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) is a promising material for radiation monitoring in
harsh environments, due to its low dark current, high breakdown voltage, high
thermal conductivity, and radiation hardness.~This work investigates a
SiC-based Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD), named SICAR, with a gain factor
of~2 to 3, under 80 MeV proton irradiation up to $1\times
10^{14}$~$n_{eq}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization via I-V, C-V, and
$\alpha$ particle injection reveals an increase in threshold voltage and a 2 to
4 order of magnitude reduction in leakage current, while charge collection
efficiency decreases by about 50\%. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and capacitance
deep-level transient spectroscopy (C-DLTS) were employed to characterize the
lattice structure and deep-level defects before and after irradiation.
Deep-level defect characteristics were integrated into TCAD simulations to
develop an electrical degradation model for SiC LGADs. A linear defect-flux
relationship is established in the model, showing agreement with experimental
results.

Conclusion: 大质量玻色子星的光学成像特性可通过参数调节，且与黑洞有明显区别。

Abstract: This study investigates the optical imaging characteristics of massive boson
stars based on a model with Einstein's nonlinear electrodynamics. Under
asymptotically flat boundary conditions, the field equations are solved
numerically to obtain the spacetime metric of the massive boson stars.
Employing the ray-tracing method, we analyze the optical images of the massive
boson stars under two illumination conditions: a celestial light source and a
thin accretion disk. The research reveals that the configurations and optical
images of the massive boson stars can be tuned via the initial parameter
$\phi_0$ and the coupling constant $\Lambda$. The absence of the event horizon
in the massive boson stars results in distinct optical image characteristics
compared to those of black holes.

Abstract: We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the
study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational
consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted
considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that
both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra
can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The
temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the
first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of
high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes.
We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes,
highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in
gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and
reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole
spacetimes are summarized.

Motivation: 研究Myrzakulov引力及其推广形式在早期宇宙描述中的潜力，探索其在不同时空几何形式下的预测能力。

Method: 在平坦FLRW背景下推导场方程，研究标量场驱动的膨胀解，计算标量谱指数和张量-标量比，并扩展到F(R,T)引力模型。

Conclusion: Myrzakulov引力及其推广形式为早期宇宙提供了一致且几何动机强的描述，具有跨时空几何形式的预测能力。

Abstract: We present a unified treatment of cosmic inflation within the framework of
Myrzakulov Gravity, exploring its realization in three different formalisms:
metric (curvature-based), teleparallel (torsion-based), and symmetric
teleparallel (non-metricity-based). For each case, we derive the corresponding
field equations in a flat FLRW background, study inflationary solutions driven
by a scalar field, and compute observable quantities such as the scalar
spectral index \( n_s \) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \( r \). In addition to
these geometric sectors, we extend our analysis to the more general and
dynamically richer Myrzakulov \( F(R,T) \) gravity, which incorporates both
curvature \( R \) and torsion \( T \) in a unified action. We derive the
inflationary dynamics in this hybrid model and investigate how it interpolates
between pure \( f(R) \) and \( f(T) \) behaviors. The resulting framework
allows for enhanced flexibility in matching Planck and BICEP/Keck observational
constraints. We present analytic estimates and schematic predictions in the \(
n_s \)--\( r \) plane, demonstrating that appropriately chosen parameters in \(
F(R,T) \) models can produce viable and distinguishable inflationary
signatures. This comparative and extended study highlights the potential of
Myrzakulov Gravity and its generalizations to provide a consistent and
geometrically motivated description of the early universe, with predictive
power across different formulations of spacetime geometry.

Method: 在Einstein-Straus-de Sitter框架下分析球对称质量分布的强引力透镜效应，应用于透镜类星体SDSS J1004+4112。

Result: 发现临界尺度因子约为2.6×10²⁷米，低于此值时负曲率效应显著；光偏转增加约1%，时间延迟增加约10%。

Conclusion: 负曲率在临界值以下增强透镜效应，但宇宙常数仍会减弱光偏转，支持Rindler和Ishak的结论。

Abstract: We analyze strong gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric mass
distribution within the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter framework in a spatially open
Universe with negative curvature ($k = -1$). Applying the theory to the lensed
quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we identify a critical threshold for the current scale
factor $a_0$ of approximately $2.6 \times 10^{27}$ m, below which the effects
of negative spatial curvature on lensing observables become significant,
corresponding to a current curvature density of $|\Omega_{k0}| \gtrsim 0.0025$.
In particular, for $\Omega_{k0} = -0.15$, the light bending increases slightly
by about 1%, while the time delay exhibits a more substantial increase of about
10%. Beyond this threshold, however, the lensing observables are found to be
insensitive to the current scale factor and converge to those characteristic of
a spatially flat Universe. Importantly, our results indicate that, even where
spatial curvature would otherwise enhance lensing observables, the effect of
the cosmological constant remains present and acts to reduce light bending,
corroborating the claim of Rindler and Ishak.

Abstract: Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the
``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the
cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as
quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work
investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized
by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework
of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form
of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological
scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for
the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter.
Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its
parameters and evaluate its consistency.

Result: 发现黑洞解存在强耦合问题，且在奇点附近出现幽灵和拉普拉斯不稳定性。

Conclusion: 具有ϕ'(r)=1/r标量场配置的平面黑洞在物理上不可行且不稳定。

Abstract: In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional
regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability
of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional
compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of
Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose
metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative
given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such
BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of
the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike
coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to
both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$.
Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular
planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable
and stable configurations.

Conclusion: Kerr-Taub-NUT黑洞的磁重联机制为GRS 1915+105的观测数据提供了新的解释途径。

Abstract: We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via
magnetic reconnections occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that
the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through
magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency,
which is opposite to those of the black hole spin and the magnetization
parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic
reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem on the observed jet power
and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed
black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection
with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this
mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can
simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS
1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.

Conclusion: 结果表明，高阶导数电动力学与低维引力背景的相互作用导致了温度修正，但黑洞的热力学性质仍保持合理。

Abstract: We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs)
in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative
extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing
a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and
second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the
Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike
in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole
solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation,
albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We
compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method,
demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp
Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are
marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic
behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the
interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional
gravitational background.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity
in a $D$-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe.
First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor
for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized
Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the
thermodynamic behavior of the apparent horizon and derive the equations of
state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon.
Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding
to phase transitions. We determine the critical temperature and critical radius
in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the
cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as
Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy.
By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the
thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find
that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new
thermodynamic behaviors compared to general relativity.

Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, based on the highly symmetric FLRW geometry,
has successfully explained a wide range of cosmological observations. However,
it faces unresolved issues, including CMB anomalies, the nature of dark matter,
and the matter-antimatter asymmetry. These challenges highlight the limitations
of the standard framework and raise questions about the validity of the assumed
isotropic background geometry. A natural direction is to explore more general
cosmological models that relax this assumption, potentially offering new
insights into these problems. In this work, we examine a geometric approach to
investigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond
the Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself. While related
questions have been raised previously in specific contexts, here we focus on
the Bianchi IX cosmological model, motivated by its relevance to early-universe
dynamics through the BKL conjecture and its potential role in generating
angular momentum via global rotation. We study the Dirac spinor field in this
background and derive the corresponding Dirac equation. Our goal is to
investigate how spatial anisotropies and rotation can induce spectral
asymmetries between particles and antiparticles. This paper lays the groundwork
for a follow-up study analyzing specific solutions and their physical
implications on matter-antimatter asymmetry.

Abstract: We consider the hypothetical possibility that non-stationary glitch features
in the noise of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors could be produced by
small dark matter clumps that pass through the earth in the vicinity of
gravitational-wave detectors. We first derive the gravitational-wave strain
that would be generated by the passage of such a dark matter clump. We find
that the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational
acceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of
the photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential
created by the dark matter clump. We also find that the Newtonian acceleration
effect dominates the gravitational-wave strain for both ground and space-based
interferometers. We then compare our dark matter clump, gravitational-wave
strain model to 84 Koi-Fish glitches detected during the second observing run
of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA collaboration through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
Bayesian analysis. We find that all glitches but 9 can be confidently rejected
as having originated from dark matter clumps. For the remaining glitches, the
dark matter hypothesis cannot be excluded, and the maximum \textit{a
posteriori} parameters yield minimum densities of about $10^{-7}
{\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^3$, within the model. These results allow us to place the
first direct upper limits with gravitational-wave detectors on the local
over-density of dark matter in the form of clumps in the local neighborhood of
Earth, namely $\rho_{{\rm DM} \, {\rm clumps}} \lesssim 10^{-15}
{\rm{g}}/{\rm{cm}}^{-3}$.

Abstract: We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from
the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a
and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW
signals targeted by this search are the so-called "long-duration" (> 1 s)
transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including
non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We
make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies
and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and
frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant
detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of
root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits
improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by
about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress
in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in
pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance
and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will
increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios
involving neutron stars and black holes.

Result: 方法在阻尼正弦波和SXS数值波形上验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决多QNM分析中的挑战提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The ringdown signal following a BH merger can be modeled as a superposition
of BH QNMs, offering a clean setup for testing gravitational theories. In
particular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their
frequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a
technique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional
QNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher
computational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient
Bayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs.
This reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic
marginalization over the mode amplitudes. We validate our approach using damped
sinusoids and numerical waveforms from the SXS catalog.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black
hole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method
introduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method
can give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have
also derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering
massive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the
charged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be
neglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the
accurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant
term, which can be derived from the standard definition.
