The logarithmic mass ratio\n$\\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent\nevolution of $\\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic, and CPL\nmodels indicating quasi-static accretion, steep slopes in JBP corresponding to\nrapid late-time variations, and non-monotonic behaviour in FSLL-II and BA\nhighlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive\ndark energy effects.

Throughout the years,\ndifferent notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial\ncurvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we\nshow that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent\nnotions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a\nsingle-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type\nII QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric\nbackgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the\nfield equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II\nQTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II\nQTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess\nsecond-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to\nprove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that\nthe reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For\nevery theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically\nsymmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncharacterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation."}

In this work, we\npropose a novel extension to astrometry.net that incorporates stellar spectral\ntype, which is derived from hyperspectral imagery, into the matching process.\nBy adding this spectral dimension to each star detection, we constrain the\nsearch space and improve match specificity, enabling successful astrometric\nsolutions with significantly fewer stars. Our modified pipeline demonstrates\nimproved fit rates and reduced failure cases in cluttered or ambiguous star\nfields, which is especially critical for autonomous space situational awareness\nand traffic management. Our results suggest that modest spectral resolution,\nwhen incorporated into existing geometric frameworks, can dramatically improve\nrobustness and efficiency in onboard star identification systems."}

The predictions of the model show a non-conventional scalar spectrum\ngoverned by two new parameters in the collapse rate, whose aim is twofold: on\none side, to account for the primordial cosmic structure, and on the other to\nexplain the suppression amplitude associated with long-wavelength modes,\nthereby eliminating the occurrence of eternal inflation. Furthermore, this\nmodel can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$\nangular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the\nlatest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational\nconstraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\\ell$\nsuppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum. We conclude that the\nPlanck data support the solution presented in the previous works, in other\nwords, that the model allows us to solve simultaneously the emergence of the\ncosmic structure and, at the same time, avoid the eternal inflation scenario."}
