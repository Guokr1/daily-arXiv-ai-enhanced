However, our\nunderstanding of its global properties remains limited. Using nine years of\ndata from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we\nperformed a quantitative statistical analysis to explore the spatial\ndistribution of the magnetic fields, solar wind and planetary ions in the\nmagnetosheath. We discovered significant asymmetries in the magnetic field,\nsolar wind protons, and planetary ions between the quasi-perpendicular and\nquasi-parallel magnetosheaths. The asymmetries in the Martian magnetosheath\nexhibit both similarities and differences compared to those in the Earth's and\nVenus' magnetosheaths. These results indicate that the Martian magnetosheath is\ndistinctly shaped by both shock geometry and planetary ions."}

The entire initial\nuncertainty set is subdivided into subsets through Automatic Domain Splitting\n(ADS) techniques to control the accuracy of the Taylor expansions. The\nmethodology samples the initial conditions of the relative state and evaluates\nthe polynomial expansions for each sample while retaining their temporal\ndependency. The classical numerical integration of the initial statistics over\nthe set of conditions for which a collision occurs is thus reduced to an\nevaluation of mono-dimensional time polynomials. Specifically, samples reaching\na relative distance below a critical value are identified along with the time\nat which this occurs. The approach is tested against a Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation for various literature test cases, yielding accurate results and a\nconsistent gain in computational time."}

We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a\nreconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and\ncompared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations.\nThe simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy\ndistributions for both species, but generally underestimate the\nvery-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical\nparameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial\nupstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed\ndistributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in\nfully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic\nparameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the\nneed for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the\nobserved particle energization more accurately."}

At\nthe stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is\n~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the\nlight collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric\nX-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path\nfor a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy\nrange utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form\nfactor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be\neasily adaptable for space-based missions."}

In this paper we focus on a new high-bandwidth frequency\nmultiplexed TES readout system developed for CUPID, a neutrinoless double beta\ndecay experiment that will replace CUORE. In order to achieve the high energy\nresolution requirements for CUPID, the readout noise of the system must be kept\nto a minimum. Low TES operating resistance and long wiring between the readout\nSQUID and the warm electronics are needed for CUPID, prompting a careful\nconsideration of the design parameters of this application of frequency\nmultiplexing. In this work, we characterize the readout noise of the newly\ndesigned frequency multiplexed TES readout system for CUPID and construct a\nnoise model to understand it. We find that current sharing between the SQUID\ncoil impedance and other branches of the circuit, as well as the long output\nwiring, worsen the readout noise of the system.

While the primary candidate\nis a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many\nother cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral\nproperties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an\nSMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB\nsourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a\ncosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially\nlarge-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use\nthe frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair\ncorrelations and relatively low computational overhead compared to\nspatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations\nwith the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by\nincorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between\npulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal\nstatistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing\nnull-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By\ncombining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to\nspecific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while\nimpacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a\n$p$-value of $\\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency\nsearch.

Among the various multiplexing\napproaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the\nart, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work,\nwe demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our\nmicrowave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer\ntailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR)\nelectronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

First, we\nemploy the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations to derive the 4-momentum and\n4-velocity of spinning particles, and introduce the effective potential for\nradial motion using the components of the 4-momentum. We find that an increase\nin the quantum parameter $\\zeta$ leads to a decrease in the effective\npotential, while the spin $S$ significantly affects the magnitude of the\neffective potential. Then, through the effective potential, we investigate the\nproperties of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, and\ndiscuss the timelike condition that spinning particles must satisfy when moving\naround the black hole. Finally, we study the trajectories of spinning particles\non bound orbits around the quantum-corrected black hole and compare them with\nthose around other covariant quantum-corrected black holes. The results show\nthat the trajectories of spinning particles in this quantum-corrected black\nhole model are weakly influenced by $\\zeta$, making them almost\nindistinguishable from those in the Schwarzschild black hole, but they can be\ndistinguished from other covariant quantum-corrected models under certain\ninitial conditions.

While a direct fitting for all\nsignals is infeasible, extracting only one signal will be biased by its overlap\nwith other signals. From this perspective, understanding how the biases arise\nfrom the overlapping and their dependence on the signal parameters is crucial\nfor developing effective algorithms. In this work, we extend the anatomy of\nbiases in single-detector cases to a detector network. Specifically, we focus\non the bias dependence on the sky location, polarization and inclination\nangles, as well as the coalescence time and phase. We propose a new quantity,\nnamed the bias integral, as a useful tool, and establish relationship between\nthe biases in a single detector and that in the entire network, with explicit\ndependence on extrinsic parameters. Using a 3-detector network as an example,\nwe further explore the potential of a network to suppress biases due to the\ndetectors' different locations and orientations. We find that location\ngenerally has a smaller effect than orientation, and becomes significant only\nwhen the time separation between signals is below sub-seconds. Through a\npopulation-level simulation over the extrinsic parameters, we find that nearly\nhalf of overlapping signals will lead to larger biases in the network compared\nto a single detector, highlighting the need to cope with overlapping biases in\na detector network."}

Here, we\npartition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy\nexchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian\nof the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical\nminisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental\ndata that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes\nseveral cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By\ntuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus\nthe speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright\nuniverse.

Since gravity provides the\nweakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of\nprimordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using\nonly a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and\nenvironment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on\nsuper-Hubble modes of {\\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in\nH/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being\nsuper-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for\nsuper-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the\n`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be\ninapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from\nthe nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We\nidentify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part\nof the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate\nthat grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\\it faster} than found\nearlier.

The ringdown signal after BBHs\nmerged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be\ndetected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse.

While the primary candidate\nis a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many\nother cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral\nproperties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an\nSMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB\nsourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a\ncosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially\nlarge-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use\nthe frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair\ncorrelations and relatively low computational overhead compared to\nspatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations\nwith the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by\nincorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between\npulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal\nstatistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing\nnull-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By\ncombining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to\nspecific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while\nimpacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a\n$p$-value of $\\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency\nsearch.
