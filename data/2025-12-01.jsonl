Focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as a paradigm for parity violation, we perturb the Schwarzschild background with a localized potential bump. Our analysis reveals three distinctive phenomena absent in general relativity: 1) topological reconnections of mode branches, 2) counterintuitive mode stabilization that delays overtaking transitions, and 3) scalar mode dominance emerging at intermediate coupling strengths. These dynamical features amplify weak static splittings into observable signatures, establishing a connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics. Our framework provides new pathways for testing modified gravity theories through gravitational wave observations."}

For visualization, we combine discrete sampling with surface contouring and introduce reflection difference maps on central slices to quantify mirror symmetries. Applying this method to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry geometries, we validate the former's spherical symmetry and systematically discuss the hypershadow's dependence on observer position and black hole spin parameters. We also provide compact quantitative measures for size reduction and global displacement, revealing clear monotonic trends.The framework is readily extendible to other metrics and opens the way to numerical studies of more exotic objects, such as black rings and their prospective toroidal hypershadows."}

Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes."}

Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact."}

As this stream was observed near the Sun, it allowed for an unparalleled opportunity to observe pristine, coronal hole wind with little evolution (expansion, stream interaction, etc) effects impacting its properties. Through an ensemble of magnetic connectivity analysis utilizing Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic propagation, we make estimates of the footpoints, and corresponding source region parameters, associated with the stream. We then look at how the low variability regions (small gradient in the in-situ $B_r$) are related to the variability in the field strength at their source ($B_0$). We find that about half of these periods are associated with low source region variability. Lastly, we examine the low $δB / B$ periods between switchback patches and similarly find that they show statistically less variability in their associated $B_0$ value than their switchback patch counterparts. We believe that these results point to a solar source of these ``low-variability\" periods, that warrants further investigation with composition diagnostics and more complex modeling techniques."}

Resistive bolometers are limited by electronic noise and the parasitic thermal load of wired readouts, while state-of-the-art nanomechanical resonators require vacuum packaging to maintain the mechanical $Q$ needed for sensitivity, preventing simultaneous fast and high-sensitivity operation. Here, we introduce and demonstrate an uncooled thermal detector that addresses these challenges via an all-optical transduction mechanism. The heterogeneously integrated pixel is engineered for minimal thermal mass, combining pyrolytic carbon absorbers for broadband LWIR absorption, hollow zirconia structures for ultra-low-conductance thermal isolation -- leaving gas-mediated convection as the dominant tunable pathway -- and a silicon photonic crystal cavity that serves as a high-$Q$ optical thermometer. Operating at ambient temperature and pressure, we measure a specific detectivity of $1.1\\times10^{7}$ Jones and a thermal time constant of $34~μ\\mathrm{s}$, corresponding to a speed that surpasses typical high-sensitivity uncooled technologies by an order of magnitude. While the demonstrated sensitivity is instrument-limited, our analysis shows that the device architecture itself supports a >25-fold performance enhancement toward its fundamental thermorefractive-noise-limited value ($3.1\\times10^{8}$ Jones). Crucially, because the optical readout is pressure-insensitive, the operating point can be tuned along the speed-sensitivity trade-off. We expect this architecture to provide a general route toward scalable, high-performance thermal imaging systems."}

Here, we develop a unified scattering framework that rigorously establishes this connection for arbitrary inhomogeneous, lossless electromagnetic and acoustic media, as well as for controlling multiple objects individually. Variational identities relate parametric changes of the medium to perturbations of the scattering fields, from which the GWS matrix emerges as a natural generator of radiation forces and torques. For a single object, its extremal eigenstates yield maximal force or torque along a chosen direction; for multiple objects, the same framework defines Pareto-optimal compromises among competing objectives and reveals uncertainty relations for their simultaneous optimization. This establishes a comprehensive foundation towards collective and selective manipulation of objects in complex media."}

ASTAROTH is a project aimed at developing the next generation of such detectors by reading out their scintillation light with SiPM matrices operated at cryogenic temperatures. This paper describes the innovative design of the ASTAROTH cryostat, consisting of a double-walled copper-steel cryogenic chamber that cools the detectors by means of a liquid argon bath. The detectors are thermalized in a helium atmosphere at a temperature tunable from 87 to 150 K. The design has been validated in terms of heat transfer efficiency and mechanical stress, developing of a nonlinear multiphysics model. The mechanical properties of OFHC copper were experimentally evaluated on dedicated tensile samples. The simulation results show that the structural integrity is guaranteed. At the highest operating temperature, the region with the steepest temperature gradient exhibits stresses that slightly exceed the yield strength of copper (localized strain-hardened condition). Following construction, the cryostat was commissioned and has been in regular operation for over 30 cooling cycles, with no signs of degradation. The temperature can be tuned across the full target range and remains stable within 0.1 K. These results demonstrate that this is a viable design for next-generation dark matter detectors, as well as for a variety of applications requiring uniform and tunable gas-conducted cooling of instrumentation."}

Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging.

The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the capabilities of our pipeline in the context of recovering the intrinsic profiles and associated parameters, such as dispersion measure, frequency scaling index, scattering time, pulse broadening function, and time of arrival residuals. We use simulated profiles to rigorously test and validate the efficiency of our recovery pipeline. These simulated profiles encompass single and multi-component Gaussians, designed to emulate the diverse nature of pulsar profiles. By comparing the recovered profiles and parameters to their injected values, as derived from simulations, we provide a robust evaluation of the pipeline's performance along with its drawbacks and limitations."}

While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models."}

LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data."}

In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal \"saturation charge\" $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the \"attracted\" charge exceeds the upper bound for the \"repelled\" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\\mathrm{w}}$."}

To study these dynamics, we require high-resolution, photometrically calibrated observations. Over the last 9 years, the Juno spacecraft's optical camera, JunoCam, has generated a unique dataset with high spatial resolution, wide coverage during perijove passes, and a long baseline. However, JunoCam lacks absolute photometric calibration, hindering quantitative analysis of the Jovian atmosphere. Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a proxy for a calibrated sensor, we present a novel method for performing unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) between JunoCam and HST, focusing on addressing the resolution discrepancy between the two sensors. Our structure-preserving I2I method, SP-I2I, incorporates explicit frequency-space constraints designed to preserve high-frequency features ensuring the retention of fine, small-scale spatial structures - essential for studying Jupiter's atmosphere. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation methods are inadequate to address this problem, and, importantly, we show the broader impact of our proposed solution on relevant remote sensing data for the pansharpening task."}

We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial \"up\" and \"down\" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions. At asymptotically late times, the presence of the halo does not alter the Price-law decay, which remains identical to that of a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum."}

Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 < 0.01$ and $< 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\\sim 10^6\\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision."}

We analyze the role of non-conserved energy-momentum tensor equations and investigate their influence on particle production within an irreversible thermodynamic framework. By introducing a novel Lagrangian, we derive modified field equations and establish their relationship with matter production, both with and without entropy generation. Our analysis focuses on ideal fluid models and extends to spatially flat LFRW cosmologies, providing key equations that govern energy density, pressure, and curvature dynamics. Furthermore, we propose a bouncing cosmological model, in which the universe undergoes cycles of contraction and expansion, avoiding the singularity associated with the Big Bang. Our results indicate that this bouncing scenario is feasible within the Rastall-like gravity framework, supported by particle production processes and stability conditions. The violation of energy conditions near the bounce point further confirms the consistency of this alternative cosmological model. The present work is focused on the theoretical foundations and internal consistency of the model; possible observational implications will be addressed in future investigations. We conclude that the proposed theory offers a coherent phenomenological approach to matter production and provides new insights into non-standard cosmological evolution."}

Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics."}

We derive the effective scalar potential governing wave dynamics, which when viewed in the tortoise coordinate, exhibits two extremely sharp and widely separated barriers. These barriers form a resonant cavity and are a direct consequence of the near-horizon geometry of the wormhole mouths. Using time-domain integration, we analyze the wormhole's response to an initial scalar wave packet inside the throat. We find that the late-time signal contains a distinct train of echoes whose amplitude depends on the angular momentum number $l$. We show that higher $l$ modes produce significantly stronger echoes, as the corresponding potential barriers are taller and more reflective, which results in more efficient trapping of the wave within the wormhole throat."}

They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM \"counting function\". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a \"wave-mean flow\" approach to BH binary dynamics."}

However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL."}

To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \\texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime."}

Within a thin-disk accretion model and the ZAMO framework, we numerically solve the geodesics equation of photon and simulate the corresponding thin-disk images and polarization patterns. The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect."}

The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\\propto{|p - {p_*}|^γ}$, with a critical exponent $γ\\approx 0.5$."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power.\n  Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time \"tails\", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function.\n  We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions."}

In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll."}

While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models."}

Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 < 0.01$ and $< 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\\sim 10^6\\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision."}
