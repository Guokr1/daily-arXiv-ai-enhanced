We compute first-order minimal-length corrections to the\nquantum speed limit (QSL) for three cases: uniform superpositions in an\ninfinite square well, coherent harmonic-oscillator states, and\nsqueezed-oscillator states. We identify a universal amplification law: for any\npure state, the fractional shift of either speed limit scales linearly with\n$\\beta$ and algebraically with the state's effective Hilbert-space size. As the\neffective Hilbert-space dimension can be exceedingly large, the associated\nminimal-length signatures are amplified by several orders of magnitude.

Point-particle black hole perturbation\ntheory (ppBHPT), which expands the Einstein equations in the small-mass-ratio\nlimit, offers a computationally efficient alternative but is expected to break\ndown in the comparable-mass regime because it neglects nonlinear effects.\nNonetheless, several recent studies have shown that ppBHPT can model\nnon-spinning binaries with high accuracy when supplemented by simple\ncalibrations or a first post-adiabatic (PA) correction. Here we assess the\napplicability of ppBHPT to quasi-circular binaries with a spinning primary by\ncomparing waveform amplitudes, orbital frequencies, and orbital phases.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) provides the highest-resolution\nradio intensity maps, crucial for detailed studies of compact sources like\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) and their relativistic jets. Analyzing jet\ncomponents in these maps traditionally involves manual Gaussian fitting, a\ntime-consuming bottleneck for large datasets. To address this, we present an\nautomated batch-processing tool, based on the Gaussian fitting capabilities of\nCASA, designed to streamline VLBI jet component characterization (AAP-Imfit).\nOur algorithm sets a detection limit, performs automatic 2D Gaussian fitting,\nand removes model artifacts, efficiently extracting component flux densities\nand positions. This method enables systematic and reproducible analysis,\nsignificantly reducing the time required for fitting extensive VLBI datasets.\nWe validated AAP-Imfit by using VLBI observations of the blazars 3C 279 and 3C\n454.3, comparing our results with published fits. The close agreement in\nresidual root mean square (RMS) values and model/residual-to-map RMS ratios\nconfirms the accuracy of our automated approach in reproducing original flux\ndistributions. While visual inspection remains important for complex or faint\nfeatures, this routine significantly accelerates VLBI component fitting, paving\nthe way for large-scale statistical studies of jet dynamics."}
