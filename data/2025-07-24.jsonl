Wang"], "title": "Spintronic Bayesian Hardware Driven by Stochastic Magnetic Domain Wall Dynamics", "comment": null, "summary": "As artificial intelligence (AI) advances into diverse applications, ensuring\nreliability of AI models is increasingly critical. Conventional neural networks\noffer strong predictive capabilities but produce deterministic outputs without\ninherent uncertainty estimation, limiting their reliability in safety-critical\ndomains. Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs), which introduce randomness, have\nemerged as a powerful approach for enabling intrinsic uncertainty\nquantification. However, traditional CMOS architectures are inherently designed\nfor deterministic operation and actively suppress intrinsic randomness. This\nposes a fundamental challenge for implementing PNNs, as probabilistic\nprocessing introduces significant computational overhead. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a Magnetic Probabilistic Computing (MPC) platform-an\nenergy-efficient, scalable hardware accelerator that leverages intrinsic\nmagnetic stochasticity for uncertainty-aware computing. This physics-driven\nstrategy utilizes spintronic systems based on magnetic domain walls (DWs) and\ntheir dynamics to establish a new paradigm of physical probabilistic computing\nfor AI. The MPC platform integrates three key mechanisms: thermally induced DW\nstochasticity, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA), and tunneling\nmagnetoresistance (TMR), enabling fully electrical and tunable probabilistic\nfunctionality at the device level. As a representative demonstration, we\nimplement a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) inference structure and validate its\nfunctionality on CIFAR-10 classification tasks. Compared to standard 28nm CMOS\nimplementations, our approach achieves a seven orders of magnitude improvement\nin the overall figure of merit, with substantial gains in area efficiency,\nenergy consumption, and speed. These results underscore the MPC platform's\npotential to enable reliable and trustworthy physical AI systems."}

Recent research on discrete systems showed that this\neffect can pose a barrier for waves hitting an interface between reciprocal and\nnon-reciprocal systems. Under certain conditions, however, waves can tunnel\nthrough this barrier, similar to the tunneling of particles in quantum\nmechanics. This work proposes and investigates an active acoustic metamaterial\ndesign to realize this tunneling phenomenon in the acoustical wave domain. The\nmetamaterial consists of an acoustic waveguide with microphones and\nloudspeakers embedded in its wall. Starting from a purely discrete\nnon-Hermitian lattice model of the system, a hybrid continuous-discrete\nacoustic model is derived, resulting in distributed feedback control laws to\nrealize the desired behavior for acoustic waves. The proposed control laws are\nvalidated using frequency and time domain finite element method simulations,\nwhich include lumped electro-acoustic loudspeaker models.

In this\ncontext, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our\nscenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction\nof approximately 30$\\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$."}

Using ray-tracing techniques, we conduct a\ndetailed analysis of the black hole's image, redshift distribution, and\nintensity distributions at different observation frequencies. The results\ndemonstrate that spin has a more significant effect on the distortion of the\ninner shadow than charge, and the observer's inclination angle plays a critical\nrole in shaping the redshift distribution, especially near the innermost stable\ncircular orbit. Additionally, the intensity is found to be higher at 86 GHz\nthan at 230 GHz. This study highlights the crucial role of the accretion disk's\ngeometry in determining the black hole's image and redshift effects, thereby\nproviding a refined theoretical framework to guide future observational efforts\ntargeting the Kerr-Sen black hole and its electromagnetic signals."}

The circular light orbits,\nwhich define the photon sphere, are also analyzed for both types of plasma\nmedia, highlighting their impact on the shadow boundary. The shadow properties\nof the black hole are examined in detail, and constraints on the model\nparameters are derived by comparing the theoretical shadow radius with\nobservational measurements of Sgr A* and M87* obtained by the Event Horizon\nTelescope Collaboration. We also study the black hole shadow images along with\nthe corresponding intensity profiles produced by a radially infalling accretion\nflow in the plasma environment.

The presence of asymptotic states ensures gauge invariance of the\ntheory, but, in the case of gravity, the states exist only in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes, that limits possible topologies. Then we have two ways. The\nfirst way is to consider only asymptotically flat spacetimes. In fact, it\nreduces quantum gravity to quantum field theory on a given background. The\nsecond way is to reject the assumption about asymptotic states. In the case of\nnon-trivial topology, one cannot cover the whole spacetime with the only\ncoordinate system. One has to introduce various reference frames fixed by\ndifferent gauge conditions in different spacetime regions. The Hamiltonian\ndescribing a gravitating system will depend on gauge conditions. It leads to\nthe conclusion that unitary evolution may be broken down. This conclusion\ncannot be obtained in approaches based on the Wheeler - DeWitt equation or\nmaking use of the assumption about asymptotic states. The assessment of this\nconclusion is given."}

This is a rather sensational observation\nand there are two possibilities for the nature of these mass-gap region\nastrophysical objects, these are either small black holes that result from the\nmergers of ordinary mass neutron stars, or these are heavy neutron stars. In\nthe line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall\nexamine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity\ninflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of\nthe Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of\ncosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model,\noriginating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate\nwhich models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star\nphenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust\ndouble shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic\nequations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the\nENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with\nseveral well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of\nstate and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature,\nalso known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the\nequation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the\ntheoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of\nstate is well inside the mass-gap region. Another mentionable feature that\nstroked us with surprise is the fact that even cosmologically non-viable\ninflationary models produced a viable neutron star phenomenology, which most\nlikely has to be a model-dependent feature."}

Using the method\nrecently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ\nthe Moyal twist $\\partial_r \\wedge \\partial_\\theta$ to implement\nnon-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\\Theta$. We begin by verifying\nthat the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the\nevent horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The\nKretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns\nout that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and\nrelated quantities are not expanded to second order in $\\Theta$. We derive the\nthermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature\n$T^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$, and heat capacity\n$C_V^{(\\Theta,\\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\\text{rem}}$ is estimated by\nimposing $T^{(\\Theta,\\ell)} \\to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant\nindicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is\nanalyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using\nthe residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number\ndensity for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the\nmethods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field\nis obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and\nthe time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\\Theta$ and $\\ell$\n(Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the\nperihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay."}
