Though great advancements have been made in image-based sorting of\ncells and particles (<50 micrometer), their translation for high-throughput\nsorting of larger biomaterials and particles (>50 micrometer) has been more\nlimited. An image-based detection technique is highly desirable due to richness\nof the data (including size, shape, color, morphology, and optical density)\nthat can be extracted from live images of individualized biomaterials or\nparticles. Such a detection technique is label-free and can be integrated with\na contact-free actuation mechanism such as one based on traveling surface\nacoustic waves (TSAWs). Recent advances in using TSAWs for sorting cells and\nparticles (<50 micrometer) have demonstrated short response times (<1 ms), high\nbiocompatibility, and reduced energy requirements to actuate. Additionally,\nTSAW-based devices are miniaturized and easier to integrate with an image-based\ndetection technique. In this work, a high-throughput image-detection based\nlarge particle microfluidic sorting technique is implemented. The technique is\nused to separate binary mixtures of small and large polyethylene particles\n(ranging between ~45-180 micrometer in size). All particles in flow were first\noptically interrogated for size, followed by actuations using momentum transfer\nfrom TSAW pulses, if they satisfied the size cutoff criterion. The effect of\ncontrol parameters such as duration and power of TSAW actuation pulse, inlet\nflow rates, and sample dilution on sorting efficiency and throughput was\nobserved. At the chosen conditions, this sorting technique can sort on average\n~4.9-34.3 particles/s (perform ~2-3 actuations/s), depending on the initial\nsample composition and concentration."}
