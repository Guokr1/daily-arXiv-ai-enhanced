Self-validating\nthermocouples aim to address this issue by using a miniature phase-change cell\n(fixed-point) in close proximity to the measurement junction (tip) of the\nthermocouple. The fixed point is a crucible containing an ingot of metal with a\nknown melting temperature. When the process temperature being monitored passes\nthrough the melting temperature of the ingot, the thermocouple output exhibits\na \"plateau\" during melting. Since the melting temperature of the ingot is\nknown, the thermocouple can be recalibrated in situ. Identifying the melting\nplateau to determine the onset of melting is reasonably well established but\nrequires manual intervention involving zooming in on the region around the\nactual melting temperature, a process which can depend on the shape of the\nmelting plateau. For the first time, we present a novel machine learning\napproach to recognize and identify the characteristic shape of the melting\nplateau and once identified, to quantity the point at which melting begins,\nalong with its associated uncertainty.

Two well-studied examples are $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity\nand Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same\nvacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter\nsuffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the\nstrong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to\ngenuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting\nframework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a\ngravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with\nnontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB\ngravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile\nsetting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic\ncorrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\\mathcal{R})$\nterms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting\nsolutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes\nwith certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a\nnontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the\nblack-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity\nstructure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of\npure EdGB gravity.

As is known, the leakage currents of p-n and Schottky\njunctions affect the overall performance of the devices and reduce the\nreliability of the devices. In order to achieve optimum device design, it is\nessential to fully understand the physical principle of the leakage currents.\nIn traditional theory, defects provide a path for leakage current to travel. In\nthis study, a novel theoretical model based on impurity-photovoltaic-effect is\nproposed to explain the leakage currents. It is well known that any object at a\nroom-temperature emits infrared (IR) photons due to blackbody radiation. As is\nalso well known, there is no absolutely pure material, and any material\ncontains unavoidable defects associated with impurities. The self-absorption of\nthe IR emission could be achieved through the sub-band-gap excitations due to\ndefect-related intermediate levels in forbidden energy band-gap, creating\ncarriers (electrons and holes). Some of the carriers diffuse into the built-in\nelectric field of the junction. The built-in field then sweeps out electrons\nand holes in opposite directions, forming IR-generated photocurrent. Therefore,\nthe leakage current is regarded as photocurrent. In addition to p-n junctions,\nsome junctions exist in many semiconductor devices such as p-i-n diode and\ncharge-coupled device (CCD), and these junctions also have built-in field due\nto contact potential difference.

The two\ndominant interpretations favor hot exozodiacal dust or a faint companion, as\nboth can produce similar signatures. Method: We modeled a system consisting of\na star and a faint companion within a field of view of 2au x 2au. We calculated\nthe visibility and closure phases for three VLTI instruments (PIONIER, GRAVITY,\nand MATISSE) and four telescope configurations. Aim: We aim to investigate the\ninterferometric signatures of faint companions and assess their detectability.\nWe explore limitations of current detection methods and evaluate the challenges\nin distinguishing between hot exozodiacal dust and a faint companion as the\nsource of the observed excess. Results: We derived an upper limit for the\ncompanion-induced visibility deficit and closure phase. Contrary to the common\ninterpretation that near-zero closure phases rule out the presence of a\ncompanion, we show that companions can remain undetected in closure phase data,\nas indicated by significant non-detection probabilities, yet, these companions\ncan still produce measurable visibility deficits. We confirmed our results by\nreevaluating an L-band observation of kappa Tuc A.

We then find that upon loading the stable photon\nsphere, its area remains invariant. Furthermore, at a critical threshold\nloading limit for this zero-width null matter shell, we are able to produce a\nmetric containing an extremal horizon with an AdS$_2\\times$S$^2$ geometry\ncompletely independent of the cosmological curvature. This hitherto\nunencountered and therefore unexpected result is a phenomenon unseen in\nstandard nonconformal second-order metrics with nonzero cosmological constants."}

Gralla"], "title": "Can black holes evaporate past extremality?", "comment": null, "summary": "Black holes with sufficiently large initial charge and mass will\nHawking-evaporate towards the extremal limit. The emission slows as the\ntemperature approaches zero, but still reaches the point where a single Hawking\nquantum would make the object superextremal, removing the horizon. We take this\nsemiclassical prediction at face value and ask: When the emission occurs, what\nis revealed? Using a model of thin-shell collapse with subsequent\naccretion/evaporation by a null flux of ingoing positive/negative energy\n(charged Vaidya spacetime glued to a flat interior), we find two possible\noutcomes: (i) For shells that are initially very tightly bound, a timelike\nsingularity forms and later appears; or (ii) for unbound or modestly bound\nshells, the matter re-emerges as a null shell that expands to infinity. This\nexpanding remnant has been bathed in the ingoing Hawking quanta during\nevaporation and presumably carries correlations with the outgoing quanta,\noffering the attractive possibility of studying information paradox issues in a\nsetup where spacetime curvatures are globally small, so that quantum gravity is\nnot required. Even for ordinary black holes that evaporate down to the Planck\nsize, we propose a radical new scenario for the interior: rather than forming a\nsingularity, the collapsing matter settles onto an \\textit{outgoing} null\ntrajectory \\textit{inside} the horizon for the entirety of evaporation."}

The results\nshow that the real part of the frequencies increases with the charge parameter\n$g^2$, while the absolute value of the imaginary part decreases as $g^2$\nincreases. In contrast, both the real part and the absolute value of the\nimaginary part decrease as the quintessence parameter $c$ increases. These\ntrends are observed for both values of the quintessence state parameter,\n$\\omega_q =-2/3$ and $\\omega_q =-4/9$; however, the effects become more\npronounced as $\\omega_q$ approaches $-1$. The quasi--normal frequencies tend to\nhave finite values, which could facilitate their observational detection.\nMoreover, the presence of quintessence leads to a slower damping of the\nperturbations."}
