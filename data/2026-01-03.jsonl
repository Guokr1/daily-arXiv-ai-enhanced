We present a circuit-free, wholly optical approach using diffraction from a skin-interfaced nanostructured surface to detect minute skin strains from the arterial pulse. A smartphone camera records the shifting diffraction pattern in real time, removing the need for spectrometers or other optical hardware. In phantom and human studies, we recovered high-fidelity arterial pulse waves and detected benign arrhythmic events in close agreement with a clinical reference. Derived waveforms captured features linked to arterial stiffness, a key cardiovascular risk marker. Our approach uses battery-free, cost-effective, and disposable platforms enabling scalable monitoring for healthcare and broad consumer applications."}

The model, developed in a one-dimensional setting, builds upon the Auricchio-Petrini constitutive formulation for SMAs and couples damage evolution with phase transformation. We study analytically and numerically the homogeneous and localization responses of a bar under both monotonic and cyclic loading, and we investigate various macroscopic behaviors by tuning the constitutive parameters. A key feature of the model is the introduction of a transformation strain limit, beyond which the material is fully martensitic and behaves elastically. This leads to a distinctive behavior in which the region of localized damage widens, yielding a delay of fracture. The capability of the model to predict the fatigue performance is demonstrated by simulating the uniaxial response of Ni-Ti multi-wire samples under different loading conditions. The results show promising agreement with experimental fatigue life data, enabling the discrimination between safe and critical loading scenarios."}

Considering the severe challenges optical telescopes face in Antarctica, including extremely low temperatures, unattended operation, and limited power supply and network transmission, we have designed and developed the Antarctic TianMu prototype telescope based on drift-scan charge-coupled device technology. In October 2022, our prototype (with an aperture of 18 cm), named AT-Proto was transported to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica aboard China's 39th Antarctic Research Expedition. It has since operated stably and reliably in the frigid environment for over two years, demonstrating the significant advantages of this technology in polar astronomical observations.

While the study addresses interesting phenomenological questions, we identify several inconsistencies that compromise the validity of the reported results. Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability. We also highlight terminology regarding the nature of the horizonless solution and the physical interpretation of plasma parameters that requires correction. We clarify these points to ensure the robustness of the model's asymptotic limits."}

This paper systematically outlines the commissioning data of the prototype telescope in 2023, the primary data processing pipeline, and the preliminary data products. The core pipeline encompasses four key stages: Data preprocessing, instrumental effect correction, astrometric solution, and full-field stellar photometry. Here, we release the 2023 data products, which specifically include reduced image data and a photometric catalog, for which, preliminary analyses demonstrate robust performance. Using Gaia Data Release 3 as a reference catalog, the astrometric precision, quantified by the root mean square of positional errors, is determined to be better than approximately 2 arcseconds, validating the observational capabilities of the system. For a 30-second exposure, the detection limit in the G-band is achieved at 15.00~mag, with a detection threshold of 1.5~$σ$. The photometric errors are below 0.1~mag for the majority of stars brighter than 14.00~mag.

However, by relaxing the stationarity condition on the metric, it has been shown that oscillatory solitonic solutions -- known as oscillatons -- exist. Oscillatons share several properties with boson stars, including comparable compactness and mass ranges. However, their time-dependent nature can lead to potentially discriminating observable signatures. In this work, we explore the observational properties of oscillatons. We find that stable oscillatory circular orbits exist, extending down to the center of the configuration, supporting the possibility of accretion disk structures within the star. We compute the deflection of light rays and verify that it is largely insensitive to the time dependence of the metric. Despite this, the oscillatory behavior of the redshift factor has a strong effect on the observed intensity profiles from accretion disks, producing a breathing-like image whose frequency depends on the mass of the scalar field. In fact, their oscillation period may lie within the observational windows of the Event Horizon Telescope for Sgr A$^{*}$ and M87$^{*}$, suggesting the possibility that this ``twinkling\" behavior could be tested via near-horizon imaging of these objects."}

My contact and friendship with Sverre started a few decades ago being sent to Cambridge to learn NBODY5, counting input parameters, and learning about the fact that even a sophisticated code (which had already at that time quite a history) requires permanent maintenance and bug fixes. Managed by Sverre, who relentlessly ran his code and responded to the widely spread crowd of customer colleagues. There has been a phase of massive and fast development and improvements due to vectorization, parallelization, GRAPE and GPU acceleration, and Sverre has been always on top of it if not ahead, but also fully adopting ideas of collaborators, once they tested well. NBODY6++GPU and NBODY7 entered the scene, and also recent new competitors, such as PETAR or BIFROST . We all have learnt a lot from Sverre, and strive to continue in his open-minded spirit, for open source and exchange. A striking evidence for the further growth of the industry is the number of papers here (and two of them follow in this session, but also in other sessions) using and further developing the aforementioned codes, as well as the occurrence of new and competing codes, which keep the field alive."}

By studying thermodynamics of massless scalar fields, we show that the only value of $ξ$ consistent with stable thermodynamic equilibrium at all temperatures and for all radii of the universe is $1/6$, i.e., corresponding to the conformal coupling.

We present an unsupervised, reconstruction-based anomaly-detection strategy for fast Region-of-Interest (ROI) extraction that operates directly on minimally processed camera frames. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images learns the detector noise morphology without labels, simulation, or fine-grained calibration. Applied to standard data-taking frames, localized reconstruction residuals identify particle-induced structures, from which compact ROIs are extracted via thresholding and spatial clustering. Using real data from the CYGNO optical TPC prototype, we compare two pedestal-trained autoencoder configurations that differ only in their training objective, enabling a controlled study of its impact. The best configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with an inference time of approximately 25 ms per frame on a consumer GPU.

Further analysis revealed that approximately 70% of the background originates from environmental gamma radiation, while the remaining contribution mainly comes from intrinsic radioactivity of detector materials, particularly the FR-4 based field cage and readout plane. Based on the knowledge gained from the experiments and simulations, an optimization of the TPC system has been proposed, with simulation predicting a potential reduction of the background rate to 0.0012 $\\rm cpm/cm^2$."}

Those include magnetic reconnection, particle acceleration, radiation transport, and various plasma physics processes, all of which occur throughout the heliosphere and rest of the Universe. Flares and eruptive events are also components of geo-effective space weather. Their impacts from a space weather perspective are numerous, such as harm to satellites, disruption to GPS, communications and power systems, and impacts on passenger air travel. A comprehensive understanding of solar flares is therefore not just a compelling science problem, but also important for national security and infrastructure. This white paper (WP) addresses critical open science questions related to solar flares. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK has a robust and vibrant solar flare community. We are key partners in international collaborations, and also provide instrumentation for existing and upcoming ESA/NASA/JAXA space missions. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field, achieve Solar System Advisory Panel roadmap goals, and to work under the UK Space Agency's National Space Strategy Pillars. Several complementary WPs have been submitted that discuss instruments or concepts that would directly address the observational requirements we describe (including: SPARK, solar optimised IFUs, Solar-C/EUVST, and OSIRIS), as well as required numerical modelling efforts and infrastructure."}

We propose a novel approach for the indirect detection of the Unruh effect without relying on the former restriction. Previous studies have shown that probing the decoherence of an Unruh-DeWitt detector can significantly reduce the acceleration required for observing the effect by several orders of magnitude compared to earlier proposals. Building on this idea, we develop a theoretical framework describing a non-inertial observer equipped with a detector undergoing non-uniform, time-dependent acceleration. We show that, in a non-uniformly accelerated Rindler spacetime, the particle distribution perceived in the Minkowski vacuum acquires a time-dependent modification of the standard Unruh spectrum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum entanglement leads to a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum into squeezed states."}

Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations."}

Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively.

The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime."}

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space--the escape fraction--remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1--100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS)."}

Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems."}

Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\\;M_\\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.\n  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\\mathcal{C}_{\\max}\\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $λ_{\\rm BL}\\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors."}

Within a semiclassical framework, we compute the energy emission of Hawking radiation by introducing a massless scalar field as a test field, considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases. For the minimally coupled case, we find that loop quantum gravity effects become crucial at the late stage of the evaporation process, causing the emission rate to slow down and eventually terminate, leading to the formation of a black hole remnant. A quasi-normal mode analysis indicates the stability of this remnant. For the non-minimally coupled case, we show that the fate of the black hole strongly depends on the value of the coupling constant $ξ$. Focusing on the cases $ξ=\\pm1$, we find that for $ξ=1$, the energy emission rate accelerates at late times and no remnant is formed, whereas for $ξ=-1$, the emission rate slows down and eventually terminates, resulting in a stable black hole remnant, as supported by the corresponding quasi-normal mode analysis."}

Working in the coincident gauge, we perform the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and classify QSN models into distinct cases according to the numbers of their primary constraints. For cases that are physically viable in the sense that both a consistent cosmological background and tensor gravitational waves exist, we count the number of degrees of freedom based on two approaches. First we investigate the linear cosmological perturbations around an FLRW background. Then we perform a Dirac-Bergmann Hamiltonian constraint analysis to count the number of DOFs at the nonperturbative level. We focus on three representative cases. In case II, both the perturbative and nonperturbative approaches yield the same result, which indicates that the theory propagates 10 degrees of freedom. In contrast, in cases V and VI, the Hamiltonian analysis yields 8 degrees of freedom, while only 6 and 5 modes are visible at linear order in perturbations, respectively. This indicates that additional modes are strongly coupled on cosmological backgrounds."}

The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves."}

We formulate this effect as a gravitational holonomy associated to the internal Lorentz group. The magnitude of both effects is computed due to gravitational waves generated by a localized source far from the detector, at leading order in the inverse distance. For freely falling observers, the phase shift is zero and the polarization rotation becomes the dominant effect."}

Motivated by the increasing precision of cosmic microwave background and large-scale-structure observations, we examine whether Higgs-like inflation remains compatible with current data in this extended gravitational setting. Working within the slow-roll approximation, we analyze the inflationary dynamics both analytically and numerically. In the dominant-coupling regime we derive closed-form expressions for the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as functions of the number of e-folds, and we subsequently relax this assumption by numerically solving the slow-roll equations. Confrontation with the latest constraints from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR1, and BICEP/Keck shows that Higgs-like inflation in $f(T,φ)$ gravity is fully consistent with current bounds, naturally accommodating the preferred shift in the scalar spectral index and leading to distinctive tensor-sector signatures."}

Lopes"], "title": "Stellar modeling within regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of current astrophysical constraints", "comment": "Accepted for publication in the Chinese Journal of Physics", "summary": "In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \\equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime."}

We find that when the coupling constant exceeds a critical value, solutions with a frequency approaching zero appear. In the finite-order corrections case $n=2$ (Gauss-Bonnet gravity), the matter field and energy density diverge near the origin as $ω\\to 0$. In contrast, for $n\\geq 3$, the divergence is efficiently suppressed, both the field and the energy density remain finite everywhere, and both the matter field and energy density remain finite everywhere. In the limit $ω\\to 0$, a class of horizonless frozen star solutions emerges, which are referred to ``frozen stars\". Importantly, frozen stars contain neither curvature singularities nor event horizons. These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero. The frozen star is indistinguishable from that of an extremal black hole outside $r_c$, and its compactness can reach the extremal black hole value."}

We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors."}

Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data."}

The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $α$, $β$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $χ^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $α$, and $β$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH."}

We first introduce the fourth-power term with a coefficient $λ$ to adjust the oscillatory behavior of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near the critical point. Importantly, we show that the nonlinear coefficient $λ$ provides accurate control of this periodicity: a positive $λ$ stretches the region, while a negative $λ$ compresses it. By contrast, the influence of another coefficient $τ$ is more concentrated in regions away from the critical point. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the complex dynamical structure inside black holes and extends the actively control from the fourth- and sixth-power term into the black hole interior region."}

As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework."}

In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\\,M_\\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints.
