In this work, we discuss how one may\ninstead emulate the functionality of certain logic gates by using quasi-digital\nlinear systems (in this case networks of interconnected parallel plate\nwaveguides). This is done by carefully designing the encoding scheme of the\ninput bits (how the input state of each bit maps to an incident electromagnetic\nsignal) and the high/low classification regions of the output signal. To\ndemonstrate this approach, full-wave numerical simulation of elementary 2-input\noperations are presented.

We found that this class of hairy black holes is not thermodynamically\nfavored, and their quasinormal modes indicate they are dynamically unstable. An\ninteresting feature is that when $q < 1/2$, the scalar charge varies only\nslightly with $q$ for a fixed mass. In contrast, for $q>1/2$, the scalar charge\nincreases more rapidly as $q$ increases.
