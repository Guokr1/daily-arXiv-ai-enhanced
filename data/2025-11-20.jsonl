These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs."}

This calls for the development of ultra-sensitive wavefront sensors (WFSs), such as Fourier filtering wavefront sensors (FFWFSs), to be operated at low flux, as well as an increase in the XAO loop frame rate. These sensors, which constitute the baseline for current and future XAO systems, exhibit such a high sensitivity at the expense of a non-linear behaviour that must be properly calibrated and compensated for to deliver the required performance. We aim to validate on-sky a recently proposed method that associates the FFWFS with a focal plane detector, the gain scheduling camera (GSC), to estimate in real time the first-order terms of the sensor non-linearities, known as modal optical gains. We implemented a GSC on the adaptive-optics (AO) bench PAPYRUS to be associated with the existing pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). We compared experimental results to expected results obtained with a high-fidelity numerical twin of the AO system. We validated experimentally the method both in laboratory and on-sky. We demonstrated the capability of the GSC to accurately estimate the optical gains of the PWFS at 100 Hz, corresponding to the current limit in speed imposed by PAPYRUS hardware, but it could be applied at higher frequencies to enable frame-by-frame optical gains tracking. The presented results exhibit good agreement on the optical gains estimation with respect to numerical simulations reproducing the experimental conditions tested. Our experimental results validate the strategy of coupling a FFWFS with a focal-plane camera to master the non-linearities of the sensor. This demonstrates its attractiveness for future XAO application."}

Traditional BSS methods, such as those relying on fixed wavelet dictionaries, enforce sparsity during component separation, but may fall short when faced with the inherent complexity of real astrophysical signals. In this work, we introduce the Learnlet Component Separator (LCS), a novel BSS framework that bridges classical sparsity-based techniques with modern deep learning. LCS utilizes the Learnlet transform: a structured convolutional neural network designed to serve as a learned, wavelet-like multiscale representation. This hybrid design preserves the interpretability and sparsity, promoting properties of wavelets while gaining the adaptability and expressiveness of learned models. The LCS algorithm integrates this learned sparse representation into an iterative source separation process, enabling effective decomposition of multi-channel observations. While conceptually inspired by sparse BSS methods, LCS introduces a learned representation layer that significantly departs from classical fixed-basis assumptions. We evaluate LCS on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating superior separation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods (average gain of about 5 dB on toy model examples). Our results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine signal processing priors with deep learning to address the challenges of next-generation cosmological experiments."}

In order to assess the complementary role of a 60 m starshade for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we develop the optical model of a starshade and simulate solar system imaging at 0 degrees and 60 degrees inclinations. The optical core throughput of a direct-imaging system is a key metric that governs exposure time and the potential exoplanetary yield of a mission. We use our optical model to evaluate core throughput, incorporating 6 m segmented and obscured telescope apertures, over the visible to near-infrared wavelength band (500-1000 nm). Accurate diffractive optical simulations of this form require many large Fourier transforms, with prohibitive run-times, as both the starshade mask and telescope aperture require fine-scale spatial sampling. We introduce a Fourier sampling technique, the Bluestein Fast Fourier Transform (BFFT), to efficiently simulate diffractive optics and enable high-fidelity simulations of core throughput. By characterizing sampling requirements and comparing BFFT's computational complexity to standard Fourier methods (for example, DFT and FFT), we demonstrate its efficiency in our optical pipeline. These methods are implemented in PyStarshade (Taaki 2025), an open-source Python package offering flexible diffraction tools and imaging simulations for starshades. Our results show the HWO starshade used with a segmented off-axis telescope aperture achieves an optimal core throughput measured within a photometric aperture of radius 0.7 lambda/D of 68 percent. With an additionally obscured aperture, a 66 percent core throughput is achieved."}

Compared to SQUID scanning systems, which requiring liquid helium cooling, this system based on the GMI effect offers advantages of room-temperature operation, compact structure, and low cost.

Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models."}

In this paper, we extend the analysis to the null hypersurface at the throat of this modified Einstein-Rosen bridge, where two regular Eddington-Finkelstein metrics render the geometry traversable. Using the Barrabes--Israel formalism in Poisson's reformulation, we evaluate the null shell's surface stress-energy tensor $S^{αβ}$ from the jump of the transverse curvature, revealing a violation of the null energy condition: a lightlike membrane of exotic matter with negative surface energy density and positive tangential pressure. This exotic fluid acts as a repulsive source stabilizing the throat, ensuring consistency with the Einstein field equations, including conservation laws on the shell. Beyond the local characterization, we outline potential observational signatures: (i) gravitational-wave echoes from the photon-sphere cavity; (ii) horizon-scale imaging with duplicated and through-throat photon rings, and non-Kerr asymmetries; (iii) quantum effects such as PT-induced frequency pairing with possible QNM doublets and partial suppression of vacuum flux at the throat; and (iv) a relic cosmological population yielding an effective $Λ_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and seeding voids.

It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions.

In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations."}

Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones of constant $u$ emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where the outgoing null cones emanating from an ingoing-null boundary. We demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations in both settings. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordström solutions."}

Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models.

By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era."}

In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios."}

We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes."}

This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed."}

By contrast, systematic multi-field extensions remain incomplete: while the general field equations for the bi-Horndeski case are known, a general action has not been established, and for cases with three or more fields, neither a general action nor general equations are available. We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions. In particular, we show that antisymmetric structures, such as those identified by Allys, Akama, and Kobayashi, appear within this framework, and indicate that this viewpoint has the potential to account for features captured by known bi-Horndeski equations."}

The choice of vacuum state is crucial, especially since the preinflationary phase predicted by Loop Quantum Cosmology invalidates the choice of the Bunch-Davies state as the preferred vacuum. We adopt a choice which is optimally adapted to the dynamics, so that it provides a non-oscillating (NO) spectrum free of spurious contributions, and permits an asymptotic Hamiltonian diagonalization (AHD) of the perturbations. For this so-called NO-AHD vacuum, we compute the power spectrum using both analytic approximations and numerical integration. Our results confirm the accuracy of our approximations in a wide range of situations, including short- and long-lived inflationary scenarios.

Their properties depend on the space-time symmetry and on the particular polymerisation scheme adopted. In this article we investigate anisotropic models under the Gambini-Benítez-Pullin polymerisation, recently used to quantise spherically symmetric black-holes, whose interiors are isometric to Kantowski-Sachs (KS) space-times. Demanding that the minimum area defined by the bouncing surface matches the Loop Quantum Gravity area gap, we can find its radius alongside the curvature and effective density and pressures at the bounce. The density is always positive, while the pressures are negative enough to avoid the singularity. Due to the positive spatial curvature, the solution is oscillatory, reaching a maximum radius where a re-collapse occurs. Therefore, a positive cosmological constant is included in order to have an eternal expansion to a late de Sitter phase. We have also considered a Bianchi III metric, showing that the bounce is still present, but the space-time is asymptotically flat in this case, with no re-collapse. In this hyperbolic space, the minimal area constraint can also be imposed on compact $2$-surfaces. Nevertheless, in contrast to the KS case, it is enough for avoiding the singularity, independently of polymerisation procedures."}

These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs."}
