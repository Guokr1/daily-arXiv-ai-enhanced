The annealed variant mitigates\ninitialization-dependent convergence to suboptimal local optima of the\nlikelihood function while achieving uncertainties substantially lower than the\nPhoton Transfer (PT) method in the DSERN regime. Although the annealing\nprinciple is optimizer-agnostic, we pair it with PCH-EM for tractability; a\nsingle temperature parameter and simple cooling schedule suffice, without\nre-deriving the original EM update equations. Simulations across varied\nstarting points show more stable parameter estimates with equal or better final\nlikelihoods than the baseline. While designed for DSERN, the method applies\nacross read-noise regimes and matches PT performance outside DSERN.\nPractically, the method enables reliable characterization of DSERN devices,\nincluding direct calibration from raw gray counts to electron counts for photon\nnumber resolving applications."}

We have observed that the deceleration parameter shows a\nsmooth transition from deceleration to acceleration phase and the effective\nequation of state parameter ($\\omega$) approaches to $-1$ at late times. The\n$Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a decreasing profile, confirming quintessence-like\nbehavior, and the statefinder analysis demonstrates trajectories that remain\nnear the $\\Lambda$CDM fixed point but deviate into the quintessence region. The\nevolution of the density parameters satisfies the flatness condition, and the\npredicted age of the Universe lies within $t_0 \\sim 13.7-14.3$ Gyr, consistent\nwith CMB and stellar estimates.
