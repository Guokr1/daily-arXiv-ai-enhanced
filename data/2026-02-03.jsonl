In the Einstein-frame description, these models are dynamically equivalent to standard general relativity coupled to an axion-like pseudoscalar degree of freedom, which naturally drives a period of cosmic inflation. Without committing to a specific microscopic mechanism for reheating, we demonstrate that the post-inflationary reheating dynamics play a crucial role in shaping the inflationary predictions. In particular, we show that assumptions about the reheating temperature and the equation-of-state parameter can significantly affect the predicted values of inflationary observables, highlighting the necessity of consistently incorporating reheating effects in the phenomenological analysis of inflationary models."}

According to his proposal, the gravitational field equations are the consequence of the first law of thermodynamics applied, locally, to a Rindler observer. Together with the dynamical laws of black holes, Jacobson's approach has become a very strong piece of evidence supporting the intimate connection between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum theory. Jacobson's approach being formulated for Riemannian geometries, we have wondered what its consequences would be for non-Riemannian geometries, i.e., those that involve torsion, non metricity, or both. The results of our quest have been particularly appealing: we have found that the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action, arguably ``the simplest one'', does not belong to the pool of gravitational theories available for Nature's selection (except in the Riemannian case). In the search of a unique alternative, we have also considered the hypotheses employed in the formulation of the Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. Together, the two approaches point towards the gravitational theory that derives from the Einstein-Hilbert action plus a term quadratic in the torsion vector as the one that would be selected by Nature in the non-Riemannian case without non metricity. The same strategy cannot be followed in the full non-Riemannian case as the two approaches are mutually inconsistent."}

It is well known that models with single perfect fluid or single scalar field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity develop perturbative instabilities around the crossing, thereby cannot realize the quintom scenario. In this paper, we provide a method to circumvent the instability problem of these models by introducing the coupling of dark energy to the Nieh-Yan density in teleparallel gravity. We show that with this coupling the background evolution is not affected, but the dark energy perturbation is removed from the menu of dynamical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the intrinsic difficulties in the old models."}

These two functions cannot be independently tuned in conventional engineering materials with linear or hyperelasticity. Ligaments achieve this balance through a highly nonlinear tensile response characterized by a J-shaped curve, featuring an extended \"toe region\" of low force up to intermediate strains followed by an inflection, called the \"heel region\" which marks the onset of nonlinear stiffening. Here, we present a framework for characterizing the defining features of J-curve behavior. Based on these features, we define measures for protectiveness and mobility to quantitatively describe the effective stiffness and the level of nonlinearity, thereby elucidating how the J-curve enables decoupled fine-tuning of flexibility and damage protection. A simplified mathematical model, supported by experimental validation, reveals the performance advantages of J-curve materials in antagonistic arrangements and highlights their unique design space compared with linear elastic systems. Furthermore, we develop synthetic J-curve materials capable of self-strain sensing via piezoresistive transduction, enabling their integration into practical devices. Collectively, these materials, models, and insights advance the understanding of nonlinear mechanical mechanisms in natural systems and provide a foundation for harnessing J-curve behavior in engineering applications such as bio-inspired robots."}

We study this system using the global hybrid-Vlasov code Vlasiator, which has recently been extended to model ionospheric physics. We also highlight the significance of 3D magnetic null points, which in our simulation can separate the FTEs into multiple flux ropes. Near the null points, the coiled FTE magnetic field lines are rerouted towards Earth, so that the magnetic footpoints are planted near the Region 1 ionospheric current system. The helicities of the flux ropes are organized by the y-component (GSE) of the magnetic field at the Earth's magnetopause. This occurs in our simulation due to the absence of a y-component of the interplanetary magnetic field, which would normally supply the FTE guide field that determines the helicity. We observe Alfvenic, Earthward-flowing field-aligned currents generated near the magnetopause that correlate with the passage of FTEs nearby. These pulses of current coincide with the formation of rotational geoelectric field structures, that appear near the noon meridian and propagate around the auroral oval towards the nightside."}

The method was previously introduced as a tamper detection method for authenticating a single radiation detector in nuclear safeguards and treaty verification scenarios, and works by randomly sampling detector configuration parameters to produce a sequence of spectra that form a baseline signature of an untampered system. At a later date, after potential tampering, the same random sequence of parameters is used to generate another series of spectra that can be compared against the baseline. Anomalies in the series of comparisons indicate changes in detector behavior, which may be due to tampering. One limitation of this original method is that once the detector has `gone downrange' and may have been tampered with, the original baseline is fixed, and a new trusted baseline can never be established if tests at new parameters are required. In this work, we extend our anti-tamper fuzz testing concept to multiple detector units, such that the downrange detector can be compared against a trusted or `golden copy' detector, even despite normal inter-detector manufacturing variations. We show using three NaI detectors that this inter-detector differential fuzz testing can detect a representative attack, even when the tested and golden copy detectors are from different manufacturers and have different performances. Here, detecting tampering requires visualizing the comparison metric vs. the parameter values and not just the sample number; moreover this baseline is non-linear and may require anomaly detection methods more complex than a simple threshold. Overall, this extension to multiple detectors improves prospects for operationalizing the technique in real-world treaty verification and safeguards contexts."}

Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations."}

We reach the conclusion that solutions which violate the radial and lateral null energy condition in the context of general relativity may still adhere to the energy conditions within the realm of $f(Q,T)$ gravity.

Furthermore, these spinning objects are slightly deformed and are no longer perfect spheres because of hydrostatic equilibrium. The well-known Kerr solution of the Einstein Field Equations (EFE) represents the spacetime surrounding a rotating spherical gravitational source. However, real objects deviate from a perfect sphere and may be prolate or oblate. There are several solutions of the EFE that represent the spacetime of deformed objects. The Kerr--like (KL) metric represents the spacetime surrounding this kind of object, where the deformation is characterized by the mass quadrupole moment parameter $q_{\\mathrm{KL}}$. When $q_{\\mathrm{KL}} \\neq 0$, the Carter constant no longer exists and the equations of motion (EOM) are no longer integrable; therefore, the system exhibits chaotic orbits. Another widely used solution is the Hartle--Thorne (HT) metric, which has similar characteristics and represents a slightly deformed, slowly rotating star. The HT metric has several versions, and two of them were selected to test their validity. The traditional HT version, which contains logarithmic terms, is less accurate than the version with exponential terms. Moreover, both the KL and HT metrics may be extended to include contributions due to the magnetic dipole moment of the source. The equations of motion (EOM) were computed, and these new dynamical systems display several interesting features, which are shown in their Poincar'e sections."}

For time-like geodesics, the maximum correction is the Planck length, which disappears when the classical separation vanishes. The light-like geodesics do not exhibit quantum corrections, meaning that the causal light cone remains the same in both classical and quantum frameworks under certain conditions. The quantum corrections for space-like geodesics impose a minimum on space-like separation, potentially playing a role in removing singularities by preventing null congruences from being closer than the Planck length.

The TT framework enables simulations at discretizations that might otherwise be computationally infeasible on conventional hardware. We show that solutions to certain multigroup problems possess an intrinsic low-rank structure, which the TT representation leverages effectively. This enables us to solve problems where the discretized solution size exceeds a trillion parameters on a single node. We consistently achieve compression factors $>$100$\\times$ and speedups $>$2$\\times$. The solver is evaluated across a range of test problems with varying levels of complexity. In addition, we further analyze the low-rank structure of the merged spatio-spectral core to evaluate the potential for additional compression via more advanced TT decompositions."}

From an experimental point of view, it is important to test the Local Lorentz Invariance with ever greater precision and in all contexts, regardless of the theoretical motivation for the possible violation. In this paper we discuss some aspects of the gravitational sector. Tests of Lorentz Invariance in the context of gravity are difficult and rare in the literature. Possible violations could arise from quantum physics applied to gravity or the presence of vector and tensor fields mediating the gravitational interaction together with the metric tensor of General Relativity. We present our results in the latter case. We analyzed the orbit of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites over a period of almost three decades. The effects of the possible preferred frame represented by the cosmic microwave background radiation on the mean argument of latitude of the satellites orbit were considered. These effects would manifest themselves mainly through the post-Newtonian parameter $α_1$, a parameter that has a null value in General Relativity. We constrain this parameterized post-Newtonian parameter down to the level of $α_1 \\le 2\\times10^{-5}$, improving a previous limit obtained through the Lunar Laser Ranging technique."}

Their performance is, however, limited by radiation induced degradation of the gain layer, primarily driven by acceptor removal. This study presents a systematic comparison of how the degradation evolves with different incident proton energies, using LGADs from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and The Institute of Microelectronics of Barcelona (IMB-CNM) irradiated with 18 MeV, 24 MeV, 400 MeV and 23 GeV protons and fluences up to 2.5x10^15 p/cm2. Electrical characterization is used to extract the acceptor removal coefficients for different proton energies, whereas IR TCT measurements offer complementary insight into the gain evolution in LGADs after irradiation. Across all devices, lower energy protons induce stronger gain layer degradation, confirming expectations. However, 400 MeV protons consistently appear less damaging than both lower and higher energy protons, an unexpected deviation from a monotonic energy trend. Conversion of proton fluences to 1 MeV neutron-equivalent fluences reduces but does not eliminate these differences, indicating that the standard Non-Ionizing Energy Loss (NIEL) scaling does not fully account for the underlying defect formation mechanisms at different energies and requires revision when considering irradiation fields that contain a broader spectrum of particle types and energies."}

In this Letter, we introduce a framework that incorporates gradient corrections into the $δN$ formalism at a desired order by adding an effective source term to the background Klein--Gordon equation. This approach allows for a nonlinear treatment of curvature perturbations at the end of inflation considering initial conditions at the time of horizon exit. By computing the equilateral non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we demonstrate that our method captures essential features missed by the standard $δN$, offering a simple yet rigorous pathway to determine nonlinear evolution expected from cosmological perturbation theory."}

We construct realistic Roman position uncertainties as a function of filter, magnitude, and exposure time, which are combined with Gaia precisions and user-defined Roman observing strategies to predict the expected uncertainty in position, parallax, and proper motion (PM). We also simulate the core Roman surveys to assess their end-of-mission astrometric capabilities, finding that the High Latitude and Galactic Bulge Time Domain Surveys will deliver Gaia-DR3-quality PMs down to G=26.5 mag and G=29.0 mag, respectively. Due to its modest number of repeat observations, we find that the astrometry of the High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS) is very sensitive to particular choices in observing strategies. We compare possible HLWAS strategies to highlight the impact of parallax effects and conclude that a multi-year Roman-only baseline is required for useful PM uncertainties (<100 mas/yr). This simulation tool is actively being used for ongoing Roman proposal writing to ensure astrometric requirements for science goals will be met. Subsequent work will expand this tool to include simulated observations from other telescopes to plan for a future where all surveys and datasets are harnessed together."}

All tripartite steering types were classified,comprising three \"1 to 2\" and three \"2 to 1\" steering cases. Through a systematic analysis of all physically relevant scenarios (including accessible and inaccessible modes), we classify three canonical scenarios with one, two and three physically accessible modes. In the scenario of three physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation disrupts quantum steering, with the maximum steering asymmetry during the two-way steering to one-way steering transition precisely demarcating the phase boundary between these regimes. For two physically accessible modes, Hawking radiation exhibits dual behavior: enhancing the steering from Alice and Bob to anti-Charlie under certain parameters while suppressing it under others, while net strengthening other steering types. When considering one physically accessible mode, the Hawking effect of the black hole significantly enhances quantum steering. These findings provide new insights into quantum correlations in curved spacetime and establish observable signatures of Hawking effects in quantum steering phenomena."}

The LPDAs are arranged in a checkerboard layout, with opposite pairs combined to enable dual-polarised operation. A diamond-shaped (tilted square) array configuration was chosen to achieve high sidelobe suppression in the East-West and North-South directions. The tile measures 5.9 meters by 5.9 meters, with diagonals along both the North-South and East-West directions, each measuring about 8.4 meters. The LPDA array with one diamond-shaped tile has been fully commissioned and is operating in transit-observing mode, successfully detecting strong pulsars and solar flares over the last seven months. The present digital backend restricts the instantaneous bandwidth for observations to 16 MHz. The array operations are streamlined to facilitate remote operations. Apart from investigating Pulsar and Solar phenomena at low radio frequencies in selected sources, this work aims to provide a training platform for radio astronomy through simple-to-construct, low-cost radio telescopes. In this paper, we present details of the array, including antenna and array response studies, brief descriptions of front-end and backend instrumentation, and illustrative results from observations of both pulsars and solar flares.

The array consists of 32 off-axis dual-polarised LPDAs, with a nominal gain of 22 dBi between 130 and 350 MHz and a 15-degree HPBW at 175 MHz for transit observations on pulsars. Custom-built receivers and real-time data-capture and analysis tools have been developed and used. Receiver output voltages from a transient buffer, as well as full-polar spectral data at both high and low resolutions, suitable for transient searches and pulsar studies. Additionally, full-polar folded profile archives are generated for known pulsars in subintegrations and both coherent and incoherent dedispersion. Custom-developed Python routines, FFT libraries, DSPSR, PSRCHIVE, and Presto modules have been used to build the pipeline. The functionalities of the pipeline were validated with artificially generated pulsar signals and strong celestial sources before it was released for routine observations. Presently, the pipeline is configured to observe pulsars between 170 and 196 MHz, with a daily cadence. Recorded data are reduced in-line immediately following each observation, nearly matching the observation time at a 1:1 ratio. An Intel i9 server captures the data, and an AMD R9 CPU does the primary data reduction. The archives are routinely backed up to a remote system via the internet.

However, observations of Galactic H$α$ emission are contaminated by geocoronal H$α$ emission. The latter is known to depend on the shadow altitude, a geometric parameter relating the line of sight to Earth's shadow cone. Using fibres on blank skys from the SDSS-IV/MaStar survey, we established an empirical relation between the geocoronal H$α$ emission and the shadow altitude, with a root mean square fractional scatter of 23.52$\\%$. This relation can be used to predict geocoronal H$α$ emission so that it can be removed from observed spectra. This removal method is advantageous when the observed targets are extensive in the sky, and it does not require a large velocity separation between the observed target and the local standard of rest. This will enable reliable studies of Galactic H$α$ in intermediate spectral resolution integral field spectroscopic surveys. We also find tentative evidences for the dependences of geocoronal emission on solar activity and the distance between the Earth and the Sun."}

Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \\times 10^4$.

We study the system of differential equations at the linear level, and show that the principal symbol has a sector with imaginary eigenvalues, which renders the system not hyperbolic. This situation persists by taking spatial derivatives in either one or three coordinate directions, and it should be interpreted as a problem of the specific gauge choice instead of a general problem with TEGR. The first practical use of Hamilton's equations in this work can be extended for proving well-posedness in spherical symmetry, and establish numerical relativity setups in TEGR."}

To fully exploit the scientific potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, researchers need a tool capable of rapidly compiling and contextualizing essential information for every new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.\n  Astro-COLIBRI is a comprehensive platform that combines a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly interfaces including a website and mobile app for iOS and Android. It ingests alerts from multiple sources in real time, applies user-defined filters, and situates each event within its multi-messenger and multi-wavelength context. The platform provides clear data visualization, concise summaries of key event properties, and evaluations of observing conditions across a wide network of observatories worldwide. We here detail the architecture of Astro-COLIBRI, from the data pipelines that manage real-time alert ingestion and processing to the design of the RESTful API, which enables seamless integration with other astronomical software and services."}

This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters.

Although they do not respond to light, the reference pixels electronically mimic normal pixels and track correlated read noise.

Simple Improved Reference Subtraction (SIRS) works with common detector clocking patterns and, when applicable, relies only on post-processing existing data so long as the reference pixels are available. The resulting reference correction is optimal, in a least squares sense, when the embedded reference pixels are the only references and the reference columns on the left and right are treated as two reference streams. We demonstrate SIRS using H4RG ground test data from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Project. The Julia language SIRS software is freely available for download from the NASA GitHub.

In a recent article, the first author demonstrated the existence of developments corresponding to a geometric notion of initial data on a big bang singularity. Moreover, this article, combined with previous articles by the second author, gives a unified and geometric perspective on large classes of seemingly disparate results in the first two categories. Concerning the third category, Oude Groeniger et al recently formulated a general condition on initial data ensuring big bang formation, including curvature blow up. This result, among other things, generalises previous results on stable big bang formation. However, it does not include a statement saying that the solutions induce initial data on the singularity. Here we tie all three categories of results together by demonstrating that the solutions of Oude Groeniger et al induce data on the singularity. However, the results are more general and can potentially be used to derive similar conclusions in other gauges."}

Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations."}

This is effective in simulating the interaction of light with telescope mirrors and lenses. We use a full electromagnetic solution to simulate the wavelength and angular dependence at surfaces. This includes bare interfaces, monolayer interfaces, protected layer coatings, and multilayer coatings. We handle special cases when multilayer data is incomplete or when there is photo-conversion in the interface as with sensors. We implement interactions with surface micro-roughness and predict the corresponding angular distribution using a Monte Carlo implementation of the Harvey-Shack scatter theory for a microroughness power spectrum. Finally, we simulate surface interaction with contamination from dust or condensation using Mie scattering applied efficiently to individual contaminants. The combination of these implementations can efficiently simulate rough to polished surfaces of arbitrary materials that are fully cleaned or dusty. The observational consequences includes complex wavelength and spatial-dependent photometric errors, the dominant effect of the wings of point-spread-functions, dust rings, and wavelength and angle-dependent throughput losses. We find agreement with the point-spread-function wings of WIYN ODI observations of bright stars and properties of dust rings, and demonstrate the ability to disentangle mirror microroughness from the turbulence PSF patterns. The comprehensive numerical implementation of surface interactions has wide applicability in non-astronomical applications as well."}

Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector.

Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \\times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets.

DarkNESS will operate in low-Earth orbit, where trapped protons induce displacement damage in the sensor that increases charge-transfer inefficiency and degrades the X-ray energy resolution.
