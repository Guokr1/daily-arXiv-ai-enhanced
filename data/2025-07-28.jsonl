Still, it has a performance\nthat is highly sensitive to spectral bandwidth and tilt aberrations.\nNevertheless, for the 1DDLC, wavelengths other than the design wavelength\nintroduce leaks with a flat wavefront on the Lyot-stop plane, preserving the\nsame complex amplitude profile as an on-axis point source. This property\nsupports the concept of serially coupling additional nullers after the 1DDLC.\nThe fiber-nulling unit employs a Lyot-plane mask, relay optics (1/100$\\times$),\nand a single-mode fiber. The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam --\ncomprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so\nthat, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the\non-axis leak from the 1DDLC.

One of ARVE's unique\nfeatures is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes\nsynthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently\nperform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a\nclass-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between\nfour subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the\nother subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data,\nand extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes\nthe stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets,\nwhich performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers\ninjection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection\nlimits. Results. Demonstrations of ARVE are performed on three years of HARPS-N\nsolar data. We show the evolution of granulation and supergranulation\ncharacteristic timescales with activity level, and we investigate the\ndifferences in planetary period-mass detection limits when extracting RVs with\ndifferent methods. Conclusions. As stellar activity mitigation techniques grow\nmore diverse, we foresee that a tool like ARVE could greatly benefit the\ncommunity by offering a user-friendly and multi-functional approach to extract\nand analyze RV time series. With its current code structure, expanded\nfunctionality and increased compatibility with more spectrographs should be\neasily addable to future versions of ARVE."}

In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial\noscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky\ngravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact\nstellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory\ncauses the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in\ncontrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static\nexterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental\nfrequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling\nconstant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the\ntransition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the\nmaximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity.

As\na first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic\nsimulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar\nfield background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion\nacting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation,\nvelocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not\na simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion\nmodifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities.
