### [1] [Periodically Poled Piezoelectric Lithium Niobate Resonator for Piezoelectric Power Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09407)
*Ziqian Yao,Clarissa Daniel,Lezli Matto,Heather Chang,Vakhtang Chuluhadze,Michael Liao,Jack Kramer,Eric Stolt,Mark S. Goorsky,Juan Rivas-Davila,Ruochen Lu*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新型的周期性极化压电薄膜（P3F）厚度扩展型（TE）铌酸锂（LN）谐振器，用于高效功率转换，具有高频率、高耦合系数和高品质因数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对紧凑高效功率转换系统需求的增加，压电功率转换器因其能够替代笨重的磁性电感器而受到关注。铌酸锂因其高优值（FoM）成为理想材料，但单层LN谐振器的工作频率较低。P3F结构有望同时提高工作频率和FoM。

Method: 研究提出了一种P3F TE LN谐振器，工作在19.23 MHz，具有29%的高耦合系数和3187的高品质因数。通过高功率测试程序，系统研究了其非线性行为和功率处理能力。

Result: 该谐振器实现了压电功率谐振器中最先进的（fs·Q）乘积，展示了在高功率和高频率功率转换中的潜力。

Conclusion: P3F TE谐振器通过进一步优化，有望为高功率和高频率功率转换开辟新的设计空间。

Abstract: As the demand for compact and efficient power conversion systems increases,
piezoelectric power converters have gained attention for their ability to
replace bulky magnetic inductors with acoustic resonators, enabling higher
power density and improved efficiency. Achieving optimal converter performance
requires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical
coupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response.
Lithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to
its high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \cdot k^2$). While previous studies on
single-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically
operate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically
poled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric
layers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both
scale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer
counterparts in piezoelectric power conversion. This work presents the first
P3F thickness-extensional (TE) LN resonator for power conversion, operating at
19.23 MHz, with a large \textit{$k^2$} of 29\% and a high \textit{Q} of 3187,
achieving a state-of-the-art (\textit{ $f_s \cdot Q$}) product among
piezoelectric power resonators. A high-power testing procedure is performed to
systematically study the nonlinear behavior and power handling of P3F LN for
power applications. With further optimization, P3F TE resonators have the
potential to open up a new design space for high-power and high-frequency power
conversion.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$
in the vicinity of its second-order magnetoelastic transition at $T_ {\rm c} =
173$ K. The critical exponents (CEs) $\beta$ and $\gamma$, determined using
both the standard convergence procedure and the average normalized slope (ANS)
method, diverge at $T_{\rm c}$: a characteristic typically associated with
first-order transitions. Notably, none of the established universality classes
satisfactorily describe the critical behavior of Sm$_7$Pd$_3$, and we discuss
the possible origins of this deviation in the context of the strong
spin-lattice coupling intrinsic to the sample. We emphasize the importance of
accurately selecting the critical temperature and magnetic field ranges to
ensure robust critical behavior analysis and propose a quantitative approach to
assess the reliability of the extracted CEs. Additionally, we demonstrate that
in the ANS method, the critical exponents $\beta$ and $\gamma$ should be
calculated separately using data for $T \leqslant T_{\rm c}$ and $T \geqslant
T_{\rm c}$, respectively. Our findings underscore the need for a revised
theoretical framework to accurately describe second-order magnetoelastic
transitions.

Abstract: Building on the feasibility study in CERN-PBC Report-2018-002 (Arduini et al.
2018), this report supported by the Physics Beyond Colliders (PBC) Study Group
describes the technical implementation of modifications to the PX46 shaft at
LHC Point 4 during LS3 (June 2026 - June 2030) that would enable it to
accommodate the installation and operation of a vertical long-baseline Atom
Interferometer during Run 4 without affecting LHC operations. We specify in
detail the necessary civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation
shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and design
of a mobile elevator platform. Our comprehensive technical assessment
identifies no fundamental obstacles or showstoppers to implementation. Refined
cost estimates and a critical-path schedule confirm that, from formal approval,
all interventions can be completed within a 1.5-year window. These preparations
would ensure seamless, concurrent operation of the Atom Interferometer
experiment and the HL-LHC, with all technical challenges successfully addressed
through established engineering solutions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过月球环境突破地球电离层限制，利用低频无线电信号探测系外行星磁场，以评估其宜居性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接约束系外行星磁场对理解其性质和宜居性至关重要，但地面观测因电离层限制难以实现低频信号探测。

Method: 利用月球环境（如LuSEE-Night和ROLSES任务）及未来月球阵列（FarView和FARSIDE）进行低频无线电观测。

Result: 月球观测将首次提供低于10 MHz的系外行星无线电通量上限，并可能探测到邻近类地行星的磁层。

Conclusion: 月球无线电天文学将开辟低频窗口，彻底改变系外行星磁层科学领域。

Abstract: Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave,
and evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly
constrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets
including their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020
Decadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is
among the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet
to yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from
ground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are
fundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency
signals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In
this white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing
the unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and
ROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet
analogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux
below 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the
proposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be
sensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets
(super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like
planets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo
theory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres
of nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric
characterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential
habitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy
from the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric
science. [Abridged]

### [5] [Jitter Sensing and Control for Multi-Plane Phase Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09256)
*Caleb G. Abbott,Justin R. Crepp,Brian Sands*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 多平面相位检索传感器（如非线性曲率波前传感器）的信号中嵌入了倾斜/倾斜信息。通过快速质心算法和测量平面距离知识，实验证明仅用波前传感器即可感知和补偿图像抖动，无需额外组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多平面相位检索传感器中倾斜/倾斜信息的提取能力，验证其独立补偿图像抖动的可行性。

Method: 构建非线性曲率波前传感器，结合快速质心算法和测量平面距离知识，测试波前重建方法。

Result: 实验证实仅用波前传感器即可精确补偿图像抖动，验证了数值模拟结果。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了多平面相位检索传感器的重建精度，适用于高阶空间模式。

Abstract: The family of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors, such as the curvature and
nonlinear curvature wavefront sensors (WFS), contain tip/tilt information
embedded in their signals. We have built a nonlinear curvature WFS to study
different wavefront reconstruction methods and test the ability to extract
tip/tilt information. Using reliable and fast centroiding algorithms, combined
with knowledge of the measured z-distance to each measurement plane, we
demonstrate that image jitter may be sensed and compensated for using a fast
steering mirror and the WFS alone, i.e. without the need for peripheral
components such as quad-cells or access to a separate scientific imaging
channel. This approach, which is both precise and accurate, corroborates
previous numerical simulations and is expected to improve the overall
reconstruction accuracy of multi-plane phase retrieval sensors including higher
order spatial modes.

### [6] [GPU accelerated MHD in the DISPATCH framework using directive-based programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09568)
*Michael Haahr,Troels Haugbølle,Åke Nordlund,Sven Karlsson,Eloi Martaillé Richard*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于OpenMP目标卸载的GPU加速磁流体动力学（MHD）求解器，集成到DISPATCH框架中，通过分组更新减少GPU内核启动开销，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过GPU加速提升天体物理代码的性能，同时保持可移植性和准确性。

Method: 采用OpenMP目标卸载技术，将计算域组织为异步更新的补丁组（bunches），以减少GPU内核启动开销。

Result: 在独立测试中，GPU比CPU快7.3倍；在完整框架中，GPU比12个CPU核心快9.8倍，核心MHD更新速度比单个CPU核心快两个数量级。

Conclusion: OpenMP卸载技术能显著提升天体物理代码性能，同时保持可移植性和准确性，为未来代码设计提供了参考。

Abstract: We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
solver using directive-based programming with OpenMP target offloading. The
solver is integrated into the DISPATCH framework, which organises the
computational domain into a collection of asynchronously updated patches. To
reduce GPU kernel launch overhead, patches are grouped into "bunches" that are
updated collectively. While porting the particular solver required a complete
code refactoring, it yielded performance gains on both GPU and CPU. A
stand-alone mini-app achieved a 7.3x speed-up compared to a single NVIDIA A100
GPU to seven AMD 7F72 Rome CPU cores. Within the full DISPATCH framework, the
GPU-accelerated MHD Bunch solver showed excellent agreement with the CPU-based
reference implementation on standard test problems such as the Sod shock tube
and Orszag-Tang vortex. In large-scale 3D tests, the GPU implementation
achieved a 9.8x overall speedup, comparing one GPU to 12 CPU cores, with the
core MHD update routine being two orders of magnitude faster on the GPU than on
a single CPU core. These results demonstrate that OpenMP offloading can provide
substantial performance improvements for astrophysical codes while maintaining
portability and accuracy. The work also demonstrates how new codes should be
structured to allow simple and efficient directive-based GPU offloading.

### [7] [Radial Pulsations in Polaris: A Secondary Science Application of Cherenkov Telescopes via Intensity Interferometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09742)
*Km Nitu Rai,Prasenjit Saha,Subrata Sarangi*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 利用切伦科夫望远镜进行强度干涉测量，可在月夜期间实现高分辨率光学天文观测，并精确测量恒星参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 切伦科夫望远镜在月夜期间通常无法用于伽马射线观测，但通过强度干涉测量技术，可将其用于光学恒星测量，提升科学价值。

Method: 通过模拟，利用单望远镜或多望远镜系统，将光子像素映射到孔径的不同区域，生成多个基线，增强观测平面覆盖。

Result: 模拟结果表明，该方法可用于精确测量径向脉动恒星（如北极星）的参数，并展示了切伦科夫望远镜在光学天文中的潜力。

Conclusion: 切伦科夫望远镜在非运行期间可用于高分辨率光学天文观测，为恒星表征提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, although typically inoperative during
moonlit nights for gamma-ray observations, offer a valuable opportunity for
secondary scientific applications through Intensity Interferometry (II). Recent
developments and observations suggest that implementing II instrumentation on
existing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) or the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) can significantly advance optical stellar measurements.
Motivated by the resurgence of II efforts over the past two decades, this work
presents simulations demonstrating the estimation of stellar parameters for a
radially pulsating star, such as Polaris, using either a single telescope or
multiple telescopes. For single-telescope simulations, we assume that the
photon pixels in the camera are mapped onto four distinct regions of the
aperture, generating multiple baselines and enabling enhanced observational
plane coverage. These results highlight the potential of Cherenkov telescopes
in India for high-resolution optical astronomy during otherwise inoperative
periods and offer promising insights into the characterization of bright
stellar objects with unprecedented precision.

Abstract: Astronomical surveys and the growing involvement of amateur astronomers are
producing more sky images than ever before, and this calls for automated
processing methods that are accurate and robust. Detecting Deep Sky Objects --
such as galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters -- remains challenging because of
their faint signals and complex backgrounds. Advances in Computer Vision and
Deep Learning now make it possible to improve and automate this process. In
this paper, we present the training and comparison of different detection
models (YOLO, RET-DETR) on smart telescope images, using High-Performance
Computing (HPC) to parallelise computations, in particular for robustness
testing.

Motivation: 地面近红外天文观测需要高稳定性的多通道FBG滤波器，尤其是在非温控环境中。

Method: 设计并测试了一种自补偿封装，包含三个10 mm滤波器光栅和一个参考光栅，进行了三次热循环测试。

Result: 在-17°C至15°C范围内，最大波长偏差为12 pm，波长漂移仅为0.37 pm/°C，补偿效果显著。

Conclusion: 该原型展示了在非温控环境中稳定多通道FBG的潜力，适用于需要亚皮米稳定性的天文应用。

Abstract: Multi-channel aperiodic fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based hydroxyl (OH) line
filters have attracted significant interest in ground-based near-infrared (NIR)
astronomical observations. In this paper, we present the performance of a new
self-compensating enclosure for the filters, that can be used in
non-temperature-controlled environments. Our prototype encloses a 110 mm long
single-mode photosensitive optical fiber with three 10 mm filter gratings. A
fourth grating was used as a reference outside the package to measure the
uncompensated wavelength shift. The prototype was tested over three thermal
cycles, and showed a maximum wavelength deviation of 12 pm, a wavelength drift
of only 0.37 pm/$^{\circ}$C, over the temperature range of -17$^{\circ}$C to
15$^{\circ}$C. The athermalization factor, i.e., the ratio of the maximum
wavelength shift of the compensated grating to the uncompensated reference
filter grating was $\frac{1}{22}$. The results demonstrate the capability of
the prototype for stabilizing multi-channel long-length FBGs or chirped FBGs,
particularly for astronomical applications that require sub-picometer
stability.

### [10] [Study on deflection angle, shadow, quasinormal modes, and greybody factor of the black hole surrounded by quintessence in Rastall gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09221)
*Susmita Sarkar,Nayan Sarkar,Tuhina Manna,Moumita Sarkar,Farook Rahaman*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了Rastall引力中带电荷黑洞在quintessence场下的弱场偏转角、阴影、准正规模和灰体因子的下界。发现偏转角随电荷Q和黑洞质量m变化，且quintessence场增大了偏转角。阴影随Q增大而缩小，随m增大而扩大。准正规模与Lyapunov指数相关，灰体因子随Q减小而随m增大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Rastall引力中带电荷黑洞在quintessence场下的物理特性，包括偏转角、阴影、准正规模和灰体因子，以揭示其与经典黑洞模型的差异。

Method: 使用Gauss-Bonnet方法计算弱场偏转角，分析光子球和阴影，推导Lyapunov指数和准正规频率，并计算灰体因子的下界。

Result: 偏转角随Q减小、m增大；阴影随Q缩小、m扩大；准正规模与Lyapunov指数相关；灰体因子随Q减小、m增大。

Conclusion: Rastall引力中的quintessence场显著影响黑洞物理特性，结果在特定条件下退化为Reissner-Nordstrom或Schwarzschild黑洞。

Abstract: The present study focuses on investigating the deflection angle in the
weak-field approximation, shadow, quasinormal modes using Lyapunov exponents,
and lower bound of the greybody factor for a charged black hole surrounded by a
quintessence field in Rastall gravity. The weak deflection angles are
calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact
parameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole
mass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall
gravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow
of the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink
as Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal
modes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov
exponent {\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\omega}. In the eikonal
limit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the
quasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale
of the unstable null circular geodesics. Additionally, we derive the lower
bounds of the greybody factor Gb; it decreases for increasing charge Q, while
the increasing mass m enhances it. Importantly, all the findings reduce to
those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for Nq=0 and to the Schwarzschild
black hole for Nq=Q=0.

Method: 从能量-动量张量守恒出发，推导连续性方程和欧拉方程，进而得到扰动MCG宇宙学方程，最终得到物质涨落增长方程。

Result: MCG在高红移时增强结构形成，低红移时抑制，与ΛCDM模型不同。

Conclusion: MCG对宇宙结构形成的影响具有红移依赖性，与ΛCDM模型形成对比。

Abstract: We study the evolution of matter density perturbations in the framework of
massive conformal gravity (MCG). Starting from the conservation of the
energy-momentum tensor, we find the continuity and Euler equations for the
conformal perfect fluid that fills the MCG universe. We then obtain the
perturbed MCG cosmological equations, from which we derive the equation that
determines the growth of matter fluctuations in the MCG universe. The resulting
growth equation shows that MCG enhances cosmic structure formation at high
redshifts and suppresses it at low redshifts when compared to the {\Lambda}CDM
cosmological model.

Result: 引力波的偏振可视为纯扭转状态，且空间性质在测量点存在各向异性。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何扭转和塑性晶体学，可以重建一个完整的三维环境。

Abstract: In this study, the authors employ the analogy between continuum mechanics and
general relativity to investigate, from the perspective of elasticity and
crystal plasticity, the deformations of space measured by LIGO/VIRGO
interferometers during the passage of gravitational waves over Earth. The
results of different innovative or existing mechanical models are compared with
each other and compared with the observations in the framework of general
relativity and Einstein-Cartan theory. Despite limitations, there is a
convergence of results: the polarizations of gravitational waves can be viewed
as expressions of an equivalent elastic media deformation tensor. Additionally,
an anisotropy of space properties is unavoidable at the measurement point of
the gravitational wave if we rely on the current first-order general
relativity, which predict that gravitational waves generate deformations only
in transverse planes. It is demonstrated that the classical polarizations of
general relativity can be associated with a state of pure torsion in the
analogous elastic medium and acted upon by the rotation of massive bodies such
as black holes. This approach involves a transverse isotropic medium composed
of independent sheets that deform perpendicularly to the direction of
propagation of these waves. Considering geometric torsion in general
relativity, associated with plastic crystallography, allows for the examination
of complementary polarizations in the direction of wave propagation. This makes
it possible to connect these sheets and reconstruct a complete, coherent 3D
environment.

Result: 模型在87个LIGO-Virgo-Kagra事件中表现出与GWTC报告距离的一致性。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为现有贝叶斯参数估计流程的补充，提供快速初步距离估算。

Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) provide a powerful means for cosmological distance
estimation, circumventing the systematic uncertainties associated with
traditional electromagnetic (EM) indicators. This work presents a model for
estimating distances to binary black hole (BBH) mergers using only GW data,
independent of EM counterparts or galaxy catalogs. By utilizing the intrinsic
properties of the GW signal, specifically the strain amplitude and merger
frequency, our model offers a computationally efficient preliminary distance
estimation approach that could complements existing Bayesian parameter
estimation pipelines. In this work, we examine a simplified analytical
expression for the GW luminosity distance derived from General Relativity (GR),
based on the leading-order quadrupole approximation. Without incorporating
post-Newtonian (PN) or numerical relativity (NR) corrections, or modeling spin,
eccentricity, or inclination, we test how closely this expression can reproduce
distances reported by full Bayesian inference pipelines. We apply our model to
87 events from the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) Gravitational Wave Transient
Catalogues (GWTC), computing distances for these sources. Our results
demonstrate consistent agreement with GWTC-reported distances, further
supported by graphical comparisons that highlight the model's performance
across multiple events.

Abstract: This study investigates the modeling of anisotropic magnetized static neutron
stars within the framework of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (5D EGB)
gravity. While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine
neutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations
in accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in
predicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response,
this research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in
characterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action
and incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical
relevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of
five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study,
thereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under
extreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the
AV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and
pressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its
trace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift
function, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds.
Additionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are
examined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific
values of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the
model. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational
collapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the
proposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl
inequality is satisfied as well.

Abstract: We present a unified dynamical systems framework for spatially flat FLRW
cosmology in $f(Q)$ gravity, covering all three connection branches via a
single set of Hubble-normalised variables without fixing $f(Q)$ \textit{a
priori}. This connection-agnostic, model-independent approach enables direct
comparison across branches and reveals generic structural features that are not
apparent in model or connection-specific analyses. Beyond fixed points, we
identify invariant submanifolds, model-independent trajectories, and viable
phase-space regions common to multiple branches. For a broad class of viable
$f(Q)$ models, we find generic de Sitter attractors and matter-dominated points
in non-coincident branches, ensuring late-time acceleration without
fine-tuning. An invariant submanifold is shown to reproduce $\Lambda$CDM-like
backgrounds despite dynamics distinct from GR, offering a geometric origin for
cosmic acceleration detectable only at the perturbation level. On this
submanifold, a first integral enables analytic reconstruction of the dynamical
connection and uncovers hidden conservation laws. While trivial connections
display strong parameter dependence, nontrivial branches often exhibit
parameter-independent behaviour. We also analyse the variation of the effective
gravitational coupling $\kappa_{\text{eff}}=\frac{1}{f_Q}$ across branches,
providing observational constraints that bridge theory and data. Applying the
framework to $f(Q)=\alpha Q+\beta(-Q)^n$, we recover late-time acceleration and
$\Lambda$CDM-like behaviour without vacuum energy. Finally, we propose a
general route for extending dynamical systems analysis to broader classes of
$f(Q)$ models using the $m_i$-hierarchy method, which enables closure of the
autonomous system for models previously inaccessible to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Superradiance enables scalar fields to extract energy and angular momentum
from a rotating black hole (BH), leading to the formation of a BH-condensate
system. The condensate appears to exhibit global rotation as a rigid body, with
phase propagation occurring only in the azimuthal direction, such a picture
leads to unphysical superluminal velocities at large distances. In this work,
we demonstrate that the apparent rotation is a collective effect arising from
local radial, polar, and azimuthal motions. In the region sufficiently far from
the BH, the condensate exhibits a radial velocity magnitude that approaches $
(r_g\mu/\bar{n}) \sin (2\omega t-2 \varphi)$, while the polar and azimuthal
velocity magnitudes asymptotically decline as $\propto 1/r$.

Abstract: There has been recently renewed interest in the quantisation of gravity by
considering local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. The main purpose of
this paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments
assuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In
addition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in
causal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like
geometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is
a three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and
future corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum
theory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that
factorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and
its two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and
boundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we
explain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states
according to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the
resulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge
conservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and
discussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our
proposal in practice.

Abstract: We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based
on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under
perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the
string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic
evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a
perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a
second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an
enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the
way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)
- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the
string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the
Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string
coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In
turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and
initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition
into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic
singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and
robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of
primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.

Motivation: 研究ΛCDM模型是否为宇宙演化的最佳标准模型，通过比较运动学和动力学描述的等价性。

Method: 通过两个具体例子分析几乎ΛCDM膨胀历史（j(z)≈1）是否对应几乎ΛCDM模型（w_DE(z)≈-1）。

Result: 研究发现几乎ΛCDM宇宙演化对应几乎统一的暗流体模型，而非几乎ΛCDM模型。

Conclusion: 由于无法从宇宙学数据集中获得精确的j(z)=1条件，ΛCDM模型作为宇宙演化标准模型的地位受到质疑。

Abstract: In this communication we address whether or not there is an equivalence
between the kinematical and dynamical descriptions of the spatially flat
$\Lambda$CDM model. We address this by investigating whether an almost
$\Lambda$CDM expansion history ($j(z)\approx1$) corresponds to an almost
$\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\rm DE}(z)\approx-1$) by considering two particular
explicit examples. At least for the cases considered, this turns out not to be
the case. Instead, what we find is that an almost $\Lambda$CDM cosmic evolution
rather corresponds to an \emph{almost unified dark fluid model}. Considering
that one never gets the exact condition $j(z)=1$ from any cosmographic data
sets, this raises further questions on whether the $\Lambda$CDM model is the
best candidate for the standard model of the evolution of the universe.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around
the Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity.
We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the
photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein
ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr
A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing
observables and compare with the observables associated with the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of
massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m-de Sitter-like
(RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and
imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the
damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it
has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the
detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on
the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody
factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability
of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the
increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of
Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed
graphically.

Conclusion: 本文成功构建了boosted Kerr-Newman黑洞的近似解，揭示了其独特的时空和电磁场特性，为相关研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: In this paper we obtain an approximate solution of Einstein field equations
which describes a general boosted Kerr-Newman black hole relative to a Lorentz
frame at future null infinity. The boosted black hole is obtained from a
general twisting metric whose boost emerges from the BMS group. Employing a
standard procedure we build the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor with the
Kerr boosted metric together with its timelike Killing vector as the
electromagnetic potential. We demonstrate that our solution satisfies Einstein
field equations up to a fourth-order expansion in $1/r$, indicating that the
spacetime closely resembles a Kerr-Newman black hole whose boost points in a
arbitrary direction. Spacetime structures of the general black hole -- namely
the event horizon and ergosphere -- are examined in Bondi-Sachs coordinates.
For a proper timelike observer we show that the electric field generated by the
boosted black hole exhibits a purely radial behavior, whereas the magnetic
field develops a complex structure characterized by two pronounced lobes
oriented opposite to the boost direction.
