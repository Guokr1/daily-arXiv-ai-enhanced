A technical advantage\nof MgAl2O4 is that a continuous and flat thin film is realized on a Si\nsubstrate even when the MgAl2O4 thickness is as thin as 0.5 nm, unlike MgO,\nwhich enables us to examine the spin transport in a thinner range of the tunnel\nbarrier thickness. Our distinct finding is as follows: When the Fe/Mg/MgO\ninterface is used on the top side, the spin polarization PS of tunneling\nelectrons increases at 10 K as the total MgO/MgAl2O4 tunnel barrier thickness\n(tox = 0.47 - 1.4 nm) is increased, regardless of different thickness\ncombinations, and PS shows saturation-like behavior when tox is above 1.1 nm.\nSince this feature cannot be explained by the well-known conductivity mismatch\nin semiconductor-based ferromagnetic tunnel junctions, we propose a simple\nphenomenological tunneling model based on two different direct tunneling paths,\nwhich have higher/lower spin polarizations with longer/shorter decay lengths.\nOur numerical calculation reproduces the relationship between the spin\npolarization PS and total tunnel barrier thickness tox in the experiments,\nindicating that the dominant mechanism is an increasing contribution of the\nlower spin polarization path as tox is decreased. We discuss possible origins\nfor this phenomenon including intrinsic and extrinsic tunneling mechanisms.

Pulse shapes from these detectors vary with interaction\ntopology and thus encode information critical for event classification. Pulse\nshape simulations (PSS) are essential for modeling analysis cuts that\ndistinguish signal events from backgrounds and for generating reliable\nsimulations of energy spectra. Traditional PSS methods rely on a series of\nfirst-principles corrections to replicate the effect of readout electronics,\nrequiring challenging fits over large parameter spaces and often failing to\naccurately model the data. We present a neural network architecture, the Cyclic\nPositional U-Net (CPU-Net), that performs translations of simulated pulses so\nthat they closely resemble measured detector signals. Using a Cycle Generative\nAdversarial Network (CycleGAN) framework, this Response Emulation Network (REN)\nlearns a data-driven mapping between simulated and measured pulses with high\nfidelity, without requiring a predetermined response model. We use data from a\nHigh-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector with an inverted-coaxial point contact\n(ICPC) geometry to show that CPU-Net effectively captures and reproduces\ncritical pulse shape features, allowing more realistic simulations without\ndetector-specific tuning.

The model is trained on\nbroad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths -\ngenerated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with\nderived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses\nwith respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex\nover the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's\nparameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective\npredictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a\nstrong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to\naccount for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing\nthe diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy\ndistribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally\nexpensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In\ncontrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables,\nenabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational\ncost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in\nthe data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial\nmass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine\nlearning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its\npotential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy\nsurveys."}
