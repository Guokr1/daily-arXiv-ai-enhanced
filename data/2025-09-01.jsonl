We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon\nsphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing\nobservables including the image position $\\theta_\\infty$, angular separation\n$s$ and relative magnification $r_{\\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships\nwith the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic\nimage's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing\nobservables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with\n$a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from\n$10.8~\\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two\nimages increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*,\nthe image position increases from $14.4~\\mu$as to $16~\\mu$as, with time delays\nenhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification\n$r_{\\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at\n$B=0.4$.

Modeling these systems requires evolving the\ncoupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting\nreasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself\nrelies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this\npaper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories\nshape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger\nevents. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of\ndark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been\naccreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a\ndistribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from\na vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly\nfor more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place\nwithin a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find\nthat the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior\ninspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the\nenvironmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial\ndata are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors."}

Controlling their light emission electrically\nis a crucial step towards realizing practical nanoscale optoelectronic devices\nsuch as light-emitting diodes and optical modulators. However,\nphotoluminescence (PL) quenching in van der Waals TMDC/metal heterostructures,\ncaused by ultrafast interlayer charge or energy transfer, impedes such\nelectrical modulation. Here, we investigate monolayer-MoSe2/bulk-NbSe2\nheterostructures and demonstrate that a vertical electric field can effectively\nrecover the PL intensity up to ~ 80% of bare-MoSe2. Furthermore, our analysis\nreveals that the room temperature PL intensity can be tuned by nearly three\norders of magnitude in bare-MoSe2 and by about one order of magnitude in\nMoSe2/NbSe2 heterostructures. First-principles calculations incorporating\nspin-orbit coupling reveal that the perpendicular electric fields drive a\ntransition from a direct to an indirect bandgap, fundamentally altering the\noptical response in the heterostructure. Unlike bare-MoSe2, the heterostructure\nexhibits a pronounced thermal dependence of the enhancement factor, implying\nthat exciton lifetime dominates over interfacial transfer processes. Our\nfindings demonstrate reversible, electric-field-driven PL control at a\nTMDC/metal interface, providing a pathway to electrically tunable light\nemission and improved contact engineering in two-dimensional optoelectronic\ndevices."}

Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and\nprecision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave\ndynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by\nanalyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon\nstructure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic\nfluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma\nenvironments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles\nand image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and\npower-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical\nsettings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of\nthe spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's\nmethod, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave\nequation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB\napproximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and\nexamine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we\nperform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to\nconstrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT\nand GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a\nunified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with\nlensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future\ncomparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts."}

We consider two possible scalar-GB coupling function\n$\\chi(\\phi)$, one parity-even and another parity-odd function of the scalar\nfield $\\phi$. For both choices, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet non-minimal coupling\nproduces a warped asymptotically $AdS_5$ spacetime even in the absence of a\nbulk cosmological constant. Outside the brane core, a negative cosmological\nconstant is bounded by the scalar-GB coupling function. For a thick 3-brane\nconfiguration, we found solutions with localized brane energy density and\npressure that dynamically produce a bulk cosmological constant. The\ncorresponding scalar field solutions exhibit a non-topological (domain wall)\nbehavior. In order to probe the 3-brane stability solution, we employed a\nperturbative analysis, by perturbing the thick brane solutions up to\nfirst-order. The Kaluza-Klein (KK) tensorial gravitational modes possess a\nlocalized massless mode and a tower of non-tachyonic diverging massive modes,\nwhat renders the solutions stable at least at the perturbative level."}

Pure theoretical analysis\nindicates that the leading order effect of the gravitational constant variation\ncorrects the amplitude of gravitational waves, and the second order effect\ncorrects the phase of gravitational waves. As the matched filtering technique\nis used by gravitational wave data analysis, the phase is more important than\nthe amplitude. In the current paper we use LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA data to constrain\nthe gravitational constant variation. Our findings indicate that we need to\nwait until the distance of the detected gravitational wave events and/or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio increases by $2n$ orders compared to the current\ndetection state, and then we can use phase correction to get constraint\n$|\\frac{G'}{G}|<10^{-n}$/yr for gravitational wave events without\nelectromagnetic counterparts.

In place of a wide field CCD camera in the\ninitial stage of laser link acquisition adopted in the conventional scheme, an\nextended Kalman filter based on precision orbit determination is incorporated\nin the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) to steer the laser beam in such a way\nto narrow the uncertainty cone and at the same time avoids the heating problem\ngenerated by the CCD camera.A quadrant photodetector (QPD) based on the\nDifferential Power Sensing (DPS) technique, which offers a higher dynamic range\nthan differential wavefront sensing (DWS), is employed as the readout of the\nlaser beam spot. The conventional two stages (coarse acquisition and fine\nacquisition) are integrated into a single control loop.
