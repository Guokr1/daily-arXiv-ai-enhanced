The study reveals\nthat while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other\nthermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal\nenergy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications.\nPositive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities,\nleading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while\nnegative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in\ndivergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black\nhole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields,\nproviding deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and\nthermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering\nminor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole\nbehavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions."}

We discuss some possible theoretical scenarios in which the\nrunning of $G$ and $\\Lambda$ can occur.

While indirect techniques such as\nphotometry and Doppler imaging have been studied for their ability to map\nstellar surfaces, the gold standard remains optical long-baseline\ninterferometry. In this paper, we develop new closed-form solutions for the\ninterferometric visibility of a rotating star with an arbitrary inhomogeneous\nsurface. We introduce the concept of 'stellar rotation synthesis' in\ninterferometry--an analog of Earth rotation synthesis--where stellar rotation\nadds information to the spherical harmonic modes representing the star's\nsurface intensity. We implement these solutions in the open-source package\nharmonix, written in JAX with automatic differentiation, providing a rich\necosystem for fitting and inference. Inspired by similar studies for photometry\nand Doppler imaging, we use simulations of a fiducial star as observed by the\nCHARA Array and intensity interferometers to perform a comprehensive\ntheoretical study of the information theory of the starspot mapping problem in\ninterferometry. We show that adding simultaneous photometry from a space-based\ninstrument such as TESS adds complementary spatial information to\ninterferometry and can improve the precision on the map coefficients by over an\norder of magnitude, enabling the detailed mapping of nearby main-sequence stars\nwith current facilities. Finally, we evaluate the performance of existing and\nproposed intensity interferometers for stellar surface mapping."}

For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\\odot}$, the\ntidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither\ncan the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption.\nSince NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's\nmaterial can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant\nobserver. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the\ndisrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption\nevent. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have\nimplications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such\nan event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and\nstudying the motion of matter in such a geometry.

The next generations of astrometric\nfacilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond\nastrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light\npropagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is\nindispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the\npost-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some\nsolar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light\nsource as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the\ngravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value\nproblem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by\nthe spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past\ninfinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical\nrelativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the\ndetermination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the\nspatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several\nbasic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one\nto calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar\nsystem bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for\nstellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system.\nNumerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole\nand quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the\ngiant planets.

This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors,\nsuch as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data\nacquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract\nsource properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as\nwell, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and\ncosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the\ncomplementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle\nexperiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation\ndetectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based\nmissions."}

We consider both, nondissipative and dissipative systems.\nSolutions are ranged from the simplest one, in order of increasing complexity.\nSome specific models are found and analyzed in detail."}

This mathematical structure\nconsists of a principal fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold that is\nendowed with an affine connection. The relationship between AGT and various\nformulations of teleparallel theories of gravity, which are alternatives to\nGeneral Relativity, are examined. Here, it is argued that the Affine Bundle is\nthe most natural principal fibre bundle for a gauge theory of gravity. AGT is\nalso shown to be strictly diffeomorphism invariant. In particular, an explicit\nproof of diffeomorphism invariance in AGT is given - showing that AGT possesses\nthe important symmetry of General Relativity, as would be expected from a\ntheory of gravity. Lastly, the claim that AGT is background independent, as\nGeneral Relativity is, from varying degrees of strictness in the definition of\nbackground independence is closely examined. Reasons for why a background\nindependent theory is preferred are also discussed."}

First, a review of the relationship\nbetween Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories\nare given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence\nis discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is\nfluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or\nphysicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of\nbackground independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of\ndiffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance\nbackground independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to\ndiffeomorphism invariance is discussed."}

Here we adopt a toy model previously used in\nasymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the\nover-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint\nneed not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs\nof solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and\nweak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to\nexist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can\nbe balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice.\nEven below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge\nto solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting\nguess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution."}
