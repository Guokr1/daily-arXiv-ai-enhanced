In this study, we\nevaluate the SWPC probabilistic flare forecasts over a 26-year period\n(1998-2024), comparing them to several zero-cost and statistical baselines\nincluding persistence, climatology, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. We\nfind that the SWPC model does not outperform these baselines across key\nclassification and probabilistic metrics and exhibits severe calibration issues\nand high false alarm rates, especially in high-stakes scenarios such as\ndetecting the first flare after extended quiet periods. These findings\ndemonstrate the need for more accurate and reliable eruption forecasting models\nwhich we suggest should be based on modern data-driven methods. The findings\nalso provide a standard against which any proposed eruption prediction system\nshould be compared.

The high cost of transporting\nmaterials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with\nlunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing\n(AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility,\nmaterial efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This\nstudy investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK)\ncomposites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS).

The samples were\ncharacterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing,\nand microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities\nabove 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK\nto 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation\nenhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while\nreducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and\nprint success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa\nup to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%.\nAnnealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt%\nLRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental\nanalyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith\nparticles.

Machine learning, which excels in\ndata rich environments, is particularly well suited to space-based computer\nvision applications, such as space optical attitude sensing. Of these sensors,\ndigital sun sensors (DSS) are one of the most common and important sensors for\nspacecraft attitude determination. The main challenge in using the DSS for\nattitude estimation are sensor errors, which limit the overall achievable\nestimation accuracy. However, the traditional sun sensor calibration process is\ncostly, slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. These limitations motivate the\nuse of AI techniques to enable more accurate and efficient DSS calibration.\n  The objective of this work is to develop an end-to-end predictive calibration\nmethodology for digital sun sensors to solve 2-axis state estimates utilizing a\nsparse submanifold convolutional neural network (SSCNN). We find that the\nproposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data\nwith a mean accuracy of 0.005{\\deg} for the two sun angle estimates.\nFurthermore, the model is highly capable of implicitly learning complex noise\npatterns and handling mixed noise types, thereby greatly improving the model\nrobustness and accuracy to real-world applications. The main contributions of\nthis work are: (1) the first application (to our knowledge) of a CNN regression\nmodel to the problem of DSS predictive calibration, (2) the introduction of a\nfused end-to-end training approach for DSS calibration, (3) the creation of a\npublicly available physics-informed synthetic dataset and simulation for DSS\ntraining images, and (4) the evaluation of the performance of the deep learning\napproach for various mask configurations."}

This model features a quantum-corrected metric\ntensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution.\nInvestigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected\nblack holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the\nexponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a\nsignificant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this\nterm and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the\nLorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS\nmodel and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the\nnear-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties\nwith both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the\nanti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the\ntemperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass\ndiminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior.

For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading\norder of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime\nmass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order.\nThese precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to\ndetermine their spin precession rates. For systems with observational data, our\nresults show excellent agreement. For systems without observational data, we\npredict their spin precession rates at both the leading and Lense-Thirring\neffect orders. These predictions indicate that Jupiter's satellites exhibit\nexceptionally large geodetic spin precession and their Lense-Thirring effect\nmay be detectable with current technology."}

We argue the correct analogue of\ncoordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind\nof permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes\nthe entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables\ncan be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local\ncorrelations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background\nindependent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph\nnotions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful\ncomplete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a\nreformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and\nreveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph\nisomorphism problem."}

Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring\nstructure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric\nsignatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole\nparameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the\ndeformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional\nsources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter\nregimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH\nwith a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image\nexhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon\nsphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the\nouter one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by\ngravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our\nfindings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature\nof the photon sphere structure of the central black hole."}

By incorporating a non-zero redshift function and a\ndirect coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength\ntensor, the work examines the influence of the non-minimal coupling constant\n$\\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ on the wormhole geometry. The analysis\ndemonstrates that suitable choices of these parameters can satisfy the\nflare-out and throat conditions, allowing for physically viable traversable\nwormholes without requiring exotic matter. The study further evaluates the\nArnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, showing that quantum corrections, which are\nmodeled through Euler-Heisenberg-type contributions, reduce the total\ngravitational mass and may stabilize the structure. The energy conditions are\nanalyzed, revealing localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions\nat the wormhole throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied.\nAdditionally, light deflection in the presence of the wormhole is calculated,\nindicating positive deflection angles and confirming the overall attractive\nnature of the gravitational field. These findings highlight the role of\nnon-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in constructing observationally\ndistinguishable wormhole configurations."}

Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine\nthe conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which\ncorrespond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of\nwhich can eliminate half degree of freedom.

The results confirm the dynamical\ncharacter of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and\nthe present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs\nto the quintessence regime.
