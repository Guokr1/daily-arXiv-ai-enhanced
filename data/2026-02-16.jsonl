The main challenge with using a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas target is the significantly lower gas gains to which they are typically limited. Recently, a MMThGEM device has been successfully demonstrated as an excellent gain stage device in the NID gas SF$_6$; capable of producing gas gains comparable with the electron drift gas CF$_4$. The next major challenge is to extend this high gain capability to multi-dimensional readout for the purpose of particle track reconstruction. The MMThGEM is therefore ideal for coupling to a strip readout detector like a Micromegas to achieve a high gain multi-dimensional Negative Ion (NI) readout plane, which is potentially suitable for the scale up required by future searches proposed by the CYGNUS consortium. In this paper, the first high gain demonstration of such a MMThGEM-Micromegas detector in low pressure SF$_6$ is described. This includes detector characterisation in a small test vessel resulting in the largest NI gas gain ever reported, 1.22 $\\pm$ 0.08 $\\times$ 10$^5$ , and directionality with alpha particles. Finally, this gain characterisation and tracking capability is leveraged to measure the energy and range of events, and identify those consistent with Nuclear Recoils (NRs), in a large cubic metre scale volume of SF$_6$ for the first time."}

The spectrometer has eight pixels and achieves an energy resolution between 15 and 30 eV across the entire energy range. It faces a cryogenic source sampler with four movable sources. Each source contains a mixture of radionuclides, including Yb-169 and Co-57 used to calibrate the spectrometer and correct its non-linearity. The gamma-ray energies, emitted through the decay of Co-57, Cd-109, Ba-133, Gd-153, Eu-154, Eu-155, Yb-169, Tm-170, Pb-210, Np-239, Am-241 and Am-243, have been reassessed. The lowest absolute uncertainty achieved is 0.13 eV at 105.3 keV, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 1.3 ppm. Of the 27 measured gamma rays, the uncertainties of 19 energies were improved with respect to the available literature: 10 by a factor of 5 and 4 by more than one order of magnitude. Good agreement is observed with energies obtained elsewhere by wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. This work significantly improves upon previously reported gamma energies obtained by energy-dispersive spectrometry using semiconductor detectors, thanks to the ultra-high energy resolution of magnetic microcalorimeters."}

Vanadium redox flow batteries offer a viable option among other technologies, due to their long lifetime and independently scalable output power and capacity. The electrolyte temperature should be maintained within the range of 5-40 Celsius for safe operation; therefore, a thermal management system is necessary, which affects battery efficiency. The study presents a detailed, containerized battery model with a hybrid thermal management system that considers thermal radiation and real ambient temperatures. A total of 180 configurations were investigated in 10 cases, ranging from 4 to 400 kW, with 18 different discharging current-cell number ratios in each case, including multistack arrangements. Current-dependent ohmic losses influence the electric efficiency, which increases from a minimum of 68% to 89% in low-current configurations. However, the net system efficiency ranges between 43% and 66% due to the self-consumption of pumps, the inverter, and the thermal management system. In addition to the detailed efficiency analysis, a comprehensive investigation of thermal processes is provided in terms of the current-cell number ratio and output power, which is crucial for designing thermal management systems and sizing batteries."}

The solver advances magnetic fields using constrained transport to preserve $\\nabla\\!\\cdot\\!\\mathbf{B}=0$ to machine precision and employs geometry-consistent high-order reconstruction with an enhanced Partial Donor Cell method (e-PDM) that accounts for geometry curvature. Flexible numerics include various numerical fluxes and time integrators. In axial symmetric coordinates, angular momentum are preserved to round-off, and a ring-averaging treatment near the axis relaxes CFL constraints while maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields. Optional capabilities include the semi-relativistic (Boris) correction, background-field splitting, and an anisotropic MHD formulation. Rewritten in C, the code adopts a modular design that simplifies case setup and facilitates the addition of physics modules and coupling to other first-principles codes. Standard benchmarks across multiple geometries verify the code's high accuracy, low numerical diffusion, and robust handling of coordinate singularities and rotating flows. GAMERA-OP provides a practical, high-order framework for space and astrophysical plasma applications where orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and exact angular-momentum conservation are advantageous."}

However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution."}

Emerging optoelectronic RC platforms,such as light-driven memristors, merge the benefits of electronic and photonic computation. However, conventional designs are often limited by the unipolar photoresponse of optoelectronic devices, which restricts reservoir state diversity and reduces computational accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an all-optically controlled RC system employing an oxide memristor array that demonstrates exceptional uniformity and stability. The memristive devices exhibit wavelength-dependent bipolar photoresponse, originating from light-induced dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies. Tuning the power density and irradiation mode of dual-wavelength light pulses enables dynamic control of photocurrent relaxation and nonlinearity. By leveraging these unique device properties, we develop bipolar and parallel coding strategies to significantly enrich reservoir dynamics and enhance nonlinear mapping capability. In word recognition and time-series prediction tasks, the bipolar coding demonstrates markedly improved accuracy compared to unipolar coding. The parallel coding supports multi-source signal fusion within a single reservoir, maintaining high computational accuracy while significantly reducing hardware consumption. This work provides a high-performance approach to physical RC, paving the way for intelligent edge computing."}

The theory accommodates up to six propagating degrees of freedom, comprising two tensor, two vector, and two scalar modes, in addition to matter perturbations. In certain regions of the parameter space, the number of scalar degrees of freedom is reduced to one or even zero. To investigate the stability, we systematically analyze ghost, Laplacian, and tachyonic instabilities at the linear perturbative level. The stability conditions are easily satisfied for tensor perturbations, but impose nontrivial constraints on the parameter space for vector perturbations. Furthermore, in the presence of a nonvanishing background vector field, the scalar sector becomes unstable at small wavenumbers $|\\vec{k}|$. In the small-scale limit ($|\\vec{k}|\\rightarrow\\infty$), we further investigate the GW properties of the general Einstein-vector theory within the stable parameter space, including the number of independent modes, their propagation speeds, and observational constraints from GW experiments. We find that there are at most two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode. Notably, vector GWs propagate superluminally, yet they are forbidden if tensor GWs travel exactly at light speed. This distinctive feature provides a key observational signature for testing the theory."}

Analytical stability conditions for these fixed points are derived, and numerical simulations reveal characteristic evolutionary patterns, such as spiral trajectories and damped oscillations in the additive mixed power-law model. Furthermore, statefinder diagnostics are applied to quantitatively distinguish these models from the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm and other dark energy scenarios. The results indicate that $f(T,B)$ gravity offers a theoretically consistent and observationally distinguishable geometric framework for explaining cosmic acceleration, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional dark energy models."}

We demonstrate this with measurements of sky calibrators and observations of 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) in the LMC and the nearby galaxy NGC 6744. Within 0.3 deg of the optical axis, the ratio of system temperature to dish aperture efficiency is 25 K and the ratio with beam efficiency is 21 K (at 1.4 GHz). For the previously measured $T_{sys} = 17$ K, respective efficiency values 0.7 and 0.8 are derived. Our HI observational results are in good agreement with previous results, although detailed comparison with multibeam observations of the LMC suggests that the earlier observations may have missed an extended component of low-column-density gas ($8\\times 10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$). We use the cryoPAF zoom-band and wideband data to make a preliminary investigation of whether the large number of simultaneous beams (72) permits the use of novel data reduction methods to reduce the effects of foreground/background continuum contamination and RFI. We also investigate if these methods can better protect against signal loss for the detection of faint, extended cosmological signals such as HI intensity maps. Using robust higher-order singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, we find encouraging results for the detection of both compact and extended sources, including challenging conditions with high RFI occupancy and significant sky continuum structure.

It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \\emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded."}

The prototype CHIME/Slow pipeline was tested on archival data obtained in December 2022, January 2023 and February 2023 with a total on-sky time of 17 days with an instantaneous Field of View (FoV) of $\\sim$13 deg$^2$ . In this pilot survey, we detected nine bursts, one from a new non-repeating source and eight from the known hyperactive repeating source FRB 20220912A. Out of these nine bursts, two bursts from the repeater were not detected by CHIME/FRB, while the non-repeater was detected in the side-lobe of a beam in the CHIME/FRB exhibiting shorter pulse width and narrower bandwidth compared to the CHIME/Slow detection. Here we report properties of the bursts, discuss the sensitivity and completeness of the current version of the CHIME/Slow pipeline, and outline future development to improve its performance. Finally, based on these results, we report the all-sky rate (95% credible region) of radio transients with pulse widths between 16 ms to 5 s, fluence above 5 Jy ms and observing frequency of 600 MHz to be between 184 and 4556 bursts sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$."}

Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $χ_{\\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $Δχ_{\\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $χ<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.\n  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $χ_{\\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a feasibility study exploring the implementation of optical interferometry and speckle techniques with the 1.3-m Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope (DFOT) at ARIES, which is currently dedicated to photometric observations. Using the sCMOS camera as the DFOT backend, we perform interferometric speckle observations of several binary stars. Standard Speckle Interferometry (SI) algorithms are applied to analyze the recorded data. While this study does not aim to achieve the diffraction limit of DFOT or address a full science-driven resolution case, it serves as a crucial testbed for instrumentation, data acquisition, and analysis of Speckles with DFOT. Notably, we successfully identify and correct tracking-related positional errors in the observed binary systems, demonstrating the viability of the approach. These results provide strong motivation for more systematic observations and future implementation of optical interferometry techniques at meter-class telescopes."}

We demonstrate that by introducing the boundary term C, a non-metricity scalar-tensor theory can recover Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) in the Einstein frame. Motivated by this, we propose a novel gravity model where a scalar field couples nonminimally to both the non-metricity scalar Q and the boundary term C. We focus in the cosmological scenario where we present the covariant formulation and a unified autonomous system framework that treats generic affine-connection choices, including coincident and non-coincident gauges, on an equal footing. Our dynamical analysis across three connection branches reveals standard thermal histories and stable de Sitter attractors. These results show that boundary-term couplings provide a well-posed, geometrically flexible route to addressing late-time cosmic acceleration."}

Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations. These simple, tractable formulas not only facilitate theoretical calculations but also yield testable predictions for future CMB observations."}

Photometric classification offers a scalable alternative, enabling the identification of larger, fainter, and higher-redshift supernova samples suitable for applications such as Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) cosmology. We present a feature-based photometric classifier for SNe detected by ZTF, with the primary goal of constructing a photometric SN Ia sample for cosmological analyses. Our approach utilises the autoencoder architecture of ParSNIP (Boone 2021) to capture the intrinsic diversity of SN light curves. We trained the model on a spectroscopically classified ZTF SN sample, incorporating a realistic noise augmentation procedure that simulates the flux uncertainties of fainter sources. Light curve features were used to train a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier, implemented in both binary (SN Ia vs. non-Ia) and multi-class configurations. We validated our classifier on independent, fainter ZTF data with and without noise augmentation. To evaluate real-time performance, we also applied our classifier to live ZTF alerts and conducted a spectroscopic classification survey within the ePESSTO+ collaboration. We found that noise augmentation significantly improves classification performance, particularly for fainter sources. Our binary classifier achieves an SN Ia recall of (98.1 $\\pm$ 0.4)%, averaged across five train-test splits. SN Ia recall exceeds 98% for events with a peak apparent magnitude up to 20 and more than 10 detections, and remains above 96% up to magnitude 20.5. Overall, 95% of sources were correctly classified in both binary and multi-class modes. Our classifier performs efficiently on real ZTF data and enables construction of a large photometric SN Ia sample for cosmology."}

We introduce an analytical tool based on Fisher information to quantify the error in parameter inference arising from ignoring these effects. Finally, we address the issue of locally stationary processes and optimal time chunking."}
