While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.", "AI": {"tldr": "BGO\u6750\u6599\u5728TOF-PET\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u6676\u4f53\u95f4\u6563\u5c04(InterCS)\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5149\u5b50\u4ea7\u989d\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u50cf\u7d20\u5316BGO\u9635\u5217\u4e2d\u6676\u4f53\u95f4\u6563\u5c04\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbTOF-PET\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9a\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u50cf\u7d20\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u914d\u5408\u5206\u6bb5SiPM\u8bfb\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408GATE\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "InterCS\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e3a221 ps FWHM\uff0c\u6bd4FED\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684184 ps\u5dee\uff1bInterCS\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5728\u99961 ns\u5185\u5e73\u5747\u68c0\u6d4b\u52304.73\u4e2a\u5149\u5b50\uff0c\u5c11\u4e8eFED\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76845.76\u4e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u5316BGO TOF-PET\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u6700\u4f73\u5b9a\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions.

Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms.

We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\\mathrm{\u03bcm}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $\u03bc(t) = \u03bc_0 \\left[ 1 - \\exp\\big( - (t/\u03c4)^\u03b2 \\big) \\right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $\u03c4= 6$--$50~\\mathrm{\u03bcm}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $\u03bb_D < \u03c4\\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \\gtrsim 3\u03c4$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7eaf\u9517\u4ece\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u5230\u5fae\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u539a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u9075\u5faa\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9759\u7535\u8017\u5c3d\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u6563\u5c04\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7eaf\u9517\u5728\u4ece\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u51cf\u8584\u5230\u5fae\u7c73\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u3001\u8584\u4f53\u9517\u7535\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4ece2.7mm\u51cf\u8584\u52307\u03bcm\u7684n\u578b\u548cp\u578b\u9ad8\u7eaf\u9517\u6837\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u970d\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u7684\u539a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u9075\u5faa\u6269\u5c55\u6307\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u03bc(t)=\u03bc\u2080[1-exp(-(t/\u03c4)\u1d5d)]\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u9759\u7535\u957f\u5ea6\u03c4=6-50\u03bcm\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u9759\u7535\u8017\u5c3d\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u6563\u5c04\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u5219\uff1a\u4fdd\u6301\u539a\u5ea6t\u22733\u03c4\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4f53\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\uff0c\u66f4\u8584\u7684\u5668\u4ef6\u8fdb\u5165\u8017\u5c3d\u63a7\u5236\u533a\u57df\u3002\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a\u8d85\u8584\u9ad8\u7eaf\u9517\u8fc1\u79fb\u7387\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments.

Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry.

However, the practical applications of TFCs have been hindered thus far by the need for cryogenic cooling, limited bandwidth, and bulky configuration, largely due to the lack of advanced THz sources. Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u632f\u96a7\u7a7f\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u7684\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u7387\u68b3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ba4\u6e29\u5de5\u4f5c\u3001\u5bbd\u5e26\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230120 Gbps\u7684\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u3001\u8ba1\u91cf\u5b66\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6e29\u51b7\u5374\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u9501\u6a21\u5171\u632f\u96a7\u7a7f\u4e8c\u6781\u7ba1\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u91d1\u5c5e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u76f4\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RTD\u632f\u8361\u5668\u6ce8\u5165\u5f3a\u8fde\u7eed\u6ce2\u5c04\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bbd\u5e26\u3001\u65e0\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u68b3\u72b6\u9891\u8c31\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u6e29\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.14\u81f30.325 THz\u7684\u5bbd\u5e26\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u9891\u7387\u53ef\u57280.9\u81f350 GHz\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8c03\u8c10\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u901a\u9053\u548c\u591a\u901a\u9053\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523016 Gbps\u548c120 Gbps\u7684\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5ba4\u6e29\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u9891\u7387\u68b3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage.

Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u9053\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7834\u7f3a\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5355\u5757BIC\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u8d85\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u62d3\u6251\u8bf1\u5bfc\u81ea\u65cb\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u4ea7\u751f\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u6da1\u65cb\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u6da1\u65cb\u95f4\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c0f\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u7eb5\u62d3\u6251\u6fc0\u53d1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5149\u8c03\u5236\u6216\u5fae\u8154TE-TM\u504f\u632f\u5206\u88c2\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u53ea\u80fd\u95f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u8d5d\u81ea\u65cb\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u7834\u7f3a\u53cd\u6f14\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5355\u5757BIC\u9499\u949b\u77ff\u8d85\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u91cf\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u51dd\u805a\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u534a\u6da1\u65cb\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u6da1\u65cb\u95f4\u8ddd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u51dd\u805a\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u7531\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u53cd\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u504f\u632f\u5f26\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u534a\u6da1\u65cb\u5bf9\uff0c\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u84dd\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4f7f\u6da1\u65cb\u95f4\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u8154\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u5de5\u7a0b\u5316\u6781\u5316\u6fc0\u5b50\u6d41\u4f53\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8d5d\u81ea\u65cb\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u64cd\u7eb5\u6da1\u65cb\u6210\u6838\u3001\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u6e6e\u706d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u573a\u3002"}}

Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.\n  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5fae\u578b\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u2014\u2014\u98de\u8d8a\u5f0f\u516c\u4ea4\uff08FBT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62d6\u8f66\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f66\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u95e8\u5230\u95e8\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u67a2\u7ebd\u7ad9\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u8026\u5408\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u901f\u8f66\u961f\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u62d6\u8f66\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u505c\u8f66\u8fd0\u8425\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u516c\u4ea4\u8f66\u6982\u5ff5\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u6001\u8026\u5408\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u6362\u4e58\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u719f\u3002FBT\u65e8\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u51fa\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u5fae\u578b\u7535\u52a8\u8f66\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u62d6\u8f66\u63d0\u4f9b\u6309\u9700\u63a5\u9a73\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f66\u5728\u4e3b\u5e72\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5f15\u5bfc\u8026\u5408\u62d6\u8f66\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u901f\u8f66\u961f\u3002\u62d6\u8f66\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u8425\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u7ed5\u884c\u63a5\u9a73\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u6307\u5b9a\u67a2\u7ebd\u8fdb\u884c\u9759\u6001\u8026\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u62d6\u8f66\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u505c\u8f66\u8fd0\u8425\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8d70\u5eca\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cFBT\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u516c\u4ea4\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u51fa\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7f51\u7ea6\u8f66\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eFBT\u6bd4\u516c\u4ea4\u548c\u51fa\u79df\u8f66\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u8282\u7701\u8d85\u8fc713%\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "FBT\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u4ea4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u57ce\u5e02\u51fa\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86WEAVE\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53e0\u52a0\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\u89c6\u573a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c2\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4eae\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eWEAVE-TwiLight-Survey\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5149\u8c31\u5de1\u5929\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u4eae\u661f\u65f6\u56e0\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u52a0\u548c\u6548\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bfc\u661f\u7684\u89c6\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53e0\u52a0\u591a\u4e2a\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u5bc6\u5ea6\u89c6\u573a\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u5149\u7ea4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u7684\u5bfc\u661f\u5149\u7ea4\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6821\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u5f00\u653e\u9ec4\u660f\u65f6\u6bb5\u7ed9WEAVE\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6269\u5c55\u4e86WEAVE\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f4e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u89c6\u573a\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5316\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach.

The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments.

This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe.

Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld\u5f15\u529b\u4e0e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6d41\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u7684\u975e\u5947\u70b9\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b64\u7c7b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u73af\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5947\u70b9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b50\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u8584\u4e14\u5149\u5b66\u8584\u7684\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u65e0\u675f\u7f1a\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u5355\u8272\u53d1\u5c04\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5149\u5b50\u73af\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8fd1\u675f\u7f1a\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7684\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u7c7b\u975e\u5947\u70b9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u5149\u5b50\u73af\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u6570\u503c\u3001\u76d8\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6e05\u6670\u533a\u5206\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u6307\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b50\u73af\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u7c7b\u975e\u5947\u70b9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5982\u70ed\u70b9\u6216\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u96be\u3002"}}

Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4fee\u6b63Chaplygin\u7c7b\u6697\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u5f26\u4e91\u590d\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5149\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5728\u590d\u5408\u73af\u5883\uff08\u4fee\u6b63Chaplygin\u7c7b\u6697\u6d41\u4f53\u548c\u5f26\u4e91\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5947\u5f02\u9ed1\u6d1e\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528WKB\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7070\u4f53\u8c31\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u5438\u79ef\u4e0b\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5b83\u4eec\u5728eikonal\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5f26\u4e91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9634\u5f71\u3001\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7070\u4f53\u56e0\u5b50\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800cMCDF\u53c2\u6570\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u53ef\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u73af\u5883\u7ec4\u5206\u5728\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u7559\u4e0b\u72ec\u7279\u4f46\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u5408\u73af\u5883\u7ec4\u5206\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7559\u4e0b\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5370\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5947\u5f02\u9ed1\u6d1e\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\\sim 135^{\\circ} < \u03c6< 270^{\\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u6ce2\u5728\u514b\u5c14-\u7ebd\u66fc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6563\u5c04\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7535\u8377\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e26\u7535\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u4e0a\u6807\u91cf\u6ce2\u6563\u5c04\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u6563\u5c04\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7535\u8377\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u6563\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u6ce2\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5fae\u5206\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u6570\u7ea6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u524d\u5411\u53d1\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7535\u8377\u3001\u7535\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u5bf9\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7535\u78c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u62d6\u66f3\u6548\u5e94\u90fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u8363\u8000\u6563\u5c04\u504f\u79bb\u7cbe\u786e\u540e\u5411\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u6216\u573a\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u6563\u5c04\u901a\u91cf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b\u8d85\u8f90\u5c04\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\uff0c\u987a\u884c\u6563\u5c04\u89d2\u622a\u9762\u968f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e26\u7535\u65cb\u8f6c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5728\u8d64\u9053\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6563\u5c04\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u5206\u6790\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u5e26\u7535\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes.

Comments welcome. Resubmitted after review to PRD", "summary": "The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u610f\u7a33\u6001\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u6240\u53d7\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u866b\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f20\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u4e2a\u6848\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u5929\u6587\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u5305\u542b\u6709\u5173\u5f3a\u573a\u5f15\u529b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u96f6\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Schwarzschild\u3001Reissner-Nordstrom\u3001Kerr\u3001Kerr-Newman\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5ea6\u89c4\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u866b\u6d1e\u5ea6\u89c4\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u6f6e\u6c50\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Hills\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u9ed1\u6d1e\u80fd\u591f\u6495\u88c2\u6052\u661f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u88f8\u5947\u70b9\u5ea6\u89c4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f20\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u573a\u5f15\u529b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution.

While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Pleba\u0144ski--Demia\u0144ski class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full \"tower of symmetries\". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics.

Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u9891\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u6d4b\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80fd\u4e3a\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u5728\u574d\u7f29\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u524d\u7ecf\u5386\u8d85\u91cd\u6216\u6781\u91cd\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08ET\u3001CE\u3001NEMO\uff09\u89c2\u6d4b\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u81ea\u65cb\u4e2d\u6027\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\uff08MTOV\uff09\u3002", "result": "CE\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5408\u5e76\u7387\uff08250 Gpc-3yr-1\uff09\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u8d28\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7ea6\u4e3a8%\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u5730\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u9891\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684MTOV\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u5e76\u662f\u5426\u5f62\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \\to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7531\u5f26\u4e91\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49Letelier-Alencar\u89e3\u4e0b\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f26\u4e91\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49Letelier\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97Kretschmann\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u66f2\u7387\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5706\u5f62\u5149\u5b50\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u7c92\u5b50\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u4e0b\u843d\u4e0e\u5706\u5468\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5149\u5b50\u7403\u548c\u6700\u5185\u7a33\u5b9a\u5706\u8f68\u9053\u534a\u5f84\u968f\u5f26\u4e91\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c0f\uff1b\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u62c9\u4f38\u538b\u7f29\u53cd\u8f6c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5706\u5468\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f26\u4e91\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5f00\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u7387\u548c\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u5256\u9762\u3002"}}
