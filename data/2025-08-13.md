### [1] [Fluorescence time profile measurement of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to medium relativistic ion particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08546)

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 本文首次测量了LAB基液体闪烁体对高能离子的荧光时间特性，并与放射性源结果对比，发现明显的$dE/dX$依赖性，这对大型探测器如JUNO的物理研究至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究液体闪烁体在高能离子激发下的荧光时间特性，填补现有数据空白，为大型探测器（如JUNO）的物理研究提供支持。

Method: 测量LAB基液体闪烁体对氢、氦和氪高能离子（200-300 MeV/u）的荧光时间特性，并与放射性源结果对比。

Result: 观察到明显的$dE/dX$依赖性，与粒子类型无关。

Conclusion: 这些发现对理解闪烁机制和大型探测器（如JUNO）的物理研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its
high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain
liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of
difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles.
Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive
decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence
time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy
ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u
for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources
and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type.
These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova
neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are
also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing
mechanism.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于X射线探测器的数据压缩ASIC，采用流式固定长度有损压缩方案，支持MHz级帧率传输大数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代X射线探测器系统需要紧凑、高效且快速的数据压缩方案，以处理像素阵列的大数据传输，实现MHz级帧率。

Method: 采用向量矩阵乘积逻辑，执行浮点乘法、加法和累加操作，验证并合成了该逻辑，确保其适应探测器面积限制。

Result: 压缩方案在192x168像素、12位宽度的探测器上可行，压缩比范围为100至250。

Conclusion: 该研究为X射线和电子探测器的片上固定长度压缩（如PCA、SVD）和数据缩减（如方位角积分）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Modern X-ray detector systems urgently require compact, efficient, and fast
data compression schemes to handle the transmission of big data from pixel
arrays, enabling frame rates in the MHz regime. In this work, a data
compression ASIC that implements a streaming fixed-length lossy compression
scheme is introduced and analyzed, proving the feasibility and benefits of
on-chip compression. The compression scheme utilizes a vector matrix product
logic, which performs a number of floating-point multiplications, additions,
and accumulations. The logic is verified, synthesized, and shown to fit in the
area resource available for the X-ray detector under study, which comprises 192
x 168 pixels each of 12-bit width, and having a total area of 20 mm x 20 mm,
about 2 mm x 20 mm of which are available for the digital logic. Several system
architectures, precisions, and compression ratios ranging from 100 to 250 were
analyzed to pave the way for on-chip fixed-length compression (e.g., principal
component analysis, singular value decomposition) and data reduction (e.g.,
azimuthal integration) for X-ray and electron detectors.

### [3] [Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08365)
*Mikel Falxa,Alberto Sesana*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，用于检测脉冲星计时阵列（PTA）数据中的非高斯特征，通过高斯混合模型（GMM）扩展了传统的高斯假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PTA数据分析假设噪声为高斯分布，但对于某些天体物理信号（如超大质量黑洞双星产生的引力波背景），这一假设可能不成立。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型（GMM）建模噪声或信号统计特性，保持似然函数的解析形式，并扩展了自由谱分析。

Result: 通过模拟验证了方法的有效性，并展示了PTA对非高斯性的敏感性。在单个超大质量黑洞双星叠加高斯引力波背景的场景中，发现了显著的非高斯特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为PTA数据分析提供了更灵活的工具，能够检测和量化非高斯性，适用于更广泛的信号类型。

Abstract: In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be
Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical
form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this
Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and
cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB)
generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this
work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features
in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or
signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this
approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully
analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This
makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis
tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by
producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred
from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We
validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to
non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function
of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically
motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB
and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual
source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a
simulated population of SMBHBs.

### [4] [Optimized smoothing kernels for SPH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08471)
*Robert Wissing,Thomas R. Quinn,Ben Keller,James Wadsley,Sijing Shen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出一组新的SPH平滑核函数，通过线性组合和优化策略改进收敛性，适用于GDSPH和ISPH，并在多种测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进SPH方法的收敛性，同时不增加计算成本。

Method: 通过线性组合其他SPH核函数，结合优化策略（以Gresho-Chan涡旋测试为例），并探索多种正定核函数。

Result: 在低邻居数（<128）下显著改进，GDSPH效果最佳。

Conclusion: 新核函数在多种测试中表现优异，同时提出了一种生成非偏初始条件的方法。

Abstract: We present a set of new smoothing kernels for smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) that improve the convergence of the method without any additional
computational cost. These kernels are generated through a linear combination of
other SPH kernels, combined with an optimization strategy to minimize the error
in the Gresho-Chan vortex test case. To facilitate the different choices in
gradient operators for SPH in the literature, we perform this optimization for
both geometric density average force SPH (GDSPH) and linear-corrected gradient
SPH (ISPH). In addition to the Gresho-Chan vortex, we also perform simulations
of the hydrostatic glass, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the Sod shocktube
case. At low neighbour numbers (< 128), there is a significant improvement
across the different tests, with the greatest impact shown for GDSPH. Apart
from the popular Wendland kernels, we also explore other positive-definite
kernels in this paper, which include the "missing" Wendland kernels, Wu
kernels, and Buhmann kernels. In addition, we also present a method for
producing arbitrary non-biased initial conditions in SPH. This method uses the
SPH momentum equation together with an artificial pressure, combined with a
global and local relaxation stage to minimize local and global errors.

### [5] [SKYSURF VIII -- Modeling SKYSURF Completeness Data for Comparison to the Hubble Space Telescope Exposure Time Calculator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08484)
*Zachary Goisman,Timothy Carleton,Seth H. Cohen,Delondrae Carter,Rogier A. Windhorst,Rosalia O'Brien,Eyan Weissbluth*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文通过模拟不同参数的天体检测率，比较了HST数据的实际完整性与ETC预测的差异，发现ETC对扩展星系的预测比实际数据更乐观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估图像源的完整性对望远镜数据测量至关重要，尤其是比较STSCI ETC预测与实际数据的差异。

Method: 在HST的SKYSURF项目数据中，通过添加模拟天体并检测其发现率，建模图像完整性与曝光时间和背景的关系。

Result: ETC对扩展星系的预测比实际数据低估了1-2星等的完整性限制。

Conclusion: ETC的平坦表面亮度轮廓对扩展源的预测不如论文中更真实的轮廓准确。

Abstract: Accurately assessing image source completeness is critical for interpreting
measurements on telescope data. Using the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and
Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data from the Hubble Space Telescope ($HST$)
archival project "SKYSURF", we model galaxy completeness as a function of the
exposure time and background of an image. This is accomplished by adding
simulated objects with varying magnitudes and sizes into these images, and
determining the detection rate for each set of parameters. The fifty percent
completeness results are then compared to the Exposure Time Calculator (ETC),
in order to assess the differences between the STSCI ETC and our analysis of
the archival data. Ultimately, we find that, for extended galaxies, the ETC
predicts a 1-2 magnitudes fainter completeness limit than our data. We believe
the difference is due to the ETC's flat surface brightness profiles being less
accurate at predicting for extended sources compared to our more realistic
profiles.

### [6] [A 2821 Star Optical SETI Survey using ESO HARPS archival data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08628)
*Benjamin Fields,Jason C. Goodman*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 研究人员分析了2,821颗恒星的HARPS光谱数据，寻找外星激光信号，最终筛选出3个无法解释的候选信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索外星文明存在的可能性，通过高分辨率光谱技术检测潜在的窄带激光信号。

Method: 使用HARPS光谱仪数据，通过算法筛选窄带激光信号，排除已知干扰源（如宇宙射线、仪器伪影等）。

Result: 从2,821颗恒星中筛选出8个候选信号，进一步分析后剩下3个无法解释的信号，可能来自M型恒星和红巨星。

Conclusion: 3个候选信号值得进一步研究，需区分自然天体过程与潜在的外星信号。

Abstract: We examined archived observations of 2,821 stars taken by the high-resolution
ESO HARPS spectrograph to search for potential narrow-band laser emissions from
extraterrestrial sources. From one observation of each star, our search
algorithm identified a total of 285 spectral peaks with line widths slightly
larger than the instrument's point-spread function. After eliminating false
positives (including cosmic rays, instrumental artifacts, and terrestrial
airglow lines, we identified 8 sources worthy of follow-up observations. We
then analyzed all 1,835 additional observations of these follow-up targets,
looking for recurring signals. We found 1 additional unexplained candidate in
this followup search, but no candidate spikes which repeated at the same
wavelength as one of the initial candidates at a later time. Further analysis
identified one candidate as a likely faint airglow line. The remaining seven
candidates continued to defy all false positive categories, including
interference by LiDAR satellites and adaptive optics lasers from neighboring
observatories. However, observations of other stars on the same night showed
identical spectral spikes (in the telescope's reference frame) for four of
these seven candidates -- indicating an as-yet unknown terrestrial source. This
leaves 3 final candidates which currently defy the prosaic explanations
examined thus far, show no indication of a terrestrial origin and therefore
warrant further investigation. Two of these three candidates originate from
M-Type stars and one of them originates from an oscillating red giant, so
follow-up work will need to disentangle natural astrophysical stellar processes
from potential SETI sources.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文探讨了增材制造（3D打印）在轻量化镜面制造中的潜力，通过优化设计和后处理技术（如热等静压）实现60%的质量减轻，但发现热等静压虽减少孔隙率却增加了表面粗糙度和光学散射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统镜面制造技术（如铣削、铸造、粘接）难以实现复杂晶格结构，而增材制造能显著减轻质量并保持机械性能，但需进一步研究光学表面质量以验证其实际应用价值。

Method: 设计并制造了一款用于CubeSat平台的增材制造镜面，采用AlSi10Mg铝合金打印，后经机械加工和单点金刚石车削，并通过热等静压处理评估其对光学表面质量的影响。

Result: 热等静压减少了表面孔隙率，但增加了表面粗糙度和光学散射，表明需权衡后处理技术的利弊。

Conclusion: 增材制造在轻量化镜面制造中具有潜力，但需进一步优化后处理技术以平衡孔隙率和表面粗糙度，确保光学性能。

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D Printing), a process which creates a part
layer-by-layer, has the potential to improve upon conventional lightweight
mirror manufacturing techniques, including subtractive (milling), formative
(casting) and fabricative (bonding) manufacturing. Increased mass reduction
whilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation
of intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture
conventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the
number of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation
using computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature.
However, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface,
is required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised.
This paper outlines the development & metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat
platform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid
body. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design,
with a focus on manufacture, testing & evaluation. This is achieved through a
simplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted
within a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external
diameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription
is flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a
low-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They
were then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective
surface. Both quantitative & qualitative evaluations of the optical surface
were conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the
optical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface
porosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently,
optical scatter.

Conclusion: SST-1M的设计和性能验证为甚高能伽马射线天文观测提供了高效工具，特别是在恶劣观测条件下。

Abstract: SST-1M is a prototype single mirror Small Sized Cherenkov Telescope designed
for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. With a 4 meter primary mirror
and a 5.6 meter focal length, it provides a wide 9 degree optical field of
view, optimized for detecting VHE gamma-rays from 1 TeV to several hundred TeV.
Its focal plane is equipped with DigiCam, a fully digital trigger and readout
camera made of 1296 silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) pixels. The use of SiPM
sensors enables observation under high night sky background (NSB) conditions,
significantly enhancing the instrument's duty cycle and allowing observations
under moonlight.
  Currently, two SST-1M telescopes are deployed at the Ond\v rejov Observatory
in the Czech Republic, operating in stereo, at 510 m altitude, to observe
astrophysical sources. This contribution presents the SiPM calibration
procedure and performance validation of the instrument, based on updated
results from Crab Nebula observations.

Abstract: Modern radio interferometers are designed with increasingly sprawling
geographical footprints, offering enhanced sensitivity and resolution. However,
managing such extensive facilities presents operational challenges that can
potentially impede or delay scientific progress. One solution to such obstacles
is the `swarm telescope' concept which enables collaborative use of individual
telescope systems, overseen by separate institutions, to create a more powerful
and manageable facility. We present the design, construction, and commissioning
of the Long Wavelength Array -- North Arm (LWA-NA) station, a prototype
64-element LWA Swarm telescope. LWA-NA is a cost-efficient, rapidly deployable
platform for radio astronomy, and serves as a pathfinder for the larger LWA
Swarm project.

Motivation: 扩展液滴蚀刻外延技术的应用范围，以覆盖更广的发射波长，同时保持其低密度、小FSS值和快速辐射衰减等优势。

Method: 采用液滴蚀刻外延技术生长In(Ga)As量子点于AlGaAs中。

Conclusion: 这些量子点特别适合集成量子光子学应用。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have
demonstrated very promising properties as sources of single photons and
entangled photons on-demand. Among different growth methods, droplet etching
epitaxy has allowed the growth of almost strain-free QDs, with low and
controllable surface densities, small excitonic fine structure splitting (FSS),
and fast radiative decays. Here, we extend the local droplet etching technique
to In(Ga)As QDs in AlGaAs, thereby increasing the achievable emission
wavelength range beyond that accessible to GaAs/AlGaAs QDs, while benefiting
from the aforementioned advantages of this growth method. We observe QD
densities of $\sim 0.2\ \mu\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, FSS values as small as $3\
\mu\mathrm{eV}$, and short radiative lifetimes of $\sim 300\ \mathrm{ps}$,
while extending the achievable emission range to $\sim 920\ \mathrm{nm}$ at
cryogenic temperatures. We envision these QDs to be particularly suitable for
integrated quantum photonics applications.

Motivation: 研究Ga2O3光导半导体开关在不同几何结构和光激发方式下的性能差异，以优化其在高功率高速脉冲应用中的表现。

Method: 通过实验比较横向和纵向β-Ga2O3光导半导体开关在内激发（245 nm）和外激发（280 nm、300 nm、445 nm）下的性能。

Result: 内激发下横向结构光电流表现更优，外激发下纵向结构因电场分布更均匀而性能更佳。

Conclusion: 几何结构和载流子生成机制对Ga2O3光导半导体开关性能至关重要，为高效低成本高压开关的开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with its ultra-wide bandgap (approximately 4.8 eV) and
high breakdown field (approximately 8 MV per cm), is a leading candidate for
photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSSs) in high-power and high-speed
pulsed applications. This work, for the first time, presents a systematic
experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both
intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical
excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined
near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1
and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance
compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation,
which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited
enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field
distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical
role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3
PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and
cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.

Abstract: In a radiation emergency, every second counts, yet the public rarely has
immediate access to dedicated monitoring devices when they are needed most.
Here, the first practical mobile phone-based emergency ionizing radiation
detection method is presented that operates entirely without requiring camera
coverage or additional hardware modifications. Utilizing a multimodal deep
learning approach that integrates sparse radiation-induced signal distributions
with the brightness patterns, the proposed framework effectively isolates
subtle radiation signals from overwhelming visual interference. A hybrid 3D-2D
convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies radiation-induced spots from raw
mobile phone video, while a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) fuses the radiation
signal and brightness maps for the dose rate estimation. The method detects
hazardous dose rates (25-280 mRem/h) rapidly within six seconds (accuracy
86-96%), and low-level radiation (-0.6 mRem/h) with extended measurement
durations achieves 87% accuracy. The developed method greatly enhances mobile
phone radiation detection practicality and shows substantial potential as an
accessible radiation emergency detection tool.

Abstract: Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter
propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom
inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss
potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled
particle states, specifically an induced modification of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in
meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent
work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds
surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to
superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like
entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left,
right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr
geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type
anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions.
Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous
terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS
terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled
squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.

Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance
instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole,
introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When
the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions
among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact
on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted
gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were
proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate
the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on
the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to
a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles
and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of
hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine
transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant
transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings,
especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory,
the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and
equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the
mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through
gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: In the field of gravitational wave science, next-generation detectors will be
substantially more accurate than the current suite of detectors. Numerical
relativity simulations of binary black hole (BBH) gravitational waveforms must
become faster, more efficient, and more accurate to be used in analyses of
these next-generation detections. One approach, which the \texttt{SpECTRE} code
employs, is using spectral methods for accuracy along with synchronous
task-based parallelism to avoid idle time in simulations and make the most
efficient use of computational resources. When writing an asynchronous
application, algorithms must be redesigned compared to their synchronous
counterparts. To illustrate this process, we present novel methods for
dynamically tracking the apparent horizons in evolutions of BBH mergers using a
feedback control system, all in the context of asynchronous parallelism. We
also briefly detail how these methods can be applied to binary neutron star
simulations performed with asynchronous parallelism.

Result: 发现瞬子是奇异的，无法描述从‘无’量子创生；忽略量子修正时，时空退化为德西特空间，但仍是测地不完备的。

Conclusion: 半经典量子引力框架下无法描述环面宇宙的量子创生，其可能性取决于普朗克尺度物理，无法与球面宇宙创生概率比较。

Abstract: We consider the quantum creation of a universe with flat spatial sections and
the topology of a 3-torus, taking into account the effect of Casimir energy. We
show that the corresponding instantons are singular. Since these instantons
describe universes originating in a state of infinite energy, we argue that
they cannot be interpreted as quantum creation from `nothing'. If quantum
corrections to the energy-momentum tensor are neglected, the spacetime of the
toroidal universe reduces to de Sitter space with appropriate periodic
identifications. Contrary to previous claims in the literature, this spacetime
is geodesically incomplete. We argue that this spacetime describes a classical
universe originating at a singularity, and not a quantum origin. We conclude
that the quantum creation of a toroidal universe from nothing cannot be
described in the context of semiclassical quantum gravity -- it is either
impossible, or it depends essentially on Planck-scale physics. We therefore see
no reasonable way to compare the probability of creation of a toroidal
universe, if it is possible at all, with that of a spherical universe.

Motivation: 研究GW230529_181500事件的性质，区分其是否为中子星-黑洞合并或双中子星合并，并评估电磁对应体的可探测性。

Method: 通过数值相对论波形模拟中子星-黑洞和双中子星合并事件，进行参数估计，并与实际事件数据对比。

Result: GW230529_181500更可能是中子星-黑洞合并，但双中子星合并的可能性无法排除。电磁对应体信号较暗，但Rubin天文台可能在两天内探测到。

Conclusion: GW230529_181500更可能为中子星-黑洞合并，但双中子星合并仍有可能。电磁对应体探测需考虑盘风抛射物。

Abstract: GW230529_181500 represented the first gravitational-wave detection with one
of the component objects' mass inferred to lie in the previously hypothesized
mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest observed black
holes. Given the expected maximum mass values for neutron stars, this object
was identified as a black hole, and, with the secondary component being a
neutron star, the detection was classified as a neutron star-black hole merger.
However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the known waveform degeneracy
between the spin and mass ratio in the employed gravitational-wave models,
GW230529_181500 could also be interpreted as a merger of two heavy ($\gtrsim 2
\mathrm{M}_\odot$) neutron stars with high spins. We investigate the
distinguishability of these scenarios by performing parameter estimation on
simulated signals obtained from numerical-relativity waveforms for both neutron
star-black hole and binary neutron star systems, with parameters consistent
with GW230529_181500, and comparing them to the analysis of the real event
data. We find that GW230529_181500 is more likely to have originated from a
neutron star-black hole merger, though the possibility of a binary neutron star
origin can not be ruled out. Moreover, we use the simulation data to estimate
the signatures of potential electromagnetic counterparts emitted by the
systems. We find them to be too dim to be located by current wide-field surveys
if only the dynamical ejecta is considered, and detectable by the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory during the first two days after merger if one accounts for
additional disk wind ejecta.

Result: 混合方法在仅使用两个谐波的情况下，恢复了第六阶导数，分数残差约为10^-6。

Conclusion: 混合方法提供了一种准确计算Kerr测地线高导数的通用框架，适用于引力波建模等应用。

Abstract: Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many
calculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave
generation to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these
functions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental
frequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the
coupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two
strategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate
high-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first
method maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second
method fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated
coordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to
overfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the
mapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital
functional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,
we propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate
with respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass
quadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth
derivative with a fractional residual $\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.
For orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed
in Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for
computing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These
results offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time
derivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to
applications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling,
where such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave
predictions.

Abstract: This work investigates additional gravitational features of a newly proposed
black hole spacetime within Kalb-Ramond gravity, incorporating non-commutative
corrections arising from a gauge-theoretic approach recently introduced in the
literature [arXiv:2507.17390]. Accordingly, null geodesics are solved
numerically to trace photon paths; the photon sphere and shadow are determined.
From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements of $Sgr A^{*}$, constraints on
the parameters $\Theta$ (which encapsulates the non-commutativity) and $\ell$
(the Lorentz-violating parameter) are established. To examine the stability of
critical orbits and the deflection angle (gravitational lensing) in the weak
field scenario, we compute the Gaussian curvature in order to use the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Moreover, the deflection angle has been calculated as
well in the strong deflection limit. Furthermore, Lensing observables are
estimated using EHT data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87$. Topological features such
as the topological photon sphere are also explored.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent
observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology
Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution
equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll
approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It
is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by
demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of
scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It
is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by
modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a
positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed
slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of
the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which
satisfies all ACT constraints.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了加速等离子体中电热效应的独立性，为相关物理现象提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Stewart-Tolman effect posits that accelerating conductors exhibit both
charge separation and rest-frame electric fields (``inertia of charge''), while
the Ehrenfest-Tolman effect states that acceleration induces temperature
gradients (``inertia of heat''). We study the interplay of these effects in
thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, we derive from first principles a
partial differential equation governing the electrothermal stratification of a
fully ionized plasma in equilibrium under irrotational relativistic
accelerations in curved spacetime. We then solve it in two settings: a plasma
enclosed in a uniformly accelerated box, and a plasma shell suspended above a
black hole horizon. The resulting electric fields are found not to depend on
the electric conductivity of the medium.

Abstract: In this brief note, we demonstrate that the hyperboloidal foliation
technique, applied to the study of black hole quasinormal modes, where the
spatial boundary is shifted from spacelike infinity to the future event horizon
and null infinity, is effectively equivalent to the conventional approach, in
which the asymptotic wave function typically diverges at both ends of spatial
infinity. Specifically, although perhaps counterintuitive, a given
hyperboloidal slicing, corresponding to a particular choice of coordinates,
always uniquely determines a scheme for extracting the wave function, dictated
by the asymptotic behavior of the master equation at the spatial boundary. It
follows that the efficiency and precision observed in evaluating the
quasinormal modes should be attributed primarily to other factors, such as the
use of Chebyshev grids.

Conclusion: 带电Proca星的稳定性与电荷参数密切相关，超临界解可能不稳定。

Abstract: We consider self-gravitating stationary configurations of a charged massive
complex Proca field, also known as charged Proca stars, in the particular case
of spherical symmetry. We first present a general 3+1 decomposition of the
Einstein--Maxwell--Proca system, starting from the action and field equations.
We then restrict our system to the case of spherical symmetry and, after
imposing a harmonic time dependence ansatz for the Proca field, we construct
families of charged Proca stars for different values of the charge parameter
$q$, and different values of the central Proca scalar potential $\varphi$. In a
similar way to the case of scalar boson stars, one can define a critical charge
$q=q_c$ that corresponds to the value for which the Coulomb repulsion of the
charged Proca field exactly cancels their newtonian gravitational attraction.
We find that supercritical solutions can exist for a limited range of charges
above the critical value $q>q_c$. We also consider the binding energy $E_B$ for
the different families of solutions, and find that gravitationally bound
solutions such that $E_B<0$ can only exist for subcritical charges such that
$q<q_c$, indicating that our supercritical solutions are probably dynamically
unstable against perturbations.
