In this work, we report the results of a calibration campaign performed with the collider operating, aimed at assessing the detector performance. A dedicated setup, including an array of quasi-hemispherical CZT sensors and a $^{152}$Eu source, was used to characterize the spectral response. The reconstructed emission lines were fitted with a model accounting for Gaussian response and incomplete charge recollection tails, and the detector linearity was evaluated by comparing the measured peak positions with their nominal energies.

In preparation for the EXKALIBUR phase, which targets heavier kaonic atoms, new 1 mm-thick SDDs have been developed with Politecnico di Milano and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. Their increased thickness enhances the quantum efficiency by a factor of about two at 30 keV while preserving excellent energy resolution. These detectors are also intended for VIP-3, the next-generation test of the Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP). Building on VIP-2, which set the most stringent limits on PEP-violating $K_α$ transitions in copper, VIP-3 will extend the search to heavier elements such as Ag, Sn, and Zr. Preliminary measurements demonstrate efficient detection up to 30 keV, supporting future high-precision studies of the kaon-nucleon interaction and PEP in heavier systems."}

Our approach significantly enhances both the resolution and linearity of position detection compared to the nominal reconstruction formula based on the device architecture.

We examine a case study at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), UK, involving the calibration of DC standard resistors of value 100 MOhm and 1 GOhm. Results from the period 2001 to 2015 were in error by approximately 0.7 parts per million (ppm), with quoted uncertainties (k=2) of 0.4 ppm and 1.6 ppm respectively. Inter-comparisons did not detect the error, mainly because the uncertainty due to the transportation drift of the comparison standards was too large to resolve it. Likewise, research into single-electron current standards did not detect the error because at this resistance value it was on the borderline of statistical significance. The key event was a comparison between PTB (Germany) and NPL (UK) of a new small-current measuring instrument, the ultrastable low-noise current amplifier (ULCA). At that time, the transport stability of the ULCA was not well established. Nevertheless, calibrations of the ULCA at NPL using a 100 MOhm resistor were sufficiently discrepant with the PTB calibrations to motivate a thorough investigation into the NPL traceability chain, which uncovered the error. This instructive episode illustrates a positive interplay between calibration and research activities and shows that cutting-edge calibration uncertainties must be supported by a vigorous research programme. It is also important for NMIs to maintain a comfortable buffer (at least a factor of 10) between their claimed uncertainty and the uncertainty that their customers require, so that small errors can be resolved without significant impact on measurement stakeholders."}

Employing a phenomenological environmental black-hole model with the hyperboloidal framework, we identify near-coalescence of both QNM eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, and directly demonstrate that the resonance produces enhanced mode contributions in the time domain, resulting in characteristic departures from exponentially damped oscillations. Our formulation further reveals that the EP frequency, given by the averaged value of the resonant modes, emerges as the physically relevant observable in the near-EP regime, and offers a robust foundation for modeling and extracting resonant ringdown signals."}

We find that the optimal frequency range for achieving cyclic deconvolution for most pulsars is between $\\sim$80$-$300 MHz, making low frequency observatories like uGMRT, LOFAR, and MWA the best-suited instruments for the technique. Moreover, we find that, as quantified by the total number sources with sufficient cyclic merits that are observed within the full deconvolution regime, uGMRT is likely the best current instrument for cyclic spectroscopy among the nine telescopes we considered, with LOFAR being the second best, and future telescopes like SKA-Low serving as the most likely eventual successors. The relatively high cyclic merit of the Crab Pulsar in the frequency ranges considered for GBT, MWA, LOFAR, and uGMRT suggests that some faster-spinning canonical pulsars may be able to achieve cyclic deconvolution, and we discuss potential follow-up analyses on other non-recycled pulsars. We conclude by advocating for near real-time cyclic spectroscopy backends to be considered for current and upcoming low frequency telescopes to increase the accessibility of this technique."}

However, downstream of the S-R step change $δ_{IEL}$ reaches $0.4 δ_0$ within $4δ_0$. In all cases, $δ_{IEL}$ does not reach the boundary layer thickness, even up to a distance of $45δ_0$ downstream of the step change, owing to persistent history effects within the frozen wake region."}

We measured the single-photon timing response and spatial charge distribution on segmented readout electrodes. The prompt timing peak exhibits a resolution of approximately 30 ps, with the overall timing structure explained by photoelectron propagation and back-scattering effects from the MCP input surface. We developed analytical models that describe the propagation of photoelectrons and the induced charge spread on the sensing electrodes, including secondary electron backscattering from the resistive anode. The model accurately reproduces the measured device properties and enables performance extrapolations for various detector geometries and dielectric properties. These results provide a predictive framework for optimizing MCP-PMTs for timing- and imaging-critical applications such as RICH detectors in high-energy physics and TOF-PET systems for medical imaging."}

We show that this result does not hold in the same class of solutions considered as physically viable near FLRW cosmological models, with the heat conduction vector interpreted as a peculiar velocity field.

Pushing into the sub-0.1mm regime is required to probe ultra-slow tidal dissipation, long-period librations, uHz-band gravitational waves. We develop a complete amplitude-modulated continuous-wave (AM-CW) framework for high-power LLR, including measurement models, estimators, a unified covariance description, and an observatory CONOPS. CW LLR is treated as RF phase metrology on a bright CW optical carrier: 2-way range and 1-way line-of-sight range-rate obtained from the phase and phase slope of a GHz-class modulation tone. The joint estimators are characterized by a covariance matrix decomposed into photon, atmospheric, instrumental, oscillator, nonlinearity contributions, mapped into subsystem requirements, including a closed-form range-rate bias from modulation-frequency slew across the ~2.56s round trip and synthetic-wavelength constraints on multi-tone nonlinearity. Using realistic photon budgets for a 1 kW, 1064 nm CW transmitter on a 1-m telescope ranging to 10cm corner-cube retroreflectors, we show that the photon-statistical floor for 2-way range at a GHz-class modulation frequency is at the level of a few-10 um in ~100s. With allocations to residual atmosphere and instrument, the resulting single-station 2-way precision is ~80 um, with range-rate sensitivities of ~0.1-1 um/s. Differential LLR between reflectors separated on the Moon by ~1000km can deliver 20-50 um and few (0.1-1) um/s differential range and range-rate. These precisions are realized across three representative regimes that span detected photon rates of (5-7) x 10^3-10^5 s^{-1} and are translated directly into hardware and CONOPS requirements for next-generation high-power AM-CW LLR."}

An equilibrium zero pressure-gradient (ZPG) TBL is generated at a reference location, followed by imposition of a Gaussian suction profile to create a separation bubble. The ZPG TBLs over the riblets and the benchmark smooth case have matched momentum thickness Reynolds number $Re_{θ_0} = 583$ (friction Reynolds number 224). We employ a well-validated spectral-element solver, and leverage its unstructured-grid nature to generate an optimal grid, based on the size of turbulent scales across the TBL. At the reference location, the T9 and T6 riblets respectively increase and reduce drag, with viscous-scaled spacings $52$ and $13$. We discover that for both riblet cases, the mean separation location occurs at a distance of $140θ_0$ downstream of the reference location, $18\\%$ shorter than the mean separation distance for the smooth case ($170θ_0$). This outcome is related to the progressive enhancement of the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) rollers over the riblets, owing to the continuous rise in the adverse pressure-gradient. The KH rollers penetrate into the turbulent separation bubble, with significantly larger size and coherence compared to their counterparts upstream of the mean separation location."}

Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%.

Gating can be driven by the applied voltage involving electrically tunable chemical reactions, achieved by selecting appropriate compounds within the nanopore volume. In particular, cyclic precipitation and dissolution of metal phosphates can be triggered by regulating cation transport through an applied transmembrane voltage, thereby enabling reversible pore gating. Under negative bias, metal phosphate precipitates form inside the pore, obstructing ion flow and reducing current. Switching the polarity dissolves the precipitates, restoring ionic conductance. This process effectively produces a nanofluidic diode characterized by a remarkably high rectification ratio. To probe these localized chemical reactions more directly, we employed a plasmonic nanopore that generates strong confined fields, enabling surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements within the nanopore volume during cyclic gating. These measurements not only validate the proposed in-pore chemistry but also highlight the potential of plasmonic nanopores as powerful tools for monitoring nanoscale chemical processes with high spatial resolution."}

The interior spacetime is smoothly matched with the exterior geometry calculated from the theoretical setup of $f(Q)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity using the Darmois-Israel junction conditions, ensuring the continuity of the metric functions and their derivatives at the stellar boundary. The physical viability of the model is examined through regularity, energy, and causality conditions, all of which are satisfied throughout the stellar interior. The study highlights how the pressure anisotropy, the propagation speeds of sound, and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff balance condition are interconnected, showing that the star remains in mechanical equilibrium only when the gravitational, hydrostatic, electric, and anisotropic contributions counterbalance one another appropriately. The dynamical stability of the configuration is further supported by the requirement $Γ> \\tfrac{4}{3}$ for the adiabatic index, indicating resilience against small radial perturbations.

The microwave is injected into the magnetron filter box using a self-designed injection structure, entering the resonant cavity through filament leads. The intrinsic isolation between the magnetrons output and filament is utilized as an isolator. No waveguide circulators or couplers between the injection source and the magnetron were used in the system, resulting in low cost and compact injection locking. Two types of injection structures were performed. The maximum locking bandwidth of 0.7 MHz was achieved at an injection ratio of 0.2.

Outdoor experiments achieved substantial volumetric reduction, yielding dried residues with over 75 wt% solid concentration. These results underscore the system's reliable performance against highly concentrated slurries, yet to be by conventional industrial methods, including flocculation and tail-lift drying. The integration of renewable energy coupled with efficient enhancement techniques makes the sailboat evaporator a scalable and sustainable pathway for industrial wastewater dewatering."}

Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $β$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $β$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $ω_R$ and the damping rate $-ω_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $β$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($ω_R \\approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments."}

Working directly with the Riemann-tensor two-point function and exploiting the extreme adiabaticity of cosmological GW propagation, we show that phase diffusion, rather than amplitude attenuation or mode mixing, is the unique leading-order imprint of microscopic curvature fluctuations. Our main theoretical result is a universality theorem: for any quantum-gravity model whose curvature fluctuations possess a finite correlation length, the accumulated phase variance grows linearly with distance, independent of the underlying microphysics. This diffusive scaling contrasts sharply with coherent astrophysical effects and with nonlocal models. The frequency exponent therefore becomes a clean spectral discriminator, separating string-foam recoil, holographic or scale-invariant noise, and causal-set discreteness. We obtain these results from first principles by evaluating the projected Riemann correlator along null geodesics and determining the exact conditions under which deviations from universality can arise. Finally, we outline a hierarchical Bayesian strategy for measuring this effect with LIGO, LISA, and Pulsar Timing Arrays. Although standard Planck-scale fluctuations remain far below current sensitivity, this framework provides a sharp and falsifiable test of exotic quantum-spacetime scenarios, particularly those with macroscopic correlation lengths or strong energy dependence."}

Most existing studies, however, are restricted to unbound orbits. The finite-distance deflection angle, which assumes both the source and observer to be located at finite distances, motivates us to investigate the bending of bound orbits. In this work, we broaden the GW method to bound orbits of massive particles in stationary axisymmetric (SAS) spacetimes, following our previous extension in static spherically symmetric (SSS) backgrounds [Huang et al., Phys. Rev. D 107, 104046 (2023)]. By employing our generalized GW method for SAS spacetimes [Huang et al., J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024)013], (a) We obtain a formula for the deflection angle of bound massive particles in SAS spacetimes by dividing bound orbits that azimuthally overlap with themselves into multiple non-overlapping segments. This division enables the application of the GW method -- originally developed for unbound orbits -- to each segment in a consistent manner. (b) We overcome the limitation associated with the loss of positive definiteness of the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler (JMRF) metric, which occurs because bound massive particles have energies below unity. To show the practical implementation of our approach, we carry out the calculation in Kerr spacetime and obtain the deflection angle between two arbitrary points along the bound orbit of massive particles."}

In this study, we establish a system in which the GCJG and a pressureless dark matter fluid exchange energy via a linear interaction term, $Q \\propto ρ_x$, being $ρ_{x}$ the dark energy density. By solving the conservation equations, we derive analytical expressions for the evolution of the dark energy and dark matter densities. The thermodynamic properties of this interacting system are then thoroughly analyzed. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that both dark components maintain positive temperatures, ensuring stability. Notably, the dark energy component transitions to a phantom regime in the past, a feature of interest for recent cosmological observations, without violating thermodynamic principles. The total entropy production is shown to be in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, an analysis of the specific heats suggests that while the dark matter sector remains thermodynamically stable, the dark energy sector undergoes a late-time phase transition, consistent with its entering into the phantom domain at effective level."}

In contrast to the widely used Kerr--Melvin metric, the Kerr--BR spacetime is of algebraic type~D, admits a clear asymptotic structure, and allows for a systematic analytic treatment of geodesics. By analyzing the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), we find that the external magnetic field consistently pushes the ISCO to larger radii \\(r_{\\rm ISCO}\\) for all spin configurations considered. Counterintuitively, despite this outward radial shift, the ISCO orbital frequency \\(Ω_{\\rm ISCO}\\) increases monotonically with the magnetic-field strength, leading to a robust ``blue-shift'' of the gravitational-wave cutoff frequency. We further show that retrograde orbits are significantly more sensitive to magnetic fields than prograde orbits, and identify a frequency crossover phenomenon in which magnetic corrections can invert the usual spin--frequency hierarchy at the ISCO. Finally, employing a semi-analytic adiabatic evolution scheme driven by exact geodesic relations and a leading-order quadrupole flux, we generate inspiral waveforms and quantify the substantial dephasing induced by the magnetic field. Our results indicate that large-scale magnetic environments can leave observable imprints in EMRI signals for future space-based detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, and that neglecting such effects in waveform models may introduce non-negligible biases in parameter estimation, particularly for the black-hole spin."}

Similar modulations may also arise from orbital eccentricity, raising the possibility of degeneracies that could lead to false microlensing claims. We investigate the extent to which eccentric binary black hole (BBH) signals can mimic microlensing signatures produced by an isolated point-mass lens. With a simulated population of eccentric signals using numerical relativity simulations and \\texttt{TEOBResumS-Dalí} waveform model, we perform a Bayesian model-comparison study, supported by a complementary \\textit{mismatch} analysis. We find a strong degeneracy for high eccentricities, low total masses, and high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs): under these conditions, quasicircular microlensed model can be strongly favored over quasicircular unlensed model, even when the true signal is unlensed. For moderate SNRs ($\\sim 30$), binaries with $M_\\mathrm{tot}\\lesssim 100\\,M_\\odot$ and eccentricity $e \\gtrsim 0.4$ are particularly susceptible to misclassifications. In such cases, inferred microlens parameters exhibit well-constrained posteriors despite being unphysical. Crucially, the degeneracy is completely removed when the recovery uses waveform models that incorporate eccentricity, which overwhelmingly favors the eccentric hypothesis over microlensing. Our results demonstrate that any event exhibiting strong Bayesian evidence for microlensing should also be analyzed with eccentric waveform models and vice-versa to avoid false positives and biased astrophysical inference.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories."}

In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\\dot{\\mathcal{R}}\\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar.

We then formulate the problem as a boundary value problem (BVP) and highlight the numerical pathologies that may arise, together with possible strategies to prevent them.
