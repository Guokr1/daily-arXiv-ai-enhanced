Foundation Models are programs trained on very large and\nbroad datasets with an extensive number of parameters. Once built, these\npowerful, and flexible, models can be utilized in less resource-intensive ways\nto build many different, downstream applications that can integrate previously\ndisparate, multimodal data. The development of these applications can be done\nrapidly and with a much lower demand for machine learning expertise. And the\nnecessary infrastructure and models themselves are already being established\nwithin agencies such as NASA and ESA. At NASA this work is across several\ndivisions of the Science Mission Directorate including the NASA Goddard and\nINDUS Large Language Models and the Prithvi Geospatial Foundation Model. And\nESA initiatives to bring Foundation Models to Earth observations has led to the\ndevelopment of TerraMind. A workshop was held by the NASA Ames Research Center\nand the SETI Institute, in February 2025, to investigate the potential of\nFoundation Models for astrobiological research and to determine what steps\nwould be needed to build and utilize such a model or models. This paper shares\nthe findings and recommendations of that workshop, and describes clear\nnear-term, and future opportunities in the development of a Foundation Model\n(or Models) for astrobiology applications. These applications would include a\nbiosignature, or life characterization, task, a mission development and\noperations task, and a natural language task for integrating and supporting\nastrobiology research needs."}

In this\nwork, we analyze the dynamical evolution of locally rotationally symmetric\nanisotropic cosmological models of Bianchi type I (flat curvature) and Bianchi\ntype III (open curvature) within a noncommutative phase space framework\ncharacterized by a deformation parameter gamma. Using a Hamiltonian formulation\nbased on Schutz formalism for a perfect radiation fluid, we introduce\nnoncommutative Poisson brackets that allow for geometric corrections to\ncommutative dynamics.

We\npresent a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific\nanalysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and\nwe use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,\noptical, and infrared wavelengths.

This is because only the high\nfrequency Fourier modes contribute to the lensed signal. Therefore, the strong\nlensing system serves as a high-pass filter for the memory signal. Due to the\nstep function like behavior of the unlensed memory waveform, the lensed\nwaveform possesses characteristic morphology that is dependent on the type of\nthe image, and independent of the lens model and the binary system. That is,\nfor each type of the lensed image, the lensed memory waveform has an\napproxmiate reflection symmetry about a symmetrical axis in the time domain.\nMore specifically, for the type I and type III images, the lensed memory\nsignals are nearly odd under the reflection, while the type II signal is\nroughly even. In addition, at the symmetrical axis, the sign of the slope for\ntype I image is different from that for the type III image. These universal\ncharacteristic features would help determine the type of the lensed image. This\nis particularly because the memory waveform can be well approximated by a\nsuitable step function, which involves two parameters. In addition, the\ndetection of multiple images by the space-borne interferometer would also be\nhelpful.
