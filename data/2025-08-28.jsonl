We\nconducted color matching experiments with a single observer, both with and\nwithout a spectral filter in front of a bipartite field. Using a novel\ncomputational approach, we estimated the filter transmittance and\ntransformation matrix necessary to convert unfiltered CMFs to filtered CMFs.\nStatistical analysis revealed good agreement between estimated and measured\nfilter characteristics, particularly in central wavelength regions. Applying\nthis methodology to compare between Stiles and Burch 1955 (SB1955) mean\nobserver CMFs and our previously published \"ICVIO\" mean observer CMFs, we\nidentified a \"yellow\" (short-wavelength suppressing) filter that effectively\ntransforms between these datasets. This finding aligns with our hypothesis that\nobserved differences between the CMF sets are attributable to age-related lens\nyellowing (average observer age: 49 years in ICVIO versus 30 years in SB1955).\nOur approach enables efficient representation of observer variability through a\nsingle filter rather than three separate functions, offering potentially\nreduced experimental overhead while maintaining accuracy in characterizing\nindividual color vision differences."}

A growing body of research has\nfocused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of\nDM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly\nalter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal\ndeformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during\nbinary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that,\nfor the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using\nreal GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,\nand GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\\chi}$, and\nparticle mass, $m_{\\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a\nscalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on\n$F_{\\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating\nthat different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in\ndifferent ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM\nhalo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105\nand GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding\nstrong upper bounds on $F_{\\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale\n$m_{\\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to\nprobing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations."}

Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time\nreparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We\ncompute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations,\nfinding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including\nscale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our\nresults highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to\nprobe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR."}

For this purpose, we derive the field equations of a particular model\nwith cubic order invariants and demonstrate the existence of analytical\nsolutions which display an interaction between the intrinsic and extrinsic\nangular momentum parameters in the gravitational action, in analogy to the\nspin-orbit interaction arising from atomic and nuclear systems. Due to the\nhighly nonlinear character of the field equations under stationary and\naxisymmetric conditions, we focus on a degenerate case which simplifies their\ncomplexity, at the cost of constraining the geometry to the Kerr space-time.\nThereby, our results indicate more general solutions with a spin-orbit\ninteraction beyond the Kerr space-time are expected to arise in the\nnondegenerate models of Poincar\\'e gauge theory."}

Our results are consistent with a non-detection.\nWe set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$ and translate\nthese to upper limits on neutron star ellipticity and on r-mode amplitude.
