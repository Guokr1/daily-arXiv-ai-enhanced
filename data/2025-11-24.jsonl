Initial astrobiology centered investigations focused on detecting biosignatures in the Martian soil with the Viking lander. The field now encompasses identification of biosignatures throughout the galaxy and habitable worlds, planets with sufficient liquid water and prebiotic chemistry to support life. This evolution mirrors the improvement in our understanding of environments that may harbor life. The bulk planetary chemistry governs the habitability of a planet, which is in turn set by the early solar system environment and planet formation processes. Therefore, investigations of solar and exoplanetary systems as a whole would provide insights into the factors that make a planet habitable. Bulk planetary chemistry govern planetary atmospheres, core sizes, magnetic fields, heat engines, volatile inventories, and silicate mantle compositions. We therefore advocate for investigations of formation conditions that establish planetary chemistry, and by extension, habitability."}

Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) offers a complementary approach: it performs well in scarce-data regimes and yields physically interpretable representations of gravitational-wave morphology. Here we present CLAWDIA (Comprehensive Library for the Analysis of Waves via Dictionary-based Algorithms), an open-source Python framework that integrates SDL-based denoising and classification under realistic detector noise. We systematise previously isolated SDL workflows into a unified, modular environment with a consistent, user-friendly interface. The current release provides several time-domain denoising strategies based on LASSO-regularised sparse coding and a classifier based on Low-Rank Shared Dictionary Learning. A companion toolbox, GWADAMA, supports dataset construction and realistic conditioning of real and simulated interferometer data. We demonstrate CLAWDIA's performance by denoising the signal from binary neutron star event GW170817 and by classifying families of instrumental glitches from LIGO's third observing run, highlighting robustness at low signal-to-noise ratios. CLAWDIA is intended as a community-driven, interoperable library extensible to additional tasks, including detection and parameter estimation."}

Traditional methods rely on hardware-specific code or pre-calculated stellar model templates to solve this problem, making them model-dependent and not suitable for large datasets that may contain new classes of objects. To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands. Implementations of GSPICE in both Python and IDL can be found here http://github.com/dfink/gspice."}

By adding an amorphous Si (a-Si) buffer to the n-InN/p-Si structure, we have improved the photovoltaic performance of the resulting devices while maintaining their material quality. We have firstly optimized the deposition of Si on Si(100) by DC sputtering, obtaining an amorphous material with bandgap energy of 1.39 eV. Then we have studied the influence of the thickness of the a-Si buffer layer (0-25 nm) on the structural, morphological, electrical, and optical properties of InN nanowires on Si (100) substrates. With the use of a 15-nm buffer, n-InN/a-Si/p-Si nanowire heterojunction solar cells exhibit a promising short-circuit current density of 17 mA/cm2, open circuit voltage of 0.37 V and fill factor of 35.5%, pointing to a power-conversion efficiency of 2.3% under 1-sun (AM 1.5G) illumination.

These expressions are then employed to compute two gauge-invariant observables for quasi-circular orbits: the binding energy and the fractional periastron advance. We also use them to compare two spin-gauge choices: the well-known Damour-Jaranowski-Schäfer ($\\rm DJS$) gauge, in which the gyro-gravitomagnetic functions are independent of the orbital angular momentum, and the alternative anti-$\\rm DJS$ (or $\\overline{\\rm DJS}$) gauge, designed to reproduce in the test-mass limit the spin-orbit interaction of a spinning test particle in a Kerr background.

In addition to recording lightning flash currents on the monitored turbine, the system is frequently triggered by electromagnetic disturbances caused by nearby lightning flashes. These include direct flashes to two neighboring turbines that share the same cable connection to the substation and have interconnected grounding systems with buried bare conductor, as well as cloud-to-ground flashes to soil near cable routes, where the resulting electromagnetic fields couple onto the cables, causing surges to propagate to the monitored turbine. The camera occasionally captures failed upward connecting leaders from the monitored turbine during these lightning events. This paper presents three cases of flashes to two neighboring wind turbines and two cases of cloud-to-ground flashes to nearby soil, all of which induced electromagnetic transients that propagated to the monitored turbine. Failed upward connecting leaders were observed in some of these cases. This paper provides observational analysis, providing Rogowski measurements of electromagnetic disturbances and failed leader currents, complemented by high-speed camera and lightning location system data."}

These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging. The Ajisai satellite provides an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating these techniques due to its simple geometry and well constrained spin behaviour. We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories."}

Within the LISA sensitivity range, the GWB signal is a flat or a broken power law, parametrized by four fundamental quantities: the Hubble parameter at the curvature bounce $H_1$, the axion mass $m$, the initial amplitude of the axion field $σ_i$ and the exponent $β$ governing the high-energy growth of the dilaton and the dynamics of the internal dimensions. We determine the posterior distributions of these parameters based on how LISA would detect such signal. Including the galactic and extra-galactic foregrounds in the analysis, the most stringent constraints on $H_1$, $σ_i$ and $β$ are obtained when the signal exhibits a left-bend feature, while for $m$ this happens for a right-bend feature. Relative uncertainties reach $ΔH_1/H_1 ,\\,Δm/m \\sim 18\\%$ at $68\\%$ confidence level under favourable conditions. LISA will thus be capable of placing significant constraints on the pre-big-bang model, potentially providing empirical hints of string theory in the case of detection."}

The Nab experiment at the Spallation Neutron Source is designed to precisely extract the first matrix element $V_{ud}$ and shed light on experimental tensions within the neutron beta decay dataset. Nab's asymmetric spectrometer allows coincident reconstruction of the decay proton and electron energies, which will be used to determine the electron-neutrino correlation coefficient, and thus (with the neutron lifetime) determine $V_{ud}$. This unique approach has provided a more comprehensive view of neutron beta decay, including a first observation of the full momentum phase space of the decay above detector thresholds and limits on exotic neutron states.

To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients.

In polymer dielectrics, triboelectricity can be further amplified by incorporating high-dielectric and polar materials for functional adaptability. Conventional dielectrics, including liquid crystals (LCs), offer limited improvement for triboelectrification, whereas the breakthrough ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NF-LCs), with giant spontaneous polarization and high dielectric constant, act as highly effective charge boosters. Here, we introduce NF-LC (DIO) as a functional filler in a PVDF-based TENG. Increasing DIO content progressively grows the electroactive phase and effective polarization in PVDF and defines a marked improvement in TENGs electrical performances through favourable dipolar alignment and strengthened charge-trap effects. The optimized composite film achieves an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.1 kV, short-circuit current of 50 micro Amp, and power density of 110 W/m2 - seven times higher than pure PVDF. The device exhibits excellent charge-storage capability, powers over 500 LEDs without power management.

Using optical profilometry with curvature fitting, we extract the stress gradient (sigma1) and generate orientation-resolved stress maps across multiple film thicknesses (100 nm, 220 nm, and 460 nm). For films in the 220 to 460 nm range, we identify stress-free in-plane orientations near approximately 55 degrees and 125 degrees, enabling extremely flat suspended beams. In contrast, ultra-thin 100 nm films exhibit shifted stress-free orientations near approximately 20 degrees and 160 degrees. Leveraging these orientations, we demonstrate very long suspended beams up to 2 cm in length, 10 micrometers in width, and 460 nm in thickness without collapse. These results establish in-plane stress anisotropy and thickness selection in TFLN as practical design levers for mechanically stable, scalable, and stress-managed microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)."}

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy."}

The next frontier for science archives is to enable searches not only on observational metadata, but also on the content of the observations themselves. As a step in this direction, we have implemented morphological image similarity search into the ALMA Science Archive (ASA). To achieve this we use self-supervised contrastive affine-transformation-independent representation learning of source morphologies with a deep neural network. For a given image on the ASA web interface, astronomers are presented with a summary view of the morphologically most similar images. Each time an astronomer selects an additional image from that view, the display is instantly updated to show the images most similar to the combination of the selected images. Each selection thus refines the similarity display according to the scientific needs of the astronomer. This is the first time image similarity search has been offered in an astronomical science archive."}

Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes."}

These particles, with energies exceeding 10$^{20}$~eV, provide insights into extreme astrophysical processes but remain challenging to detect due to their low flux. At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements. Future efforts include the POEMMA space mission, designed for stereoscopic observations of UHECRs and multi-messenger phenomena, the PBR experiment, which integrates radio detection and is scheduled to fly in 2027, and the M-EUSO satellite mission, proposed to ESA."}

The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them. It then turns out that there is no reason to ignore the volume measure existing on the differentiable manifold on which the theory of gravity and matter fields is built. This idea has far-reaching implications. The goals of this paper are: 1) to provide a clear mathematical and conceptual justification for TMT; 2) to collect in a single article some of the main results of TMT obtained over the past 25 years."}

The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities."}

Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables."}

The different mechanical parts are introduced and examined from the broader literature of previous work.

The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two developments.CLEAN remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended."}

Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation."}

We first discuss the potential of DAS in the context of particle accelerators, gravitational wave detection experiments and research campuses. Next, we present the results of our seismic measurement campaign conducted with our proto-network, which involved the probing of over 12 km of fiber, in May 2021. This campaign was conducted by the Hamburg WAVE initiative in Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld and included DESY, the European XFEL, PETRA III and the University of Hamburg. Our proto-network confirms the ability to observe natural, anthropogenic, and infrastructural vibrations and how and where these couple into different parts of the heterogeneously set up fiber network. We also present results on a study of noise and motion coupling aspects of DAS probing double-redundant fiber loops in a unique environment, the European XFEL. Our results show that DAS greatly benefits research campuses and large scientific infrastructures and they highlight the opportunities and challenges of implementing and operating such seismic networks."}

We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths, in order to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We demonstrate that networks with an L-shaped ET design have stronger parity violation constraining power than networks with a triangular ET design, particularly seen when studying ET designs on their own."}

Data collected in two beam test campaigns conducted in 2018 and 2021 at the H4 and H2 beam lines of the CERN SPS are analyzed. Time and energy resolutions are measured on a $5\\times 5$ matrix of lead tungstate crystals equipped with prototypes of the new front end readout electronics, using electron and pion beams of energies spanning from 25 to 250 GeV. In both campaigns the constant term of the energy resolution is measured to be better than 0.6% and the time resolution for electrons with energies above 50 GeV is measured to be better than 30 ps, fulfilling the design requirements."}

Unbiased source property estimation relies on the ability to correctly identify and characterize these artifacts and remove them if necessary. To this end, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has implemented candidate vetting for all significant candidates to identify the presence of artifacts and assess the need for mitigation. The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs."}

LEGEND operates High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors bare in liquid argon. $^{42}$K is attracted by the HPGe detectors' electric fields, and drifts toward the germanium surface, where it undergoes beta decay. LEGEND-1000 will mitigate $^{42}$K-induced background by using underground-sourced argon, depleted in cosmogenic isotopes. If underground argon is not available, mitigation techniques must be employed. Poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) enclosures were proposed to hinder the ion drift, decrease the beta-particle's energy, and produce scintillation light. In this paper, we report on operating two HPGe detectors, both bare and PEN-enclosed, in $^{42}$Ar-enriched liquid argon, and find no evidence for deterioration of energy stability or resolution due to the enclosures. We monitor the beta and gamma rates of $^{42}$K, find complex time-dependencies extending to roughly 30 days after applying the HPGe detectors' high-voltage, and qualitatively demonstrate the $^{42}$K suppression capabilities of enclosures."}
