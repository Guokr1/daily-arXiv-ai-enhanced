However, due to\nthe high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its\nsymmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically\nsignificant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example\nis the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to\nlead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we\npropose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the\nstationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance\nunder null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions,\nthe classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence\nis covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields\nan axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave\ndisplays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the\nexterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a\nspecial case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole.

Specifically, we are looking at scenarios that don't rely on\nexotic factors, like having a mass shell at the throat or allowing particles\nand antiparticles to coexist without annihilation. To do this, we are\nconstructing wormholes with double power-law density distributions, drawing\ninspiration from the Dehnen-type dark matter halo in the framework of\ngeneralized geometry-matter coupling gravity. Our investigation carefully\nconsiders the challenges of traversability and stability, as well as the roles\nof exotic matter, the exoticity parameter, and the anisotropy parameter. We\nhave discovered solutions that describe asymmetric, asymptotically flat\ntraversable wormholes, supported by a smooth metric and double power-law\ndensity distributions. These solutions successfully avoid the problems, giving\nus hope that such wormholes could actually exist in nature."}
