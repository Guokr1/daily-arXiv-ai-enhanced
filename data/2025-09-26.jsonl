Quite surprisingly, there\nappears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually\ncontributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on\nvarious experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first\nproviding a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms\ncontributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the\ngate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue\nby suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena.\nBased on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis\nvalues have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under\narbitrary conditions.

However, these\neccentric harmonics are not directly accessible in numerical relativity (NR)\nsimulations or current eccentric waveform models. Using the recently developed\ndata-driven framework gwMiner, which combines singular value decomposition,\ninput from post-Newtonian theory, and signal processing techniques, we extract\neccentric harmonics from eccentric, aligned-spin waveforms for six different\nspherical harmonic modes: (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). We\ndemonstrate that the phase (frequency) of each eccentric harmonic takes the\nform $j\\,\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda} + \\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ ($j\\,f_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}\n+ f_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$), where $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ ($f_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$)\ncorresponds to the secular orbital phase (frequency), and $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm\necc}$ ($f_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$) is an additional contribution that depends solely\non the eccentricity. We further find that $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ is the same\nacross different spherical harmonic modes $(\\ell, m)$, whereas the eccentric\ncorrection term $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ scales with $\\ell$. Using\neffective-one-body dynamics, we further show that $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\lambda}$ is\nnothing but the relativistic anomaly and $\\phi_{\\ell,m,\\rm ecc}$ is related to\nthe precession advances."}

For k-essence, in order a\nperturbative Kerr--Schild type solution to become exact, the k-essence\nLagrangian was either linear in the kinetic term (with the Kerr--Schild\ncongruence autoparallel) or unrestricted, provided the scalar gradient along\nthe congruence vanishes. A similar reasoning for the pure kinetic braiding\ncontribution leads to either a vanishing Lagrangian or a scalar which is\nconstant along the congruence. From the scalar dynamics we also derive an\naccompanying constraint. Finally, we discuss pp-waves, an example of\nKerr--Schild spacetime generated by a constant k-essence along the Kerr--Schild\ncongruence with vanishing Lagrangian. This allows for the construction of a\nFock-type space, consisting of a tower of Kerr--Schild maps first yielding a\nvacuum pp-wave from flat spacetime; next a k-essence generated pp-wave from the\nvacuum pp-wave; and finally an arbitrary number of k-essence pp-waves with\ndifferent, retarded time dependent metric functions."}

The model parameters are constrained using\ntwo observational datasets: DS1 (Pantheon+ + Cosmic Chronometers + DESI BAO +\n$\\sigma_8$) and DS2 (DS1 + R22), employing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nanalysis. The results indicate that the proposed hybrid model successfully\ngenerates a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, consistent\nwith current observations.

The model is constructed from an\naction inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired\nscenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields,\nwhile both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the\ngravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble\nhorizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov\ncoefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in\nan expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of\ngravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons.\nUsing this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation\nacross all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant\ngravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the\ninflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions,\ni.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting\nenergy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the\nplanned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave\nobservatories.
