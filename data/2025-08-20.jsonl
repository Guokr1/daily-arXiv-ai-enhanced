Geomagnetic index predictions were made in real-time\nwith 7 and 15 hour lead-times, presenting a large improvement over current\nL1-based warning times of less than one hour. We successfully captured the\nobserved geomagnetic response profiles, although underestimated the intensity\nof the storm during already disturbed conditions.

However, it requires complex and often\nmanual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and\npropagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI\narrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and\nexisting pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision.\nWe present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for\ncontinuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge\nof the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and\nheterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives\nsuch as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python\nusing ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow\nin a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline\nalso performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification,\nand generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a\nrepresentative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to\n1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated\nobservations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over\n91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in\nat least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated\nvisibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing\ntime was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and\nscalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated\ncalibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier\nfor VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible."}

Experiments conducted on an LPBF\nsystem involved in situ acquisition of airborne AE and ex situ porosity imaging\nvia X-ray computed tomography (XCT), synchronized spatiotemporally through\nphotodiode signals with submillisecond precision. We introduce KHLineNum, a\nspatially resolved porosity metric defined as the number of KH pores per unit\nscan length, which serves as a physically meaningful indicator of the severity\nof KH porosity in geometries and scanning strategies. Using AE scalogram data\nand scan speed, we trained a lightweight convolutional neural network to\npredict KHLineNum with millisecond-scale temporal resolution, achieving an\nR-squared value exceeding 0.8.

As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant\ntargets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science\ngoals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the\nsimultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the\nfield of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000\nindividually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.\n  The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce\nunwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting\nvaluable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the\naffected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to\nprevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces\nNIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of\nmasking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.\n  More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical\nprocedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This\nexperience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected\nrows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of\nmultiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.\n  As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable\nWorlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain\nrelevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation\noperations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning,\nand describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued\nscience productivity from this unique payload."}

In this study, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft with\nself-locking gear (SLG) resonators is proposed, where a simple gear-shifting\nmechanism replaces complex tuning methods to achieve low-frequency torsional\nvibration suppression in tunable frequency ranges. First, as the key components\nof the SLG resonator, six inner curved beams are designed to provide precisely\ntunable torsional stiffness of the resonator through their deformed shapes\ncontrolled by shifting the gear teeth on the edge of the resonator. Also, based\non the gear-shifting mechanism, the SLG resonator achieves resonant frequency\nmodulation and opens tunable low-frequency torsional band gaps consistent with\ntheoretical predictions. Then, the SLG resonators are periodically attached to\na uniform shaft to construct a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft, whose dynamic\nresponse is obtained using numerical simulations to evaluate its torsional wave\nattenuation performance. Finally, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft prototype\nis fabricated and experiments are carried out to study the propagation\ncharacteristics of torsional waves therein. Through the consistency observed\namong theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results,\nthe gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft is found to exhibit excellent attenuation\nperformance in the tunable low-frequency band gaps.

A comprehensive graphical analysis is conducted\nusing multiple values of the Rastall and charge parameters. Notably, the\nfindings of this study align with those predicted by Einstein's theory. More\nappealingly, the Rastall theory demonstrates its superiority in the presence of\ncharge under model 2 when it is compared with the general theory of relativity."}

Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder\nour ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have\ninstrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear\nfollowing detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their\norigins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse\nplatform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new\nglitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the\ndetectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for\nmachine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse\nempowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring\nchanges in data quality in the LIGO detectors."}

Even though we recover a\ncommon-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz\ngravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves.\nTherefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in\nthe most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\\%\ncredibility upper limit of $\\approx 7 \\times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive\nto supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\\geq 10^9M_{\\odot}$ up\nto a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and\n200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times\nbetter sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based\non the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a\nkey role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of\nnanohertz gravitational wave astronomy."}

Since this operation can model the quasiperiodic\noscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the surrounding accretion disc, we then employ\nthe MCMC simulation to fit the theoretical results with three QPO events,\nincluding GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226 and H1743-322, and constrain the\ncharacteristic radius $r$, black hole mass $M$ and spinning parameter $a$, and\nthe Horndeski hair parameter $h$. Our constraint on the Horndeski hair\nparameter is much tighter than QPOs simulation from the existed accretion\nmodels, suggesting slight deviation from classical Kerr black hole."}
