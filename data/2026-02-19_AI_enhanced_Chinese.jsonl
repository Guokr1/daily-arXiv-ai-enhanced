However, their low surface brightness, as well as contamination from compact sources and imaging artefacts, makes their detection challenging. The sheer volume of data from instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array will render traditional manual-inspection based detection methods infeasible. This paper introduces a novel machine learning approach that uses active learning to rapidly identify diffuse emission candidates from a small, optimally-selected subset of data. We apply the self-supervised deep learning algorithm Bootstrap Your Own Latent to extract features from source cutouts in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS). We then pass these features through the Astronomaly: Protege anomaly detection framework to identify the final candidates. Using a human-labelled set, we evaluate our pipeline on high-resolution (~7''), convolved (15''), and combined-feature MGCLS datasets. Interestingly, the high-resolution features identify diffuse sources more efficiently than the convolved resolution, which are in turn outperformed by the combined features. Of the top 100 sources ranked by Protege, 99% exhibit diffuse characteristics, with 55% confirmed as cluster-related emission. Our work shows that Protege can identify diffuse emission with minimal human labelling effort, offering a powerful, scalable tool capable of detecting both known and novel diffuse radio sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff08\u5982\u5c04\u7535\u6655\u3001\u9057\u8ff9\u3001\u8ff7\u4f60\u6655\uff09\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u5185\u975e\u70ed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6e4d\u6d41\u548c\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f4e\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u6e90\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u4f7f\u5f97\u63a2\u6d4b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\u9635\u5217\u7b49\u4eea\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5BYOL\u4eceMeerKAT\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165Astronomaly: Protege\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Protege\u6392\u540d\u524d100\u7684\u6e90\u4e2d\uff0c99%\u663e\u793a\u5f25\u6563\u7279\u5f81\uff0c55%\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bc6\u522b\u5f25\u6563\u8f90\u5c04\u3002", "conclusion": "Protege\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u52aa\u529b\u8bc6\u522b\u5f25\u6563\u5c04\u7535\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u5c04\u7535\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u672a\u6765\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5c04\u7535\u5de1\u5929\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Airless planetary bodies are directly exposed to solar wind ions, which can scatter or become implanted upon impact with the regolith-covered surface, while also sputtering surface atoms.\n  Aims. We construct a semi-analytical model for the scattering of ions of hundreds of eV and the sputtering of surface atoms, both resulting in the emission of negative ions from the lunar surface. Our model contains a novel description of the scattering process that is physics-based and constrained by observations.\n  Methods. We use data from the Negative Ions at the Lunar Surface (NILS) instrument on the Chang'e-6 lander to update prior knowledge of ion scattering and sputtering from lunar regolith through Bayesian inference.\n  Results. Our model shows good agreement with the NILS data. A precipitating solar wind proton has roughly a 22% chance of scattering from the lunar surface in any charge state, and about an 8% chance of sputtering a surface hydrogen atom. The resulting ratio of scattered to sputtered hydrogen flux is eta_sc / eta_sp = 1.5 for a proton speed of 300 km/s. We find a high probability (7-20%) that a hydrogen atom leaves the surface negatively charged. The angular emission distributions at near-grazing angles for both scattered and sputtered fluxes are controlled by surface roughness. Our model also indicates significant inelastic energy losses for hydrogen interacting with the regolith, suggesting a longer effective path length than previously assumed. Finally, we estimate a surface binding energy of 5.5 eV, consistent with the observations.\n  Conclusions. Our model describes the scattering and sputtering of particles of any charge state from any homogeneous, multi-species surface. Using NILS data, we successfully applied the model to update our understanding of solar wind interacting with lunar regolith, and the emission of negative hydrogen ions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u79bb\u5b50\u5728\u6708\u7403\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u6e85\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ae6\u5a25\u516d\u53f7NILS\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u6708\u7403\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u79bb\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u5927\u6c14\u884c\u661f\u4f53\u76f4\u63a5\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u79bb\u5b50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u79bb\u5b50\u4f1a\u4e0e\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8868\u9762\u53d1\u751f\u6563\u5c04\u6216\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6e85\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u539f\u5b50\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u79bb\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u8868\u9762\u539f\u5b50\u6e85\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ae6\u5a25\u516d\u53f7\u7740\u9646\u5668\u4e0a\u7684NILS\u4eea\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u6708\u7403\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u79bb\u5b50\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u6e85\u5c04\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eNILS\u6570\u636e\u543b\u5408\u826f\u597d\uff1a\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u8d28\u5b50\u6709\u7ea622%\u6982\u7387\u4ece\u6708\u7403\u8868\u9762\u6563\u5c04\uff08\u4efb\u4f55\u7535\u8377\u6001\uff09\uff0c\u7ea68%\u6982\u7387\u6e85\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u6c22\u539f\u5b50\uff1b\u6563\u5c04\u4e0e\u6e85\u5c04\u6c22\u901a\u91cf\u6bd4\u4e3a1.5\uff1b\u6c22\u539f\u5b50\u79bb\u5f00\u8868\u9762\u5e26\u8d1f\u7535\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e3a7-20%\uff1b\u8fd1\u63a0\u5c04\u89d2\u53d1\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\u53d7\u8868\u9762\u7c97\u7cd9\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u6c22\u4e0e\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u975e\u5f39\u6027\u80fd\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u4e3a5.5 eV\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u4f55\u7535\u8377\u6001\u7c92\u5b50\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5747\u5300\u591a\u7ec4\u5206\u8868\u9762\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u6e85\u5c04\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5229\u7528NILS\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u4e0e\u6708\u7403\u98ce\u5316\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d1f\u6c22\u79bb\u5b50\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Interferometers have enabled observations of stars at various stages of evolution, as well as studies of binary stars, circumstellar disks, and active galactic nuclei. The CHARA Array is a long-baseline interferometric array at the Mount Wilson Observatory, USA. At the core of CHARA operations are the delay lines, which equalize the optical path length for all telescopes as the Earth rotates and compensate for optical path variations induced by atmospheric turbulence. We report recent upgrades and performance of the CHARA Array optical delay lines for high-precision interferometric observations. The legacy system had been operational for over two decades, and it was increasingly difficult to acquire replacement parts. Beginning in mid-2021, the control system underwent a major upgrade, replacing the aging VME-based architecture with a modern hybrid FPGA and Linux-based system; this modernization continued through the end of 2024. We describe hardware/software changes, the servo architecture, and lab/on-sky performance. The upgraded system achieves residual delay line cart tracking errors of $\\sim12$~nm, the same level as the legacy system, and a control bandwidth of 100-130~Hz, allowing fringe tracking across the R, H, and K bands. Initial commissioning revealed key issues such as metrology time-tick jitter and vibration-induced visibility loss, which were diagnosed and resolved. We note ongoing and future efforts to extend baselines up to 1~km and support advanced observing modes such as dual-field interferometry and nulling.

Despite extensive observational work, quantitatively comparing FD morphology across events and linking it to storm severity remains challenging due to heterogeneous station responses, coverage gaps, and the multivariate nature of the network. This work introduces a graph-based event representation in which each FD is mapped to an event network constructed from pairwise dissimilarities between station response time series. A controlled sparse backbone is obtained via the minimum spanning tree, enabling comparable event graphs across cases. From each graph, a compact set of geometric/topological fingerprints is computed, including global integration measures, spectral summaries, mesoscopic structure, centrality aggregates, and complexity descriptors.\n  Predictive skill is assessed using strict leave-one-event-out validation over a pre-defined grid of distance metrics and distance-domain transformations, with selection criteria fixed \\emph{a priori}. The proposed fingerprints exhibit measurable signal for three tasks: (i) multi-class classification of geomagnetic storm intensity (G3/G4/G5) with moderate but consistent performance and errors dominated by adjacent categories; (ii) stronger binary severity screening ($\\ge$G4 vs.\\ G3) with high sensitivity to severe events; and (iii) drop regression with partial least squares achieving positive explained variance relative to a fold-wise mean baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790Forbush\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55/\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u78c1\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "Forbush\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u65e5\u5195\u7269\u8d28\u629b\u5c04\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5b50\u76d1\u6d4b\u7ad9\u54cd\u5e94\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u8986\u76d6\u95f4\u9699\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u91cf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u98ce\u66b4\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2aFD\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7531\u7ad9\u70b9\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u5f02\u6027\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u6811\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u63a7\u7a00\u758f\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55/\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u6574\u5408\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u8c31\u6458\u8981\u3001\u4ecb\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u805a\u5408\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1a1) \u5730\u78c1\u98ce\u66b4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\uff08G3/G4/G5\uff09\u5177\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2) \u4e25\u91cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e8c\u5143\u7b5b\u67e5\uff08\u2265G4 vs. G3\uff09\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u964d\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aForbush\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5173\u8054\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u5730\u78c1\u98ce\u66b4\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In contrast to curvature-based modifications of General Relativity, teleparallel gravity attributes gravitation to spacetime torsion encoded in the torsion scalar $T$. By reconstructing viable $f(T)$ functions corresponding to analytically prescribed nonsingular bouncing scale factors and coupling the geometry to a minimally interacting canonical scalar field, we demonstrate that asymmetric scalar field dynamics between expansion and contraction phases give rise to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral $\\oint p_\u03c6\\, dV$ over complete cycles. This hysteresis manifests as closed loops in the $(w_\u03c6,a)$ plane, signifying thermodynamic memory and irreversibility. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, establish exact bounce and turnaround conditions, and discuss the implications of torsion-induced hysteresis for the cosmological arrow of time.

Inference at the sensor edge determines experimental data collection efficiency by deciding which information to save for further analysis. Particle tracking detectors at the Large Hadron Collider exemplify this challenge: pixelated silicon sensors generate rich spatiotemporal ionization patterns, yet most of this information is discarded due to data-rate limitations. Concurrently, advancements in co-design tools provide rapid turn-around for incorporating machine learning into application-specific integrated circuits, motivating designs for particle detectors with new integrated technologies. We demonstrate that neural networks embedded in the front-end electronics can infer charged-particle kinematic parameters from a single silicon layer. We regress hit positions and incident angles with calibrated uncertainties, while satisfying stringent constraints on numerical precision, latency, and silicon area.

The primary objective was to evaluate the performance of MPPCs (Silicon Photomultipliers) as robust, low-voltage alternatives to traditional photomultiplier tubes for detecting faint scintillation light. The optoelectronic properties of the sensors were analyzed, including single-photoelectron gain calibration and dark count rate measurements, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. By embedding wavelength-shifting fibers to enhance light collection efficiency, the system was configured into a three-fold coincidence telescope. The angular distribution of the cosmic ray muon flux was measured to validate the detector's stability and geometric acceptance. Fitting the experimental data to a $\\bm{\\cos^n(\u03b8)}$ distribution yielded an angular exponent of $\\bm{n = 1.44 \\pm 0.06}$, consistent with literature values.

We show that a minimal extension based on fractional scalar-field cosmology resolves this tension. Introducing a fractional order $\u03b1\\neq 1$ generates non-local (memory) corrections in the Friedmann and Klein-Gordon dynamics that suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ essentially unchanged. We derive an explicit mapping $\u03b1(n,m)$ and recover the standard power-law limit as $\u03b1\\to 1$. For observationally favored values $\u03b1\\approx 0.8$-$0.9$ in four dimensions we obtain $n_s \\approx 0.965$ and $r \\lesssim 0.04$, bringing power-law inflation into agreement with data. The scalar potential follows self-consistently as an exponential, and a dynamical-systems analysis shows the fractional power-law solutions form stable inflationary attractors over the viable parameter range.

A variational autoencoder is trained on a simulated sample of energy measurements from incident high-energy electrons on a generic three-layer scintillator-based calorimeter. The encoding part is distilled into tabular format by regressing the latent space variables using decision trees, which is then programmed on a memristor-based ACAM. In real-time, the ACAM compresses 48 continuously valued incoming energies measured by the calorimeter sensors into the latent space, achieving a compression factor of 12x, which is transmitted off-detector for decompression. The performance result of the ACAM, obtained using the Structural Simulation Toolkit, the SST open source framework, gives a latency value of 24 ns and a throughput of 330M compressions per second, i.e., 3 ns between successive inputs, and an average energy consumption of 4.1 nJ per compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u5bfb\u5740\u5b58\u50a8\u5668\uff08ACAM\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5c0648\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u80fd\u91cf\u503c\u538b\u7f2912\u500d\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf24ns\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf330M\u538b\u7f29/\u79d2", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u91cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u5904\u7406\u529f\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5c42\u95ea\u70c1\u4f53\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u56de\u5f52\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u8868\u683c\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5230\u5fc6\u963b\u5668\u57faACAM\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u538b\u7f29", "result": "ACAM\u5b9e\u73b012\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf24ns\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf330M\u538b\u7f29/\u79d2\uff08\u6bcf3ns\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u6b21\u8f93\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u80174.1nJ/\u538b\u7f29", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eACAM\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u9ad8\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this work, we revisit curvature-squared string-inspired effective actions, from the point of view of appropriate local field redefinitions, leaving the perturbative string scattering matrices invariant. We require simultaneously unitarity and torsion interpretation of the field strength of the Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric tensor, features characterising the (3+1)-dimensional StRVM Cosmology. Unlike the higher dimensional case, the above feature is possible in the context of (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, obtained after string compactification. We demonstrate that the unitarity and torsion-interpretation requirements lead to a single-type of extra four-derivative terms in the effective gravitational action, not discussed in the previous literature of StRVM, which however is shown to be subleading by many orders of magnitude, compared to the terms of the StRVM framework. Hence, its presence has no practical implications for the relevant inflationary (and, hence, postinflationary) physics of the StRVM. This demonstrates the phenomenological completeness of the StRVM cosmological scenario, which is thus fully embeddable in the UV complete (quantum-gravity compatible) string theory framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u5f26\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u771f\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b(StRVM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728(3+1)\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u5e7a\u6b63\u6027\u548c\u6320\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u989d\u5916\u56db\u5bfc\u6570\u9879\u5bf9StRVM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f26\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u771f\u7a7a\u6a21\u578b(StRVM)\u5728(3+1)\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u5d4c\u5165UV\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5f26\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u573a\u91cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5fae\u6270\u5f26\u6563\u5c04\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8981\u6c42\u5e7a\u6b63\u6027\u548cKalb-Ramond\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f20\u91cf\u573a\u5f3a\u7684\u6320\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5206\u6790(3+1)\u7ef4\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5e73\u65b9\u5f26\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5e7a\u6b63\u6027\u548c\u6320\u7387\u89e3\u91ca\u8981\u6c42\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u79cd\u5148\u524d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u672a\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u989d\u5916\u56db\u5bfc\u6570\u9879\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u9879\u6bd4StRVM\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9879\u5c0f\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u66b4\u80c0\u548c\u540e\u66b4\u80c0\u7269\u7406\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "StRVM\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u5728\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5d4c\u5165UV\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u517c\u5bb9\u5f26\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u9879\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Saridakis"], "title": "Rotating Black Holes with Primary Scalar Hair: Shadow Signatures in Beyond Horndeski Gravity", "comment": "22 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables", "summary": "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87* provides a direct test of strong-field gravity, measuring an angular shadow diameter $\u03b8_d = 42 \\pm 3~\u03bc\\mathrm{as}$ and a circularity deviation $\u0394C \\leq 0.1$. Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion.

Khodahami", "Ahmad Sheykhi"], "title": "Entropy Modifications from Stochastic Metric Fluctuations", "comment": "15 pages, 1 table", "summary": "Deviations from the area law of the horizon entropy, in the cosmological setup, are known to lead to modified Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the universe. In this work, we propose that such modifications need not be introduced phenomenologically but can emerge dynamically from stochastic fluctuations of the spacetime metric. We consider a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe perturbed by a conformal, time-dependent noise factor, whose ensemble average vanishes, leaving the mean background geometry unchanged. By averaging the Einstein equations to second order in the fluctuation amplitude, we derive a modified Friedmann equation that includes an effective correction term. This correction is shown to be equivalent to the general expression obtained from an arbitrary deformation of the entropy-area relation. By specifying the statistical properties, particularly the variance of the conformal noise, we successfully reproduce the Friedmann equation corrections associated with several well-known generalized entropy frameworks, including R\u00e9nyi, (dual) Kaniadakis, Barrow, logarithmic, and MOND inspired hypergeometric entropies. Our results suggest that deviations from the area law can be interpreted as the macroscopic, coarse-grained imprint of unresolved, microscopic stochastic degrees of freedom in spacetime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6da8\u843d\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u4ea7\u751f\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u71b5-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\u53d8\u5f62\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u7684\u71b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u89c2\u968f\u673a\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u89c6\u754c\u71b5\u7684\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u662f\u552f\u8c61\u5f15\u5165\u7684\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fee\u6b63\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u65f6\u7a7a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6da8\u843d\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u71b5\u504f\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u89c2\u968f\u673a\u8d77\u6e90\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5171\u5f62\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u56e0\u5b50\u6270\u52a8\u7684FRW\u5b87\u5b99\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7cfb\u7efc\u5e73\u5747\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u5747\u80cc\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u65b9\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u9636\u6da8\u843d\u5e45\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u6709\u6548\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u71b5-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\u53d8\u5f62\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u5171\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u8457\u540d\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5305\u62ecR\u00e9nyi\u3001(\u5bf9\u5076)Kaniadakis\u3001Barrow\u3001\u5bf9\u6570\u548cMOND\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u8d85\u51e0\u4f55\u71b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u504f\u79bb\u9762\u79ef\u5f8b\u7684\u71b5\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u5fae\u89c2\u968f\u673a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5370\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5229\u7528\u7ebd\u66fc-\u5f6d\u7f57\u65af\u548cGeroch-Held-Penrose\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u538b\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7c7bSmarr\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9ed1\u6d1e\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5df2\u786e\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u8ff0\u4ecd\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89c6\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebd\u66fc-\u5f6d\u7f57\u65af(NP)\u548cGeroch-Held-Penrose(GHP)\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u754c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5c06\u89c6\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5f6d\u7f57\u65af-\u6797\u5fb7\u52d2\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u65cb\u8f6c\u538b\u529b\u7684\u538b\u529b\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "NP\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\u5c06\u89c6\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5f6d\u7f57\u65af-\u6797\u5fb7\u52d2\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u51fa\u7a33\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7c7bSmarr\u516c\u5f0f\u3002GHP\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u89c6\u754c\u5e73\u5747\u7269\u8d28\u538b\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u5171\u8f6d\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u6001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7c7bSmarr\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u51c6\u5c40\u57df\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u8ff0\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u89c6\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \\textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($\u03b9\\approx 76^{\\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \\approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}} \\approx 0.12$), the 99\\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\\ell_{\\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis.
