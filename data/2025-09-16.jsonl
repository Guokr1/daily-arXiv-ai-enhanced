Parallel\n(kappa_parallel) and perpendicular (kappa_perp) diffusion coefficients are\ncalculated using second-order quasi-linear theory (SOQLT) and unified nonlinear\ntransport (UNLT) theory, respectively. PSP's in situ measurements of magnetic\nturbulence spectra, including sub-Alfvenic solar wind, are decomposed into\nparallel and perpendicular wavenumber spectra via a composite two-component\nturbulence model. These spectra are then used to compute kappa_parallel and\nkappa_perp across energies ranging from sub-GeV to GeV. Our results reveal a\nstrong energy and radial distance dependence in kappa_parallel. While\nkappa_perp remains much smaller, it can increase in regions with relatively\nhigh turbulence levels delta B / B0. To validate our results, we estimate\nkappa_parallel using the upstream time-intensity profile of a solar energetic\nparticle event observed by PSP and compare it with theoretical values from\ndifferent diffusion models. Our results suggest that the SOQLT-calculated\nparallel diffusion generally shows better agreement with SEP intensity-derived\nestimates than the classic QLT model.

Here, we extend the practical\napplicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world\nfrequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld\ntwo-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark\nshift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation\nperformed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We\nsuccessfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response\nand reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be\nsimultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two\nneighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation.

Talk given at the 22nd Lomonosov Conference on\n  Elementary Particle Physics, 21-27 August 2025, Moscow, Russia", "summary": "In this manuscript, I discuss the possibility of sending a small probe to the\nclosest black hole with the goal of addressing some fundamental questions of\nmodern physics. Are astrophysical black holes the Kerr black holes predicted by\nGeneral Relativity? Do astrophysical black holes have an event horizon? Is the\nphysics around a black hole the same physics as in our laboratories on Earth?\nWhile we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be\navailable in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century\n(depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the\nprobe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and\naccurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime."}

As a result, accurate values of the STD in\ncomparison with first and second-order expressions for Schwarzschild spacetime\n(1Sch and 2Sch) and first-order post-Newtonian formalism (1PN) are achieved.\nAccordingly, the lowest STD discrepancies between our exact equation and these\napproximations lie within the picosecond and sub-picosecond level for light\nbeams affected by the Sun's gravity. Our results might be useful for time delay\nmeasurements in the solar system or extragalactic binary pulsar systems, where\na high accuracy level is required."}

We use a\nquantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined\n$F(R,\\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law\nsubspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the\n$F(R,\\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity\nsystem and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points.\nHowever, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the\ncombined $F(R,\\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated\nphenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off\nbelow a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary\nera, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term\nand the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian. The\nremaining system can successfully realize a power-law tail of the $R^2$\nslow-roll era."}

We use the Tolman metric and the\nEinstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source.\nWe show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity,\nreplacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during\ncontraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during\nexpansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts\nof matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon\nmay have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle\nlarger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy\ndominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore\noriginated from a black hole existing in another universe."}

Using the exact general\nrelativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both\nanalytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable\norbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive\nand repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive\ncase, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming\ncollective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We\ndemonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of\ntoroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We\ncompare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight\ngeneral relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable\ncircular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation\nbelt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in\nthe idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a\nphysically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to\navoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential."}

After filtering these sequences with respect\nto generous astrophysical constraints, we discover tight universal relations\nfor various bulk quantities of uniformly rotating neutron stars of arbitrary\nrotation rates. These universal relations allow to estimate, at very low\ncomputational cost, bulk quantities of rotating neutron stars employing mass,\nradius, and moment of inertia of associated non-rotating neutron stars. The\nrelations are calibrated to a large, model-agnostic dataset, thereby\neliminating a potential bias, and prove to be robust.

In particular, we investigate null\ngeodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding\nblack hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena\nin two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and\nthe strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach.

The CWT provides optimal time-frequency\ndecomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential\nfor compact binary coalescence identification.
