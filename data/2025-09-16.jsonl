Parallel\n(kappa_parallel) and perpendicular (kappa_perp) diffusion coefficients are\ncalculated using second-order quasi-linear theory (SOQLT) and unified nonlinear\ntransport (UNLT) theory, respectively. PSP's in situ measurements of magnetic\nturbulence spectra, including sub-Alfvenic solar wind, are decomposed into\nparallel and perpendicular wavenumber spectra via a composite two-component\nturbulence model. These spectra are then used to compute kappa_parallel and\nkappa_perp across energies ranging from sub-GeV to GeV. Our results reveal a\nstrong energy and radial distance dependence in kappa_parallel. While\nkappa_perp remains much smaller, it can increase in regions with relatively\nhigh turbulence levels delta B / B0. To validate our results, we estimate\nkappa_parallel using the upstream time-intensity profile of a solar energetic\nparticle event observed by PSP and compare it with theoretical values from\ndifferent diffusion models. Our results suggest that the SOQLT-calculated\nparallel diffusion generally shows better agreement with SEP intensity-derived\nestimates than the classic QLT model.

Here, we extend the practical\napplicability of Rydberg sensors by demonstrating the reception of real-world\nfrequency-modulated (FM) audio transmissions using a consumer-grade handheld\ntwo-way radio operating in the UHF band. Detection is based on the AC Stark\nshift induced by the radio signal in a Rydberg atomic vapor, with demodulation\nperformed using an offset local oscillator and lock-in amplification. We\nsuccessfully demodulate speech signals and evaluate the audio spectral response\nand reception range. We show that all consumer-accessible radio channels can be\nsimultaneously detected, and demonstrate simultaneous reception of two\nneighboring channels with at least 53 dB of isolation.

The\nreflectivity map, serving as a stable matching domain, is used in conjunction\nwith a training-free matching pipeline combining SuperPoint and MINIMA\nLightGlue. Geometry aware outlier rejection leverages both terrain elevation\nand its physically derived shadow map to further remove mismatches in\nacoustically occluded and topographically inconsistent regions, thereby\nimproving registration accuracy.

Are astrophysical black holes the Kerr black holes predicted by\nGeneral Relativity? Do astrophysical black holes have an event horizon? Is the\nphysics around a black hole the same physics as in our laboratories on Earth?\nWhile we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be\navailable in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century\n(depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the\nprobe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and\naccurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime."}

We use a\nquantitative approach by studying in detail the phase space of a combined\n$F(R,\\phi)$ cosmological system, focusing on the de Sitter and power-law\nsubspaces of the total phase space. As we show, the de Sitter subspace of the\n$F(R,\\phi)$ system shares the same fixed points as the vacuum $F(R)$ gravity\nsystem and the trajectories in the phase space tend to these fixed points.\nHowever, the power-law subspace is not stable and cannot be realized by the\ncombined $F(R,\\phi)$ system. To this end, we propose a well-motivated\nphenomenological $F(R)$ gravity model for which the $R^2$ term is switched off\nbelow a critical curvature near the end of the $R^2$ slow-roll inflationary\nera, and below that critical curvature, only the Einstein-Hilbert gravity term\nand the scalar field remain in the effective inflationary Lagrangian.
