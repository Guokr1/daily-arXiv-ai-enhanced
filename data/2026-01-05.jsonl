Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products."}

Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification."}

In particular, unintended electromagnetic radiation emitted by satellite electronics exhibits strong temporal variability and weak spectral regularity, limiting the effectiveness of conventional mitigation techniques that rely on long term averaging or multi epoch observations. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of low rank interference mitigation in the single epoch regime, where only a single time frequency snapshot is available. We formulate satellite induced interference as a structured but non stationary component superposed on astrophysical signals and thermal noise, and analyze the conditions under which low rank decomposition can successfully suppress interference while preserving underlying astronomical information. Through controlled simulations and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that aggressive rank truncation can lead to substantial signal distortion, particularly for diffuse or low signal to noise astrophysical features. We quantify this trade off using preservation and suppression metrics, and show that beyond a critical interference strength, low rank methods inevitably induce irreversible information loss. Our results clarify the operational boundaries of low rank approaches for next generation radio observations and highlight the need for interference aware, data driven mitigation strategies tailored to the single epoch regime."}

Moreover, the associated engineering challenges of assembling TEG modules must be overcome. Herein, we propose using super-insulating Resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) carbogels for scalable and sustainable TE applications through their electrical functionalization. Using a combination of a pyrolysis process and carbon fibers insertion, we achieved an increment by 12 orders of magnitude in electrical conductivity as well as ZT whilst retaining their intrinsic ultralow thermal conductivity (<50 mW/mK). A TE module in the form of a thermoelectric vacuum insulation panel (TVIP), was then fabricated using only a p-type material, to demonstrate a proof-of-concept self-powered WiFi-based vacuum-failure detection application in confined spaces in automobiles or aeronautics.

On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism."}

Solar Cruiser represents a critical step in the advancement of large-scale solar sail technology and includes the innovative use of an active mass translator (AMT) and reflectivity control devices (RCDs) as momentum management actuators. The coupled nature of these actuators has proven challenging in the development of a robust momentum management controller. Recent literature has explored the use of MPC for solar sail momentum management with promising results, although exact knowledge of the disturbance torques acting on the solar sail was required. This paper amends this issue through the use of a Kalman filter to provide real-time estimation of unmodeled disturbance torques. Furthermore, the dynamic model used in this paper incorporates key fidelity enhancements compared to prior work, including the Solar Cruiser's four-reaction-wheel assembly and the offset between its center of mass and center of pressure. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy successfully manages angular momentum growth under slew maneuvers that exceed the operational envelope of the current state-of-the-art method. The inclusion of the disturbance torque estimate is shown to greatly improve the reliability and performance of the proposed MPC approach. This work establishes a new benchmark for Solar Cruiser's momentum management capabilities and paves the way for MPC-based momentum management of other solar sails making use of an AMT and/or RCDs."}

Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order).\n  Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region."}

LoRA is an established technique for large language models that adds adapter networks to adjust model weights and biases to efficiently fine-tune large base models without retraining. We train a base model using a photometric redshift ground truth dataset, which contains broad galaxy types but is less accurate. We then fine-tune using LoRA on a spectroscopic redshift ground truth dataset. These redshifts are more accurate but limited to bright galaxies and take orders of magnitude more time to obtain, so are less available for large surveys. Ideally, the combination of the two datasets would yield more accurate models that generalize well. The LoRA model performs better than a traditional transfer learning method, with $\\sim2.5\\times$ less bias and $\\sim$2.2$\\times$ less scatter. Retraining the model on a combined dataset yields a model that generalizes better than LoRA but at a cost of greater computation time. Our work shows that LoRA is useful for fine-tuning regression models in astrophysics by providing a middle ground between full retraining and no retraining. LoRA shows potential in allowing us to leverage existing pretrained astrophysical models, especially for data sparse tasks."}

Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products."}

Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $ζ$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection."}

IXPE has observed about 100 sources, yielding meaningful polarimetry for most of them. An on-board calibration system mitigated most non-ideal detector behaviors during operations. Data from the on-board polarized and unpolarized X-ray sources are routinely ingested by the flight pipeline to correct the instrument response in a manner transparent to users. Based on its scientific return and payload health, the IXPE mission has been extended through 2028. The lessons learned are informing the design of next-generation X-ray polarimetry missions, as discussed elsewhere in these conferences."}

We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors."}

We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model."}

Here, we used a two-fluid approach to de Sitter thermodynamics and found a collective mode that is analogous to second sound in the two-fluid dynamics of the de Sitter state. This mode is massless and propagates at the speed of light. This suggests that this second-sound analog is a massless graviton propagating in de Sitter spacetime. The type of graviton this mode represents requires further consideration."}

We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\\rm c} - r_{\\rm h} \\to 0$, where $r_{\\rm c}$ and $r_{\\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the Pöschl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs."}

Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes."}

We apply the 3+1 decomposition to first-order cosmological perturbations to derive the cosmological dynamo equation under the kinematic-dynamo approximation. Our objective is to study the interaction between the seed magnetic field and the growing modes of scalar perturbations, whose associated velocity fields are evolved numerically using the software \\texttt{Einstein Toolkit} and \\texttt{FLRWSolver}. We find that these velocity fields effectively drive the amplification of the PMF, demonstrating that the extent of this growth is dependent on the electrical conductivity of the cosmic medium.
