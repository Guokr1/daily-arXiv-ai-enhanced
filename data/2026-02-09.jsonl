In addition to constructing experiments using radiopure materials and handling in underground laboratories, it is necessary to understand and reduce known backgrounds in data analysis. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless double beta Decay is searching for this decay using 76Ge-enriched high-purity germanium detectors submerged in an active liquid argon veto. A significant background in LEGEND is surface events from shallowly-impinging radiation on detector surfaces. In this paper we introduce the Collimated Alphas, Gammas, and Electrons (CAGE) scanning system, an internal-source scanning vacuum cryostat, designed to perform studies of surface events on sensitive surfaces of HPGe in a surface-lab. CAGE features a collimated radionuclide source inside a movable infrared shield that is able to perform precision scans of detector surfaces by utilizing three independent motor stages for source positioning. This allows detailed studies of pulse shapes as a function of source position and incident angle, where defining features can be extracted and exploited for removing surface backgrounds in data analysis in LEGEND. In this paper, we describe CAGE and demonstrate its performance with a commissioning run with 241Am. The commissioning run was completed with the source at normal incidence, and we estimate a beam spot precision of 3.1 mm, which includes positioning uncertainties and the beam-spot size. Using the 59.5 keV gamma population from 241Am, we show that low-energy photon events near the passivated surface feature risetimes that increase with radial distance from the detector center. We suggest a specific metric that can be used to discriminate low-energy gamma backgrounds in LEGEND with similar characteristics."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

Therefore, the neighbourhood of the GC black hole is a naive opportunity to test modified theories of gravity. In this work, effect of $f(R)$ gravity near the black hole is studied. The difference of pericentre shift between GR and $f(R)$ gravity is studied for compact orbits having semi-major axis equal to and below $a=1000$ au (S0-2 like orbits). In a model dependent approach, we choose $f(R) \\propto R^2$ (power law gravity) model which is cosmologically motivated and study the deviation in orbital pericentre shift for both zero spin and non-zero spin of the black hole. It is found that effect of $f(R)$ gravity becomes prominent for compact orbits. In model independent approach to $f(R)$ gravity with the generic scalaron fields ($ψ=f'(R)$), we extract the parameters of $f(R)$ gravity from the current bounds on Parametrised Post Newtonian (PPN) parameters ($γ, β$) near the GC black hole. The screening of $f(R)$ gravity is also investigated for these bounds on PPN parameters. It has been found that sufficiently massive scalarons ($10^{-16}$ eV) are completely screened but light and intermediate mass scalarons ($10^{-22}$ eV and $10^{-19}$ eV) are unscreened towards S0-2 like orbits as well as in the orbit of the newly discovered short period star S4716 ($a=407$ au). The possibility of detection of the $f(R)$ gravity effects due to these unscreened scalarons is forecasted with existing and upcoming astrometric capabilities of Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs)."}

A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

This results in entire optical/digital systems, which are traditionally designed sequentially, i.e. , the adaptive optics system is optimised first, and the restoration algorithms are designed a second time. Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera. In addition, we explore the potential of using multiple imaging channels operating at different wavelengths as a means of making an imaging system robust to turbulence strength and source magnitude variations. Later, any parameter of the optical/digital system, if not the entire system itself, could be optimized this way."}

Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified Pöschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals."}

We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with ξRφ^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of ξ), only when ξ\\le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For ξ> 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for ξ\\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed."}

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects."}

Lobo", "Taoufik Ouali"], "title": "Timelike Entanglement Entropy of Hawking Radiation", "comment": "10 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "We introduce the concept of timelike entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation as a novel probe of the black hole information paradox. By analytically continuing black hole spacetimes to Euclidean signature, we define timelike correlations that reveal a sequence of timelike Page times at which the entanglement entropy equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Applying this framework to Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, static higher-dimensional and braneworld solutions, four-dimensional Kerr, and higher-dimensional rotating Myers--Perry black holes, we demonstrate that timelike entanglement exhibits periodic or quasi-periodic behavior, with the recurrence times sensitive to surface gravity, charge, rotation, and spacetime dimensionality. Extremal and near-extremal black holes display effectively frozen thermal oscillations with persistent rotational modulation, reflecting their near-horizon geometries. Unlike conventional approaches based on islands or firewalls, our framework encodes information entirely in the Hawking radiation, preserving unitarity while avoiding violations of horizon smoothness. These results establish timelike entanglement as a robust and physically transparent mechanism for information recovery and provide a versatile tool for exploring quantum gravitational dynamics across a wide range of black hole spacetimes."}

This study proposes chaotic dynamics as a novel indicator for scalar hair in Horndeski gravity. We investigate the motion of a spinning test particle in a static, spherically symmetric hairy black hole spacetime. Our results show that increasing scalar hair systematically suppresses orbital chaos, as evidenced by regularized precession, reduced Lyapunov exponents, and contracted Poincare sections. Furthermore, scalar hair enhances the correlation between the two gravitational wave polarization modes, restoring phase coherence. These findings demonstrate that chaotic observables and gravitational wave signatures can jointly serve as sensitive probes for black hole hair, offering a complementary approach to testing gravity in strong-field regimes."}

In this paper, we present an analytic expression for the general $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian in the ADM gauge up to a single integral term that, to our knowledge, has no known closed-form analytic solution. We show that the integrals appearing in the 2PN Hamiltonian can be evaluated numerically to machine precision, allowing for cross-validation against analytical results and enabling the full numerical computation of the $N$-body 2PN Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the numerical integration of the equations of motion for $N$ bodies at 2PN order using different methods and discuss several strategies for improving computational efficiency."}
