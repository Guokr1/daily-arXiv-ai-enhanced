TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双层扭曲莫尔弹性系统作为可控平台，可在不同波系统中生成具有不同拓扑电荷的斯格明子家族成员，并展示了拓扑纹理的不连续传输和准周期结构中的相位子动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Skyrmion family members, such as skyrmions, bimerons, and skyrmioniums, have been recently observed in quantum, solid-state, water, and magnetic systems. However, it remains challenging and crucial to identify a single platform for observing their coexistence and evolution. Here, we describe a bilayer twisted moire elastic system as a controllable platform for the generation of skyrmion family members with distinct topological charges across different wave systems. Our experimental results further reveal that the twist angle induces a synergistic evolution between lattice symmetry and topological characteristics, enabling the mutual transformation and stable coexistence of different skyrmion family members within a single system. More importantly, we demonstrate that such a platform supports the discontinuous transport of Lamb-wave-induced topological textures, revealing phason-like dynamics within the quasiperiodic structure. This work opens a new avenue for designing all-in-one topological wave devices.

Conclusion: 扇形传感器集群方法能有效减少盲区，提高板结构损伤定位的准确性。

Abstract: Plate structures are widely used in large-scale engineering fields such as aerospace, hull manufacturing, and construction. However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can improve the accuracy of damage location.

*Tom Markvart*

Main category: physics.app-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索热电和光伏能量转换器之间的热力学相似性，澄清最大能量效率与卡诺效率的关系。

Method: 通过考虑塞贝克系数的温度变化，分析热电和光伏转换器的热力学行为，并应用有限时间热力学模型。

Result: 最大能量效率本质上低于卡诺效率，但可能存在更复杂的策略来回收这种损失。在有限电流下，进一步损失可通过有限时间热力学建模。

Conclusion: 热电和光伏能量转换器在热力学上具有相似性，其最大效率低于卡诺效率，但可通过先进策略改善性能。

Abstract: This paper shows a fundamental thermodynamic similarity between thermoelectric and photovoltaic energy converters which, at open circuit, can be represented as isochoric engines generating a finite chemical potential which appears as voltage at the terminals of the device. We show that, allowing for the temperature variation of the Seebeck coefficient, the maximum energy efficiency is intrinsically lower than the Carnot efficiency, as assumed in most of the literature, although more sophisticated strategies may exist to recuperate this loss. At finite current, further losses can be modelled in terms of finite-time thermodynamics.

### [4] [A Unified Analytic Framework for Microlensing Caustics: Geode Solutions and Hyper--Catalan Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15756)
*Gleb Berloff,Natalia G. Berloff*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出了一个制备不变的分析框架来描述微引力透镜焦散线附近的成像过程，通过局部魏尔斯特拉斯制备和超卡塔兰递推关系，实现了对多重像的高精度计算和连续性保持。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理微引力透镜焦散线附近的多重成像问题时存在精度和稳定性不足的问题，需要一种能够保证制备不变性并提供认证计算域的解析方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为光度测量和天体测量建模提供了具有元数据的单级数模板，能够有效量化稀疏性、刚性和安全评估域。

Abstract: We give a preparation-invariant analytic description of image formation near microlensing caustics. After a local Weierstrass preparation at any multiple image (order $d\ge2$), the lens mapping reduces to a single geode variable $m$ satisfying $m=U\,\varphi(m)$, where $U$ is a prepared source coordinate and $\varphi$ is an image-side kernel. The coefficients of $m(U)$ obey closed Hyper-Catalan (HC) recurrences, allowing termwise derivatives and truncation control from the characteristic system. We also use the same form for a short HC predictor-corrector: evaluate the series within its certified radius and apply a brief Newton polish near the boundary. We define an HC signature (first nonzero kernel coefficients) and an HC spectrum (branch points and analyticity radius $ρ_U$), which quantify sparsity, stiffness, and safe evaluation domains. The construction covers folds and cusps of any global degree. On a binary fold and cusp, an artificial decic with a resonant unit, and two triple-lens cusps of a challenging geometry, HC seeds plus a few Newton steps recover the exact images to machine precision within the certified domain and maintain continuity under continuation. The resulting single-series templates (with $(\mathrm{Sig}_R,ρ_U)$ metadata) are ready for photometric and astrometric modeling.

Abstract: The classification of radio galaxies is central to understanding galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei dynamics, and the large-scale structure of the universe. However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy.

Abstract: This paper optimizes the design and analysis of the mechanical test platform for the scientific probe module of the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph, which is the fifth part of the China Space Station survey Telescope. First, according to the module layout and economic requirements, the preliminary structural design of the module mechanical test platform is carried out, and the stiffness sensitive parameters of the assembly are identified to determine the optimization parameters. The Central Composite Design method is used to design the test platform, and a third-order regression model is constructed for response surface analysis. The third-order response surface model of the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the test platform is obtained by fitting the test data with the least squares method, and the structure of the module mechanical test platform is determined. The modal analysis is carried out to determine the fundamental frequency and vibration modes of the mechanical test platform. The vibration response of the platform is simulated by sine, random and swept frequency vibration simulations. The response surface fitting algorithm is verified by the test platform swept frequency test. The agreement between the response surface fitting algorithm and the experiment is good. The fundamental frequency of the test platform is 436.2Hz (>300Hz), which meets the design index requirements of the test platform and can accurately guide the optimization design work. At the same time, it provides the theoretical basis and design method for the structural design of the Chinese manned space station.

Abstract: The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) Balloon with Radio (PBR) is an instrument designed to be borne by a NASA suborbital Super Pressure Balloon (SPB), in a mission planned to last as long as 50 days. The PBR instrument consists of a 1.1 m aperture Schmidt telescope, similar to the POEMMA design, with two cameras in its hybrid focal surface: a Fluorescence Camera (FC) and a Cherenkov Camera (CC), both mounted on a frame that can be tilted to point from nadir up to 13 degrees above the horizon. The FC camera is designed to detect the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. The FC will be made of 4 Photo Detection Modules (PDMs), each consisting of a 6x6 matrix of 64-channel Multi Anode PhotoMulTipliers (MAPMT), for a grand total of 2304 pixels for each PDM. Custom-designed SPACIROC-3 ASICs perform single photoelectron counting on each pixel as well as charge integration on groups of 8 pixels to measure extremely bright or fast signals, reaching a double pulse resolution in the order of 10 ns for a 1 microsecond acquisition gate. A field flattener lens and a BG3 filter, to match the wavelength range of interest (300-400 nm), are mounted in front of the PDM. The camera will be able to detect showers in a field of view of 24x24 square degrees, with a pixel size on ground corresponding to 115 m. Details on the camera design and implementation will be given, along with the expected performance and the state of the construction.

### [9] [Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16256)
*Saptarshi Sarkar,Tirthankar Roy Choudhury*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于仿真器的框架，用于高效约束再电离纪元(EoR)，通过结合粗分辨率MCMC定位高似然区域和自适应采样策略，仅需约1000次高分辨率模拟即可训练出高精度神经网络仿真器，将计算成本降低约70倍。

Motivation: 传统参数推断方法在约束再电离纪元时计算成本过高，阻碍了基于物理动机模拟的研究进展。

Method: 结合粗分辨率MCMC定位高似然区域和自适应采样策略，构建紧凑的高分辨率训练集，训练基于人工神经网络的模型似然仿真器。

Result: 仅需约1000次高分辨率模拟，训练出的仿真器达到优异预测精度(R²≈0.97-0.99)，在MCMC框架中能复现完整高分辨率运行的后验分布，计算成本降低约70倍。

Conclusion: 该计算加速使得更高维模型的推断变得可行，为下一代EoR约束提供了通用的高效仿真器构建策略。

Abstract: Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of $\sim 100$ and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of $\sim 70$, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.

*Anne O'Connor,Harish Khandrika*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: WFC3/UVIS探测器的电荷转移效率随时间持续下降，低信号水平下降更快。下降速率更适合用二次或三次函数拟合，而非线性函数。残差分析显示存在约8-9年的周期性振荡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测WFC3/UVIS探测器电荷转移效率随时间的变化趋势，了解探测器性能退化情况，为科学数据校准提供依据。

Method: 使用扩展像素边缘响应技术分析2009-2025年的内部校准数据，采用线性、二次和三次函数拟合CTE下降趋势，并对残差进行Lomb-Scargle周期图分析。

Result: CTE持续下降，最低信号水平每年下降0.0001，总下降0.0015。二次函数拟合残差最小，三次函数拟合优度最佳。残差存在约8-9年的周期性振荡。

Conclusion: WFC3/UVIS探测器CTE呈非线性下降趋势，存在周期性变化特征，需采用更复杂的函数模型进行准确描述和预测。

Abstract: In this report, we examine the behavior of Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) on the WFC3/UVIS detector over time as computed by the Extended Pixel Edge Response (EPER) technique, using internal calibration data acquired from 2009 through 2025. We find that the CTE has continued to decline as expected, with a steeper loss rate for lower signal levels. The lowest signal level (160e-) has continued to decline at a rate of 0.0001 per year, with a total overall decline of 0.0015. Analyses from 2016 and 2020 found that the rate of decline was not well fit by a linear function. This report verifies the rate of decline is instead better fit by a quadratic function (which results in the smallest min. and max. residuals, on average) or a cubic function (which has the best "goodness of fit" $χ^2$ and $R^2$ values). We continue to see periodic oscillations of the residuals around all three fit lines (linear, quadratic, and cubic) on which we perform a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of the residuals. We find a periodicity of about 8 years for the residuals around the linear fit lines and about 9 years for the quadratic and cubic fit lines.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 分析WFC3/IR与Gaia DR3星表之间几何畸变线性项的相对偏移，评估WFC3仪器在2009-2024年期间的时间稳定性。发现2018-2021年间旋转项存在不确定性增加和偏移，与望远镜抖动增加时期一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估WFC3/IR几何畸变与Gaia DR3星表对齐的时间稳定性，为高精度天体测量提供参考。

Method: 使用MAST流水线的WFC3/IR到Gaia DR3对齐解决方案，分析16年期间的线性几何畸变项（旋转、倾斜、缩放、偏移）的时间演化。

Result: 2018-2021年间旋转项和倾斜项不确定性增加；旋转、倾斜、缩放偏移无显著线性时间演化；但偏移项显示时间演化，主要由望远镜指向不准确性引起。

Conclusion: WFC3/IR几何畸变解决方案在16年内保持稳定，但望远镜指向误差会影响天体测量精度。建议高精度天体测量用户使用tweakreg程序验证或改进图像对齐。

Abstract: We examine the relative offsets of the linear terms in the geometric distortion between WFC3/IR and the Gaia DR3 catalog using the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) pipeline WFC3/IR to Gaia DR3 alignment solutions to assess temporal stability over the lifetime of the WFC3 instrument (2009-2024). We find a period of increased uncertainty and offsets in the rotation term between 2018 and 2021, as seen in a previous analysis of WFC3/UVIS linear geometric distortion (O'Connor et al., 2024), corresponding with a period of increased jitter. We find a similar pattern of increased uncertainty between 2018 and 2021 in the skew offsets to Gaia DR3, as well. We find no significant linear temporal evolution in the rotation, skew, or scale offsets between the WFC3/IR IDCTAB distortion solution and Gaia DR3 over the 16-year lifetime of the WFC3 instrument; however, we do see temporal evolution in the shift offsets (the difference -in pixels- between the IDCTAB and Gaia WCS positions), which are dominated by telescope pointing inaccuracy external to the WFC3/IR geometric distortion solution. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we continue to recommend that observers verify or improve image alignment using the tweakreg routine.

TL;DR: 哈勃太空望远镜在单导星模式下仍能保持良好指向精度，500秒内曝光与双导星模式无差异，全轨道周期内漂移小于0.4像素，对大多数科学观测影响甚微


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估哈勃太空望远镜在仅使用单导星和单陀螺仪（RGM模式）时的指向性能，验证其是否仍能满足科学观测需求

Method: 分析历史GO观测数据和测试校准程序的图像，量化单导星RGM模式下的漂移情况，并与双导星模式进行对比

Result: 500秒内曝光PSF质量与双导星无差异；全轨道周期内漂移在4/5情况下小于0.2像素，1/5情况下约0.4像素；使用扰动PSF后处理可基本消除所有天体测量残差

Conclusion: 单导星RGM模式的漂移对大多数科学项目影响有限，PSF变化小于焦平面位置变化，可通过后处理有效校正

Abstract: HST is designed to use two guide stars (GSs) in the fine-guidance sensors (FGSs) to maintain its pointing and tracking during exposures. The primary GS holds the boresight fixed and the secondary GS keeps the orientation fixed. However, HST is also able to track using only a single GS by fixing the boresite on one star and maintaining the orientation using the available gyro(s). We evaluate the pointing quality achieved in this latter case, when one GS and one gyro (RGM, a.k.a., reduced gyro mode) are used. We find that in 1GS-RGM, there is indeed more drift during the course of an orbit than when two guide stars are used, but the drift is much smaller than was seen in previous times of sub-optimal gyro performance. We quantify the 1GS-RGM drift seen in recent archival GO data and in images from a test calibration program and find that (a) for exposures < 500 sec, the PSF quality in 1GS is indistinguishable from that of 2GS and (b) over the course of full orbits (~2500 sec), the drift in four of five cases was less than 0.2 pixel and ~0.4 pix in the other case. Such a drift is marginally detectable in observations, but it should have a marginal impact on most science programs, since the variation in the PSF caused by drift is smaller than the PSF variations with focus and with location on the detector. For observers who wish to correct drift effects, we show that the use of a perturbed PSF during post-acquisition data analysis removes essentially all astrometric residuals, even for drift levels up to ~0.5 pix, as well as most of the photometric residuals.

Abstract: In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the "I3T concept", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called "Butterfly's Eye" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.

Conclusion: 该自动化贝叶斯方法能够从下一代射电阵列的高质量数据中获得高保真偏振图像，相关管道已公开可用。

Abstract: Extracting polarimetric information from very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data is demanding but vital for understanding the synchrotron radiation process and the magnetic fields of celestial objects, such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). However, conventional CLEAN-based calibration and imaging methods provide suboptimal resolution without uncertainty estimation of calibration solutions, while requiring manual steering from an experienced user. We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays. The pipeline developed for this work is publicly available.

Conclusion: SCoRe4有潜力显著提高稀有事件物理实验中背景建模的准确性，为暗物质和中微子双贝塔衰变等实验提供更可靠的模拟工具。

Abstract: Surface simulations are important for accurately modeling particle interactions in experiments where background contributions from surface contaminants can significantly affect detector performance. In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics.

Abstract: The Nab (Neutron a b) experiment is designed to measure the beta-antineutrino angular correlation in free neutron $β$ decay with an ultimate precision goal of 0.1%, providing input for tests of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix unitarity. This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \pm 2) \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge. This impurity density profile was then used to characterize systematic effects in proton time-of-flight measurements due to detector pulse-shape effects; the resultant proton timing systematic uncertainties were below 0.3 ns, which is sufficient for the Nab experiment.

Abstract: Muon tomography is a non-destructive imaging technique that uses cosmic-ray muons to probe dense materials. A plastic scintillating fiber (SciFi) detector with a one-dimensional SiPM array offers a compact, high-resolution solution. However, scaling up the detector area and spatial resolution demands reducing the number of readout channels while maintaining detector performance. To address this challenge, this work presents a multiplexing scheme based on a diode-based symmetric charge division circuit combined with a position-encoding algorithm. Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons. Cosmic-ray measurements further demonstrate that the multiplexed SciFi detector achieves a detection efficiency above 95\% and a spatial resolution of about 0.65~mm, with only minor degradation compared to direct readout. These results verify that the proposed method offers a scalable and cost-effective readout solution for large-area muon tomography systems.

Abstract: Dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers are the core detector elements of many experiments that conduct searches for Dark Matter and rare events, as well as in neutrino and high-energy physics. As part of this detector technology, high-voltage electrodes are instrumental for the generation of observable signals and their physical interpretation. Thus, electrode design and manufacturing has to fulfill stringent requirements, and their production is associated with significant engineering challenges. In this work we describe the successful development of electrodes on the 1.5 m-scale, from their design and simulation to subsequent assembly and high-voltage testing in a gaseous argon environment. The produced electrodes were recently installed as an anode and a cathode during an upgrade to the XENONnT experiment.

Conclusion: 该模型为传统动力学暗能量模型提供了一个简单且解析可处理的替代方案，对解决哈勃张力问题具有潜在意义。

Abstract: We investigate a four-parameter entropic dark energy model in a spatially curved FLRW universe, based on a generalized entropy-area relation at the apparent horizon. While the proposed entropy function captures a broad class of gravitational entropy corrections, including Bekenstein-Hawking, Tsallis, and power-law forms, it does not encompass information-theoretic entropies such as Sharma-Mittal or Renyi. Within this framework, we derive exact analytical expressions for key cosmological observables, including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the dark energy density parameter $Ω_D(z)$, and the equation of state $w_D(z)$. A comprehensive parameter-space analysis reveals viable regions, particularly for $β> 1$ and small positive curvature, that accommodate elevated $H_0$ values consistent with recent SH0ES measurements. Our results offer a simple and analytically tractable alternative to conventional dynamical dark energy models, with potential relevance to the ongoing Hubble tension.

Result: 该理论不仅提供了新的暴胀机制和优雅退出，还解释了晚期宇宙的加速膨胀，并能与反常量子引力效应结合，产生可行的重子生成机制和对暗物质粒子质量与寿命的限制。

Conclusion: 该真空热力学方法为宇宙学提供了一个统一的框架，能够同时解释早期暴胀和晚期加速膨胀，并与其他量子效应相结合产生重要的宇宙学推论。

Abstract: The previously proposed modification of the standard (flat) inflationary $ΛCDM$ model in which the inflaton field(s) and ``dark energy" are replaced by the vacum in expanding Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker Universe is studied. The expanding joint vacuum of the all ingrediences of matter, including Standard Model particles and a dark matter sector, is treated as a thermal equilibrium state at temporal Gibbons-Hawking temperature, proportional to the Hubble parameter, and chemical potentials equal to particle masses. This theory provides not only the new mechanism of inflation and its graceful exit, but also explains acceleration of expansion for the late Universe. The formalism can be combined with the anomalous quantum gravity effects leading to a viable baryogenesis mechanism and certain bounds on dark matter particle masses and lifetimes.

Conclusion: 幂律近似存在局限性，扭转只能在受限条件下一致地驱动宇宙膨胀，二次黎曼-嘉当项的存在使方程复杂化，阻碍解析解的获得。

Abstract: We investigate torsion-driven cosmological dynamics within the framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity using the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formalism, where the tetrad and Lorentz connection act as independent variables and the Hamiltonian includes quadratic Riemann Cartan corrections. Embedding this theory in an FLRW background, we derive the corresponding torsion-modified Friedmann equations and analyze their solutions across radiation and matter-dominated epochs. The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=βt^α$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes. For $g_1\not=0$, the equations become nonlinear, precluding closed-form analytic solutions. These findings highlight the limitations of the power-law approximation and identify the restricted conditions under which torsion can coherently drive cosmic expansion.

Conclusion: 混合谱-PINN求解器为复杂设置中的准正则模谱提供了一条灵活且高精度的求解路径。

Abstract: We introduce SpectralPINN, a hybrid pseudo-spectral/physics-informed neural network (PINN) solver for Kerr quasinormal modes that targets the Teukolsky equation in both the separated (radial/angular) and joint two-dimensional formulations. The solver replaces standard neural activation functions with Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind and supports both soft -- via loss penalties -- and hard -- enforced by analytic masks -- implementations of Leaver's normalization. Benchmarking against Leaver's continued-fraction method shows cumulative (real+imaginary part) relative frequency errors of $\sim 0.001\%$ for the separated formulation with hard normalization, $\sim 0.1\%$ for both the soft separated and soft joint formulations, and $\sim 0.01\%$ for the hard joint case. Exploiting our ability to solve the joint equation, we add a small quadrupolar perturbation to the Teukolsky operator, effectively rendering the problem non-separable. The resulting perturbed quasinormal modes are compared against the expected precision of the Einstein Telescope, allowing us to constrain the magnitude of the perturbation. These proof-of-concept results demonstrate that hybrid spectral-PINN solvers can provide a flexible pathway to quasinormal spectra in settings where separability, asymptotics, or field content become more intricate and high accuracy is required.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the statistical mechanics within the polymer quantization framework in the semiclassical regime. We apply a non-canonical transformation to the phase space variables. Then, we use this non-canonical transformation to calculate the deformed density of states of the $2n$-dimensional phase space, which encompasses all polymer effects. In the next step, some thermodynamic features of a system of $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are studied by computing the deformed partition function. The results show that the number of microstates decreases because there is an upper bound on the momentum within the polymer framework. We found that in the high-temperature regime, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is close to the Planck length, $n$ degrees of freedom of the system are frozen in this setup. In other words, there is an effective reduction in space dimensions from $n$ to $\frac{n}{2}$ in the polymeric framework, which also signals the fractional dimension for odd-dimensional oscillators.

Conclusion: GUP修正的能量均分定律能避免宇宙初始奇点，为引力重子生成提供机制，且负GUP参数更符合观测约束。

Abstract: In this paper, combining the thermodynamical arguments of the horizon with the quadratic generalised uncertainty principle (GUP), we heuristically obtain the modified equipartition law of energy. Employing this modified equipartition law of energy, we derive the Friedmann equations in Verlinde's entropic gravity. We find a maximum energy density at the beginning of the Universe. Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears. We also compute the deceleration parameter. Finally, we revisit the gravitational baryogenesis and show that the GUP-modified equipartition law of energy provides a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry. Moreover, we constrain the GUP parameter from observations.

Abstract: Ten years ago, the first direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the merger of two black holes, GW150914, provided the very first opportunity to test Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR) in the extreme gravity regime, where the gravitational field is strong, characteristic speeds are highly relativistic, and spacetime is dynamical. Such a regime is currently accessible only through coalescing compact binaries. In this review, we summarize the status of testing GR with GW observations and discuss the lessons learned. We also touch upon the challenges we currently have in testing GR and the potential path forward to detect a credible violation of GR, should one exist in the data.

Abstract: Loop quantum gravity (LQG) attempts to unify general relativity with quantum physics to offer a complete description of the universe by quantising spacetime geometry, but the numerical calculations we encounter are extraordinarily difficult. Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.
  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of "loop removal". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.
  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes.

Abstract: This paper investigates scalar field perturbations coupled to the Einstein tensor of non-commutative black holes . We compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for different choices of the parameters using the partial wave method , and verify the latest correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes. The results show that larger values of the non-commutativity parameter $θ$ and the coupling constant $η$ introduced in this model lead to smaller absorption cross-sections. Furthermore, we find that this correspondence is accurate for non-commutative black holes in the limit of large angular momentum quantum number $l$.

Abstract: This work investigates neutrino propagation in the spacetime of a newly introduced black hole arising from spontaneous Lorentz-symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity. The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern.

TL;DR: 本文比较了标量场暴胀中的两种温度定义：真实气体温度TRG和相对论性粒子温度TRS，发现TRS在非最小耦合情况下更自洽，能将暴胀动力学与范德瓦尔斯等温线联系起来，并将暴胀开始与热力学相变相关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索标量场暴胀中不同温度定义的自洽性及其对暴胀势的影响，特别是在小场和大场势以及非最小耦合情况下的表现。

Method: 推导两种温度定义（TRG和TRS）的基本热力学关系，分析它们与Planck约束一致的暴胀势的关联，并研究非最小耦合场景下的表现。

Result: 发现TRS在暴胀期间递减，满足标准热力学定律，在Jordan和Einstein框架中表现框架无关性，且暴胀动力学可由范德瓦尔斯等温线描述。山顶势和小场势存在不一致性，而Starobinsky和α-attractor模型最适合。

Conclusion: TRS是更自洽的温度选择，暴胀开始与热力学相变相关，框架无关性仅在ζ≤1/6时实现，热力学考虑可为区分暴胀场景提供额外标准。

Abstract: We explore and compare two distinct temperature definitions for scalar field inflation in the context of small- and large-field potentials. The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $α$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $ζ\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文基于Herglotz变分原理提出了一种新的f(R,T)引力理论，将耗散效应纳入引力场方程，修正了牛顿引力势，并能解释宇宙加速膨胀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: f(R,T)引力中能量-动量张量的不守恒可解释为耗散的有效表现，这促使研究者探索基于Herglotz变分原理的新理论框架来处理耗散系统。

Method: 使用Herglotz变分原理扩展通常的哈密顿变分原理，允许拉格朗日量显式依赖于作用量，从而推导出包含Herglotz贡献的引力场方程。

Result: Herglotz修正导致牛顿极限下引力势的修改，与卡西尼号观测一致；在宇宙学模型中，Herglotz向量可扮演宇宙常数的角色；线性f(R,T)=R+αT模型在Herglotz方法下与观测相符。

Conclusion: Herglotz变分方法为f(R,T)引力提供了处理耗散系统的理论基础，能够解释观测现象并为宇宙加速膨胀提供替代机制。

Abstract: The non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in $f(R,T)$ gravity can be interpreted as an effective manifestation of dissipation. Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+αT$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.

Conclusion: 暖k-暴胀模型的非高斯性由内在和δN两个分量组成，通过与实验观测对比可以约束模型参数，为暴胀模型提供重要的观测检验。

Abstract: This paper presents and investigates non-Gaussian perturbations for the warm k-inflation model that is driven by pure kinetic energy. The two complementary components of the overall non-Gaussianity are the three-point and four-point correlations. The intrinsic non-Gaussian component, denoted as the nonlinear parameter f_{NL}^{int}, is rooted in the three-point correlation for the inflaton field. Meanwhile, the δN part non-Gaussianity, denoted as f_{NL}^{δN}, is the contribution attributed to the four-point correlation function of the inflaton field. In this paper, the above two components in warm k-inflation are individually computed and analyzed. Then, comparisons and discussions between them are conducted, and the non-Gaussian theoretical results are compared with experimental observations to determine the range of model parameters within the allowable range of observation.

Motivation: 改进1992年Pati的最大加速度分析，结合GUP预测的自然最小长度，探索量子引力效应在黑洞物理中的表现。

Method: 用广义不确定性原理(GUP)替代传统海森堡不确定性原理(HUP)，重新进行最大加速度分析，并将结果应用于史瓦西黑洞的引力加速度研究。

Result: 发现最大加速度a_max≈4c²/lₚ，且史瓦西黑洞在引力半径处的最大引力加速度不会变为无穷大，量子修正在史瓦西尺度而非普朗克尺度变得必要。

Conclusion: 量子物理本质通过GUP禁止真实奇点的存在，阻止史瓦西黑洞引力加速度变为无穷大，量子修正应在史瓦西尺度而非普朗克尺度进行。

Abstract: A maximun acceleration analysis by Pati dating back to 1992 is here improved by replacing the traditional Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) with the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), which predicts the existence of a minimum length in Nature. This new approach allows one to find a numerical value for the maximum acceleration existing in Nature for a physical particle that turns out to be a_{max}\simeq4\frac{c^{2}}{l_{P}}, that is, a function of two fundamental physical quantities such as the speed of light c and the Planck length l_{p}. An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite.

Motivation: 研究非可分离k-essence模型，通过动能项和势能项的耦合来修改暴胀观测量，使原本边缘化的单峰势能模型符合当前观测约束。

Method: 采用$X^ρV(φ)$耦合形式，势能相关前置因子$f(φ)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$，在慢滚近似下推导解析表达式，并与精确数值积分进行验证。

Result: 解析和数值预测在$n_s$上达到千分之一精度，$r$达到百分之一精度。当$\mathcal{K}<0$时，混合效应会系统性地降低$n_s$和$r$，使原本边缘化的单峰势能模型符合ACT+Planck+BAO观测约束。

Conclusion: 非可分离k-essence模型提供了一种有效机制来修改暴胀观测量，同时保持健康条件和当前非高斯性约束的兼容性。

Abstract: We investigate a non-separable subset of $k$-essence in which the kinetic and potential sectors interact through an $X^ρV(φ)$ coupling, implemented via a potential-dependent prefactor $f(φ)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$. In slow roll, this structure preserves a constant sound speed $c_s^2=1/(2ρ-1)$ while modifying the Hubble flow in a controlled way, thereby shifting the inflationary observables relative to the separable template. For monomial potentials $V=Aφ^n$ (with $n=2$ and $n=2/3$ as representative cases) we derive closed analytic expressions for $n_s(N_\ast)$ and $r(N_\ast)$ to $\mathcal{O}(ε_{\rm mix}^2)$, where $ε_{\rm mix}\propto\mathcal{K}$ encodes the non-separable $X^ρV$ mixing, and we validate them against exact background integrations. The analytic and numerical predictions agree at the sub-per-mille level for $n_s$ and at the percent level for $r$, confirming the accuracy of the small-mixing expansion. For $\mathcal{K}<0$ the mixing systematically lowers both $n_s$ and $r$ at fixed $N_\ast$, allowing otherwise marginal monomials to fall within the region favored by recent ACT+{\it Planck}+BAO constraints (P--ACT--LB). All solutions shown satisfy the health conditions $f(φ)>0$, $ρ>\tfrac12$, and the positivity bound $V<1/(2|\mathcal K|)$ (from $f>0$). We also discuss parameter dependence and the expected equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, which remains comfortably within current bounds for the benchmarks considered.

Result: 在(ℓ,m)=(1,1)和(2,2)扇区发现了极值极限附近的无限异常点序列，这些异常点介导了阻尼模式与零阻尼模式之间的转变。

Conclusion: 每个异常点携带几何相位，使得在整个泛音谱上实现绝热模式混合，这一现象被称为绝热遍历性。

Abstract: We uncover a cascade of exceptional points (EPs) in the quasinormal mode spectrum of massive scalar perturbations of Kerr black holes, revealing an intricate non-Hermitian structure underlying their linear response. The cascade originates from a single damped mode that enters the extremal spectrum for sufficiently large field masses. We obtain evidence for an infinite sequence of EPs in the $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$ sectors near the extremal limit, mediating the transition between damped and zero-damping modes. Each EP carries a geometric phase that enables adiabatic mode mixing across the entire overtone spectrum, a phenomenon we refer to as adiabatic ergodicity.

Abstract: Radiation exposure at aviation altitudes presents significant health risks to aircrews due to the cumulative effects of ionizing radiation. Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/rdp/, we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications.
