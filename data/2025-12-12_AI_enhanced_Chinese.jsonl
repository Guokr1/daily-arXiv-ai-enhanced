Achieving improved noise performance requires a physical understanding of the noise mechanisms. Here, we experimentally test a theoretical proposal for drain (output) noise as originating in part from real-space transfer (RST) by characterizing the microwave noise temperature of transfer-length method structures with the same channel composition but two different barrier compositions. This choice was made to alter the confining potential of electrons in the channel, thereby affecting the RST mechanism, while avoiding changes to the channel transport properties. We observe trends of noise temperature with physical temperature and source-drain voltage which are compatible with the predictions of RST noise theory. This finding supports the hypothesis that RST contributes to drain noise in HEMTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86InP HEMT\u4e2d\u6f0f\u6781\u566a\u58f0\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u5792\u7ed3\u6784\u7684TLM\u5668\u4ef6\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u566a\u58f0\u6e29\u5ea6\u968f\u7269\u7406\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6e90\u6f0f\u7535\u538b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u652f\u6301RST\u566a\u58f0\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "InP HEMT\u56e0\u5176\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5fae\u6ce2\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u7406\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u673a\u5236\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f0f\u6781\u566a\u58f0\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u8f93\u957f\u5ea6\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6c9f\u9053\u6210\u5206\u4f46\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u52bf\u5792\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5668\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u52bf\u5792\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u6c9f\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\u52bf\u5792\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6539\u53d8\u6c9f\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u6027\u3002\u6d4b\u91cf\u5fae\u6ce2\u566a\u58f0\u6e29\u5ea6\u968f\u7269\u7406\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6e90\u6f0f\u7535\u538b\u7684\u53d8\u5316", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u6e29\u5ea6\u968f\u7269\u7406\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u6e90\u6f0f\u7535\u538b\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u566a\u58f0\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u7b26\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9HEMT\u6f0f\u6781\u566a\u58f0\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u79fb\u662fInP HEMT\u4e2d\u6f0f\u6781\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3HEMT\u566a\u58f0\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u5668\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, the use of millimeter-wave frequencies raises public health concerns regarding prolonged electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure. Above 6 GHz, the incident power density (IPD) is used instead of the specific absorption rate (SAR) for exposure assessment, owing to the shallow penetration depth of millimeter waves. This paper proposes a hybrid field reconstruction framework that integrates classical electromagnetic algorithms with deep learning to evaluate the IPD of wireless communication devices operating at 30 GHz, thereby determining compliance with established RF exposure limits. An initial estimate of the electric field on the evaluation plane is obtained using a classical reconstruction algorithm, followed by refinement through a neural network model that learns the mapping between the initial and accurate values. A multi-antenna dataset, generated via full-wave simulation, is used for training and testing. The impacts of training strategy, initial-value algorithm, reconstruction distance, and measurement sampling density on model performance are analyzed. Results show that the proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, achieving an average relative error of 4.57% for electric field reconstruction and 2.97% for IPD estimation on the test dataset. Additionally, the effects of practical uncertainty factors, including probe misalignment, inter-probe coupling, and measurement noise, are quantitatively assessed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u7535\u78c1\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u91cd\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f3030GHz\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5165\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u5c04\u9891\u66b4\u9732\u9650\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u9891\u6bb5\uff083-300GHz\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u516c\u5171\u5065\u5eb7\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7535\u78c1\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u3002\u57286GHz\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u7a7f\u900f\u6df1\u5ea6\u6d45\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5165\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u6bd4\u5438\u6536\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u66b4\u9732\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u91cd\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u91cd\u6784\u7b97\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u9762\u7535\u573a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u6ce2\u4eff\u771f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7535\u573a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a4.57%\uff0c\u5165\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.97%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u63a2\u5934\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u63a2\u5934\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u91cd\u6784\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f3030GHz\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5165\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a5G\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u66b4\u9732\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This directional transition is a significant process that determines a CME's space weather effects but remains poorly understood. Based on multi-wavelength observations, we investigate the transition from non-radial to radial propagation in the low corona for two large-scale CMEs from the same active region on the solar limb. In the beginning, both CMEs move in a non-radial direction, beneath a system of overlying loops that are roughly parallel to the flux-rope axis. The CMEs laterally deform by bulging their upper flanks in the non-radial stage toward the higher corona, which results in the transition to a radial propagation direction approximately 25$^\\circ$ away from the eruption site. After the directional transition, the non-radial-stage upper flank becomes the leading edge in the radial stage. Although the overlying loops do not strap over the flux rope, their strong magnetic tension force constrains the radial expansion of part of the CME during the transition by acting on the flux-rope legs. A major portion of the filament is displaced to the southern part of a CME in the radial stage, which implies the complexity of observational CME features. This study presents the first investigation of the lateral deformation during the transition of CMEs from non-radial to radial in the low corona, and makes an essential contribution to the complete CME evolution picture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u65e5\u5195\u7269\u8d28\u629b\u5c04\uff08CME\uff09\u5728\u4f4e\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u4ece\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5411\u5f84\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u4fa7\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CME\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u7ffc\u81a8\u80c0\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5411\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0a\u5c42\u73af\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u5f20\u529b\u5bf9CME\u5f84\u5411\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591aCME\u6700\u521d\u4ee5\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u65b9\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5f84\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5411\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u51b3\u5b9aCME\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u5176\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aCME\u4ece\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u5230\u5f84\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6ce2\u957f\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u6d3b\u52a8\u533a\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21CME\u5728\u592a\u9633\u8fb9\u7f18\u7684\u4f4e\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u6d4bCME\u5728\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0a\u7ffc\u81a8\u80c0\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0a\u5c42\u73af\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u5bf9\u78c1\u7ef3\u817f\u90e8\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "CME\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u7ffc\u5411\u66f4\u9ad8\u65e5\u5195\u65b9\u5411\u81a8\u80c0\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fa7\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\u65b9\u5411\u8f6c\u53d8\u7ea625\u00b0\u3002\u8f6c\u53d8\u540e\uff0c\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0a\u7ffc\u6210\u4e3a\u5f84\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5148\u9a71\u8fb9\u7f18\u3002\u4e0a\u5c42\u73af\u7cfb\u7684\u5f3a\u78c1\u573a\u5f20\u529b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u78c1\u7ef3\u817f\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86CME\u90e8\u5206\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u81a8\u80c0\u3002\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u6697\u6761\u7269\u8d28\u5728\u5f84\u5411\u9636\u6bb5\u4f4d\u79fb\u5230CME\u5357\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9CME\u5728\u4f4e\u65e5\u5195\u4e2d\u4ece\u975e\u5f84\u5411\u5230\u5f84\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u4fa7\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CME\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u7ffc\u81a8\u80c0\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5411\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0a\u5c42\u73af\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u89e3CME\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

These jets depend on factors such as accretion rate, magnetic flux and the spin of the black hole. When such rotating black holes get attached to a cosmic string, it leads to a further rotational energy extraction, leading to a reduced spin. We consider such a system and investigate the effect this reduced spin has on the jet power and its dependence on the cosmic string tension, $\u03bc$. It is shown that for a constant magnetic flux and accretion rate, the jet energy flux is inversely proportional to $\u03bc^2$. Interestingly, the rate of this energy flux varies with time and is again dependent on $\u03bc$. We also study the total angular momentum evolution of the black hole by considering four major effects: accretion, jets, cosmic string energy extraction and the Bardeen-Petterson effect. Further, we attempt to analyse the condition for the spin-down of a black hole due to these effects and find out that it is possible for both small and large string tensions, with a higher possibility for larger string tensions. Another interesting phenomenon that has been proposed is the alignment of the jet with the cosmic string. Additionally, the Bardeen-Petterson effect also leads to alignment or misalignment of the inner and outer disks depending on the alignment of the string. In this manuscript we propose that these results might have an observable effect and hence could serve as a potential detection method for cosmic strings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u989d\u5916\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u79cd\u81ea\u65cb\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9Blandford-Znajek\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u03bc\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u5438\u79ef\u3001\u55b7\u6d41\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u548cBardeen-Petterson\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6052\u5b9a\u78c1\u901a\u91cf\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u03bc\u7684\u5e73\u65b9\u6210\u53cd\u6bd4\u3002\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u03bc\u3002\u9ed1\u6d1e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u81ea\u65cb\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u5c0f\u548c\u5927\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u8f83\u5927\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u55b7\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0cBardeen-Petterson\u6548\u5e94\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5916\u76d8\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u53ca\u55b7\u6d41\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u6d1e\u55b7\u6d41\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b87\u5b99\u5f26\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The target and multiple bright PSF references are within/close to the Roman Continuous Viewing Zone.

To investigate the effects of RDs on proton kinetics, we model a pair of switchback-boundary-like RDs with a hybrid Particle-In-Cell (PIC) approach in a 2D system. We find that, at one of the boundary RDs, a significant population of protons remains trapped over long times, creating a secondary beam-like component with temperature anisotropy $T_\\perp/T_\\|\\gtrsim4$ in the proton velocity distribution function that excites ion cyclotron waves within the downstream portion of the transition layer. Further analysis suggests that the static electric field in the vicinity of the RD is the key factor in trapping the protons. This work indicates that switchback boundaries could represent a viable environment for the creation of proton beams in the heliosphere; it also highlights the need to investigate RD sub-structures, especially the embedded current systems of interplanetary RDs.

While stressed by intense Lorentz forces, the existing HTS/LTS superconductors are prone to a reduction in critical current before reaching their structural mechanical limit. In this work, the magnetic and mechanical analysis of the FNAL 4-layer Bi-2212/Nb$_3$Sn hybrid dipole magnet is reported, aimed at predicting the critical current degradation for both the superconductors during powering at 16 T. All the Rutherford cables in the coils of the hybrid magnet were modeled at the strand level in Ansys APDL with the heterogeneous cable model. Utilizing this detailed geometry, it was possible to evaluate the effects of strain on the critical current degradation for both the Nb$_3$Sn and Bi-2212 superconductors under the intense Lorentz forces. The analysis presented in this paper integrates strain-dependent critical current laws, with parameters derived from experimental data, to simulate the hybrid magnet's performance for all possible current-powering configurations.

We assess the detectability of the events observed by current instruments up to the GWTC-4.0 data release, and of simulated populations consistent with the latest reconstruction by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that LGWA alone would have been able to observe more than one third of the events detected so far, and that it could detect $\\sim\\!90$ events merging in the ground-based band per year out to redshifts $z\\sim3-5$. Current detectors at design sensitivity and 100% duty cycle could detect thousands of BBHs per year, with one to a few hundred multiband counterparts in LGWA. Third-generation (3G) detectors can observe most of the BBHs detected by LGWA merging in their frequency band in the simulated mass range $7\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\lesssim M_{\\rm tot}\\lesssim 600\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, enabling systematic joint analyses of hundreds of events. The short time to merger from the deci-Hz band to the Hz-kHz band (typically months to a year) allows for early warning, targeted follow-up, and archival searches. Multiband observations of intermediate-mass BBHs in the deci-Hz band are particularly promising. We perform an injection study for a GW231123-like system (the most massive BBH detection to date, which accumulates $\\sim 10^5$ inspiral cycles in LGWA) and show that deci-Hz observations can measure the chirp mass even better than 3G instruments and yield good sky localization and inclination measurement, even with a single observatory.

However, the enabling technologies do not have flight heritage at the system level, and the concept remains immature to much of the community, meaning no direct-detection synthetic-aperture space-based interferometer has yet flown and an opportunity exists for the UK to take a world leading role. Here we propose the SPace-based InterFerometry Feasibility (SPIFF) Project as a program to address both issues simultaneously by: 1) completing a thorough survey of the science cases across the EM spectrum that would directly benefit from, or be impossible without, space-based interferometry; 2) down selecting key requirements via a Science Traceability Matrix mapping exercise; 3) host a workshop for the UK astronomical community to consolidate these findings; 4) build a technology demonstration mission to raise TRL and achieve flight heritage of critical technologies. Such a program positions the UK as the partner of choice for any future NASA or ESA space-based interferometry mission, allowing the UK to lead groundbreaking scientific discoveries, while also directly benefiting the UK industrial base by advancing domestic exportable technologies and building direct synergy with other UK space priorities. Indeed, the UK is uniquely positioned to lead in space-based interferometry, possessing a rare trifecta of domestic strengths: world-class expertise in ground-based interferometry and space-based instrumentation; commercial entities developing mission-critical technologies; and scientists whose research spans the full range of science cases that would benefit directly from space-based interferometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPIFF\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u79d1\u5b66\u6848\u4f8b\u8c03\u7814\u3001\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u793e\u533a\u5efa\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u82f1\u56fd\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765NASA/ESA\u4efb\u52a1\u505a\u51c6\u5907\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5355\u5b54\u5f84\u7a7a\u95f4\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u6210\u4e3a\u5fc5\u7136\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u98de\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u793e\u533a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e16\u754c\u9886\u5148\u5730\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "1) \u5168\u9762\u8c03\u7814\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u79d1\u5b66\u8ffd\u6eaf\u77e9\u9635\u7b5b\u9009\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\uff1b3) \u4e3e\u529e\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u51dd\u805a\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b4) \u5efa\u8bbe\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u5347\u6280\u672f\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u4f7f\u82f1\u56fd\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765NASA\u6216ESA\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9996\u9009\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u82f1\u56fd\u5de5\u4e1a\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u7684\u534f\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u82f1\u56fd\u51ed\u501f\u5730\u9762\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4eea\u5668\u6280\u672f\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5904\u4e8e\u9886\u5bfc\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e72\u6d89\u6d4b\u91cf\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7edd\u4f73\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0cSPIFF\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Previous missions, including Mariner, Venera, and the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (PVO), reported a recurring localized increase in electron density, often termed a \"bulge,\" at altitudes between 160 and 200 km. This study investigates this topside bulge using over 200 dayside electron density profiles derived from the Venus Radio Science experiment (VeRa) onboard the Venus Express (VEX). We employ an automated, gradient-based classification algorithm to provide a quantitative and reproducible method for identifying and categorizing the bulge morphology into three types. Type 1 profiles exhibit a distinct secondary peak above the main V2 layer. Type 2 profiles display a shoulder-like feature near the bulge altitude. Type 3 bulges are not visually apparent but can be identified through residuals obtained after subtracting a Chapman layer fit to the V2 peak. The bulge is detected in over 80\\% of the analyzed profiles, with a higher occurrence during periods of low solar activity and at lower solar zenith angles (SZA). Type 1 morphologies are only observed at low latitudes (within $\\pm 40^\\circ$). The peak altitude of the bulge negatively correlates with SZA, suggesting that thermospheric cooling toward the terminator significantly influences the bulge altitude. The occurrence patterns and morphological characteristics indicate that the bulge is likely influenced by external drivers, such as solar wind interaction, rather than being solely a result of local photochemical processes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u661f\u5feb\u8f66VeRa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u91d1\u661f\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u9876\u90e8\u51f8\u8d77\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b080%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5256\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u51f8\u8d77\uff0c\u5176\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u3001\u592a\u9633\u5929\u9876\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5916\u90e8\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u9a71\u52a8\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u661f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56fa\u6709\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u5176\u7535\u79bb\u5c42\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230160-200\u516c\u91cc\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\"\u51f8\u8d77\"\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u91d1\u661f\u5feb\u8f66VeRa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u9876\u90e8\u51f8\u8d77\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91d1\u661f\u5feb\u8f66VeRa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u53d6\u7684200\u591a\u4e2a\u65e5\u4fa7\u7535\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5256\u9762\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u51f8\u8d77\u5f62\u6001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1aType 1\uff08\u4e3bV2\u5c42\u4e0a\u65b9\u660e\u663e\u6b21\u5cf0\uff09\u3001Type 2\uff08\u51f8\u8d77\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9644\u8fd1\u80a9\u72b6\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u3001Type 3\uff08\u901a\u8fc7Chapman\u5c42\u62df\u5408\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u8fc780%\u5256\u9762\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u51f8\u8d77\uff0c\u4f4e\u592a\u9633\u6d3b\u52a8\u671f\u548c\u4f4e\u592a\u9633\u5929\u9876\u89d2\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002Type 1\u4ec5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4f4e\u7eac\u5ea6\uff08\u00b140\u00b0\u5185\uff09\u3002\u51f8\u8d77\u5cf0\u503c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0e\u592a\u9633\u5929\u9876\u89d2\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u70ed\u5c42\u51b7\u5374\u5411\u6668\u660f\u7ebf\u65b9\u5411\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u51f8\u8d77\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51f8\u8d77\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u65e0\u78c1\u573a\u884c\u661f\u7535\u79bb\u5c42-\u592a\u9633\u98ce\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The PICOSEC Micromegas (or PICOSEC-MM) detector, developed by the CERN-based PICOSEC collaboration, use the Micromegas structure for gaseous amplification and achieve below 20 ps timing resolution. A new type of PICOSEC detector, the \u03bcRWELL-PICOSEC based on \u03bcRWELL amplification structure, is being investigated at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) alongside PICOSEC-MM R&D efforts in Europe.

However, a general-relativistic description of the dark matter phase-space distribution is currently available only for the case of a dark matter \"spike\" arising from adiabatic black hole growth. Here we develop a fully general-relativistic formalism for the more realistic scenario in which a supermassive stellar progenitor collapses to a black hole and produces a shallower dark matter overdensity, or \"mound\". We follow self-consistently the evolution of the supermassive star, its collapse, and the subsequent growth of the resulting black hole, together with the collisionless dark matter orbits. We find that in the regime where the collapse becomes non-adiabatic, the dark matter distribution function is significantly reshaped, with a clear depletion in the low-binding-energy region of phase space. Our results provide a more realistic prediction for the dark matter phase-space distribution around supermassive black holes, which is an essential step in our programme to use future EMRI observations to extract information about both the nature of dark matter and the formation history of the black hole.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u574d\u7f29\u5f62\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\"\u571f\u58a9\"\uff08\u800c\u975e\"\u5c16\u5cf0\"\uff09\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765EMRI\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u53d6\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7edd\u70ed\u589e\u957f\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\"\u5c16\u5cf0\"\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u574d\u7f29\u5f62\u6210\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u8f83\u6d45\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\"\u571f\u58a9\"\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u5168\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u5168\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u81ea\u6d3d\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u574d\u7f29\u3001\u9ed1\u6d1e\u540e\u7eed\u589e\u957f\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u8f68\u9053\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u574d\u7f29\u53d8\u4e3a\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u574d\u7f29\u53d8\u4e3a\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u51fd\u6570\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u5851\uff0c\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4e\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u533a\u57df\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u8017\u5c3d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u65cb\u8fdb\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

The MorphZ estimator requires only posterior samples together with the prior and likelihood, and is fully agnostic to the choice of sampler. We evaluate MorphZ's performance across statistical benchmarks, pulsar timing array (PTA) models, compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave (GW) simulations and the GW150914 event. Across these applications, spanning low to high dimensionalities, MorphZ yields accurate evidence at substantially reduced computational cost relative to standard approaches, and can improve these estimates even when posterior coverage is incomplete. Its bridge sampling relative error diagnostic provides conservative uncertainty estimates.

Recently, low-cost sensors based on micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technology are also becoming more widely adopted. However, their measurement accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature. In this study, we developed an environmental testing system integrated with a triaxial vibration exciter. The system can reproduce long-stroke, low-frequency triaxial vibrations -- such as those caused by huge earthquakes -- under temperatures ranging from $-30~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ to $+80~^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Using this system, the measurement accuracy of vibration sensors can be evaluated under different environmental conditions. The system provides highly accurate reference measurements using a laser interferometer and reference accelerometers that are primarily calibrated within the system.

We find that the minimum required mass varies significantly for different Ans\u00e4tze. We also consider the effect of including a mass term for the scalar field.

However, these methods are sensitive to noise and unsuitable for ultra-low-resolution data. Given that the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will acquire large volumes of ultra-low-resolution spectra, developing effective methods for ultra-low-resolution spectral analysis is crucial. In this work, we investigated the Fully Connected Residual Network (FCResNet) for simultaneously estimating atmospheric parameters ($T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H]) and elemental abundances ([C/Fe], [N/Fe], [Mg/Fe]). We trained and evaluated FCResNet using CSST-like spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 200) generated by degrading LAMOST spectra (\\textit{R} $\\sim$ 1,800), with reference labels from APOGEE. FCResNet significantly outperforms traditional machine learning methods (KNN, XGBoost, SVR) and CNN in prediction precision. For spectra with g-band signal-to-noise ratio greater than 20, FCResNet achieves precisions of 78 K, 0.15 dex, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, 0.10 dex, and 0.05 dex for $T_\\text{eff}$, $\\log g$, [Fe/H], [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Mg/Fe], respectively, on the test set. FCResNet processes one million spectra in only 42 seconds while maintaining a simple architecture with just 348 KB model size.

These solutions are termed ``frozen solitonic Hayward-boson stars\" (FSHBSs). Continuously decreasing $\u039b$ disrupts the frozen state. However, we did not find a frozen solution when $q<q_c$. The value of $q_c$ depends both on the cosmological constant $\u039b$ and the self-interaction coupling $\u03b7$. We also found that for high frequency solutions, increasing $\u03b7$ can yield a pure Hayward solution. However, for low frequency solutions, increasing $\u03b7$ reduces both $1/g_{rr}$ and $-g_{tt}$.

NUTEx is an imaging telescope operating in the 200-300 nm wavelength range, intended for deployment on a micro-satellite bus. The optical system is based on a Ritchey Chretien (RC) telescope configuration, featuring a 146 mm primary mirror. The detector is a photon-counting microchannel plate (MCP) device with a solar-blind photocathode, paired with an in-house developed readout unit. The instrument has a wide field of view (FoV) of 4 deg, a peak effective area of approximately 18 sq cm at 260 nm, and can reach a sensitivity of 21 AB magnitude (SNR = 5) in a 200 second exposure. The primary scientific objective of NUTEx is to monitor the night sky for transient phenomena, such as supernova remnants, flaring M-dwarf stars, and other short-timescale events.

If the dominant energy condition is satisfied for null vectors, it follows that an extension of the near-horizon geometry admits an enhanced isometry group containing $SO(2,1)$ or the 2D Poincar\u00e9 group $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\rtimes SO(1,1)$.

Although originally conceived for the analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) light curves (LCs), MEPSA can be readily applied to other transient phenomena. The algorithm scans the input data by applying a set of 39 predefined patterns across multiple timescales. While robust and effective, its computational cost becomes significant at large re-binning factors. To address this, FAST-MEPSA introduces a sparser offset-scanning strategy. In parallel, building on MEPSA's flexibility, we introduce a 40th pattern specifically designed to recover a class of elusive peaks that are typically sub-threshold and lie on the rising edge of broader structures - often missed by the original pattern set. Both versions of FAST-MEPSA - with 39 and 40 patterns - were validated on simulated GRB LCs. Compared to MEPSA, the new implementation achieves a speed-up of nearly a factor 400 at high re-binning factors, with only a minor (~4%) reduction in the number of detected peaks. It retains the same detection efficiency while significantly lowering the false positive rate of low significance. The inclusion of the new pattern increases the recovery of previously undetected and sub-threshold peaks. These improvements make FAST-MEPSA an effective tool for large-scale analyses where a robust trade-off between speed, efficiency, and reliability is essential. The adoption of 40 patterns instead of the classical 39 is advisable when an enhanced efficiency in detecting faint events is desired.

Jow", "Ue-Li Pen"], "title": "Reaching diffraction-limited localization with coherent PTAs", "comment": "8 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Current pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses do not take full advantage of pulsar distance information, thereby missing out on improved angular resolution and on a potential factor-of-two gain in detection sensitivity for individual gravitational-wave (GW) sources. In this work, we investigate the impact of precise pulsar distance measurements on angular resolution as an extension to previous work measuring the angular resolution of a dense, isotropic PTA [Jow et al., 2025]. We present a coherent map-making technique that utilizes precise pulsar distance measurements to reach the diffraction-limited resolution of an individual source: $\u03b4\u03b8_{\\mathrm{diff}} \\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})(\u03bb_{\\mathrm{GW}}/r) \\approx 2~\\mathrm{arcmin}$, where the SNR refers to the detection strength of the source. With this level of angular resolution, identifying an EM counterpart may become feasible, enabling multi-messenger follow-up. We show that for $\\rm SNR=10$, which may be the current sensitivity level using a coherent analysis, the diffraction limit is reached with roughly 9 pulsars. Moreover, angular resolution scales sharply with the number of known pulsar distances as $\\sim (1/\\mathrm{SNR})^{N_{\\mathrm{dist}}/2}$. Thus, each additional pulsar with high signal-to-noise timing and precise distance measurement can improve PTA resolution by an order of magnitude. The distance to the best-timed millisecond pulsar (PSR J0437$-$4715) is already constrained to sub-parsec levels.

In general relativity, both stationary black holes and stationary stellar configurations are known to be axisymmetric, and black hole rigidity has been extended to several higher curvature modifications of gravity. In contrast, no comparable result had previously been established for stationary stars beyond general relativity. In this work we extend the stellar axisymmetry theorem to a broad class of diffeomorphism invariant metric theories. Assuming asymptotic flatness and standard smoothness requirements, we show that the Killing symmetry implied by thermodynamic equilibrium inside the star uniquely extends to the exterior region, thereby enforcing rotational invariance. This demonstrates that axisymmetry of stationary stellar configurations is not a feature peculiar to Einstein gravity but a universal property of generally covariant gravitational theories, persisting even in the presence of higher curvature corrections.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6052\u661f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b9a\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u4e0d\u53d8\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u534f\u53d8\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u8d28", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u9759\u6b62\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u6052\u661f\u914d\u7f6e\u5df2\u77e5\u662f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u521a\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\u5df2\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u9636\u66f2\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9759\u6b62\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u5c1a\u65e0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7279\u6709\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6052\u661f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b9a\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u4e0d\u53d8\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6e10\u8fd1\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u5e73\u8861\u6240\u8574\u542b\u7684Killing\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u552f\u4e00\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f3a\u5236\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9759\u6b62\u6052\u661f\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u534f\u53d8\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u66f2\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002\u6052\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7684Killing\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u552f\u4e00\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5916\u90e8\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7279\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5e7f\u4e49\u534f\u53d8\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u6052\u661f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u5b9a\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u4e0d\u53d8\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u9636\u66f2\u7387\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u6210\u7acb\u3002"}}

Here, we develop a method to search for ultra-compact binaries with chirp masses ranging from $[10^{-2},10^{-1}]M_\\odot$. This mass range represents a previously unexplored gap in gravitational-wave searches for compact binaries: it was thought that the signals would too long for matched-filtering analyses but too short for time-frequency pattern-recognition techniques. Despite this, we show that a pattern-recognition technique, the Generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), can be employed with particular modifications that allow us to handle rapidly spinning-up binaries and to increase the statistical robustness of our method, and call this improved method BinaryGFH-v2. We then design a hypothetical search for binaries in this mass regime, compare the empirical and theoretical sensitivities of this method, and project constraints on formation rate densities and the fraction of dark matter that primordial black holes could compose in both current- and future-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

We find that the backreaction of the instability causes the star to become more gravitationally bound, accelerating the growth, and eventually leading to black hole formation.

The current Universe's accelerated expansion is driven by a cosmological constant while the impact of the nonminimal coupling on the expansion history is recast as an effective equation of state for evolving dark energy. The model is analyzed under a tracking solution that follows the minimum of the effective potential for a scalar field that captures the modified theory's effects. We determine the conditions for the existence of this minimum and for the validity of the tracking solution. Cosmological constraints on the parameters of the model are obtained by resorting to recent outcomes of data from the DESI collaboration in combination with the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey supernovae compilations, which give compatible results that point to the presence of a dynamical behavior for dark energy. The gravity model violates the equivalence principle since it gives rise to a fifth force that implies the Earth and Moon fall differently towards the Sun. The cosmological constraints are intersected with limits resulting from a test of the equivalence principle in the Earth-Moon system based on lunar laser ranging data. We find that a variety of model parameters are consistent with both of these constraints, all while producing a dynamical evolution of dark energy with similarities to that found in recent DESI results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DESI\u7b49\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u9a8c\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u7684\u8fdd\u53cd", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8ffd\u8e2a\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ddf\u968f\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408DESI\u3001Pantheon+\u548cDES\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6708\u7403\u6fc0\u5149\u6d4b\u8ddd\u68c0\u9a8c\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u8fdd\u53cd", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u8fd1\u671fDESI\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5730\u7403-\u6708\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u8303\u56f4", "conclusion": "\u975e\u6700\u5c0f\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5176\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7b49\u6548\u539f\u7406\u68c0\u9a8c\u76f8\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6846\u67b6"}}

The detection of any other subdominant stochastic GW background (GWB), especially a primordial GWB, will be disturbed by the astrophysical foreground, which needs to be cleaned for further studies of other stochastic GWB. Although previous studies have proposed several cleaning methods, the foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNS) has been a major obstacle to remove. In this paper, we propose the novel idea to acquire better estimation of the unresolved foreground, by using the information about its anisotropies. We simulate the BNS population and compute its angular power spectrum and shot noise. We find that the shot noise from BNS is too faint to observe after subtracting loud signals due to the limited angular resolution of the third-generation detectors. This justifies the approximation regarding the unresolved foreground as an isotropic component. We also discuss the angular resolution necessary to make our method valid for the foreground subtraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u539f\u521d\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u81f4\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u524d\u666f\u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u4e3b\u5bfc\u603b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u5176\u4ed6\u4e9a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u539f\u521d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\uff09\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6e05\u7406\u524d\u666f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u6e05\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4e9a\u9608\u503c\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4ecd\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u89d2\u529f\u7387\u8c31\u548c\u6563\u7c92\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u7684\u6563\u7c92\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u51cf\u53bb\u54cd\u4eae\u4fe1\u53f7\u540e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5fae\u5f31\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u524d\u666f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4f7f\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u524d\u666f\u51cf\u9664\u6240\u9700\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e09\u4ee3\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6e05\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u7684\u89d2\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

In these studies, the adoption of a Hamiltonian formulation offers an insightful perspective. The aim of this work is twofold. First, we revisit and elaborate the results obtained so far in Kantowski-Sachs, with the focus placed on axial perturbations. In particular, by exploiting the relation between this spacetime and the interior of a nonrotating BH, we consider the extension of those results to the exterior geometry of the BH. In this way, we clarify the relation between the axial perturbative gauge invariants emerging from the canonical analysis and the already well-established axial BH invariants, often referred to as master functions. We do so by providing a unified picture of the Hamiltonian formalism, which does not distinguish, formally, between exterior and interior geometries. The second objective is to explore the role of Darboux transformations, which were found as hidden symmetries in the context of BH perturbations, and their appearance in the Hamiltonian setting. Within this framework, the Hamiltonian formulation provides a clear geometric interpretation and characterization of Darboux transformations within the axial sector, viewing them as the set of canonical transformations between Hamiltonians for axial master functions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8f74\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e3a\u5206\u6790Schwarzschild\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5206\u6790\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\uff0c\u5229\u7528Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0e\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5916\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5916\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f74\u5411\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5206\u6790\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Darboux\u53d8\u6362\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8f74\u5411\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8d4b\u4e88\u5176\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86Kantowski-Sachs\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u8f74\u5411\u6270\u52a8\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aDarboux\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Starting from the Kantowski-Sachs geometry, one can instead construct a perturbative Hamiltonian description for the interior region of an uncharged and nonrotating black hole. This approach provides a complementary perspective and enables a quantum treatment of the background geometry and its perturbations. In this work, we extend the application of this formulation to the exterior region and establish a correspondence between the perturbative invariants of the canonical approach and the master functions commonly used in black hole analyses.

As radio telescope sensitivity improves, PTAs are also expected to detect continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries. Nanohertz GWs generate both Earth and pulsar terms in the timing data, and the time delay between the two terms encodes the pulsar distance. Precise pulsar distance measurements are critical to fully exploiting pulsar-term information, which can improve the measurement precision of GW sources' sky position parameters and thus enhance the GW sky-localization capability. In this work, we propose a new pulsar distance estimation method by using pulsar-term phase information from GWs. We construct two-dimensional distance posteriors for pulsar pairs based on the simulated GW signals and combine them to constrain individual pulsar distances. Compared with the existing one-dimensional method, our approach reduces the impact of source-parameter uncertainties on pulsar distance measurements. Considering four GW sources and a PTA of 20 pulsars with a white-noise level of 20 ns, we find that a significant fraction of pulsars at distances $\\lesssim 1.4$ kpc can achieve sub-parsec distance precision over a 15-year observation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u9879\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u6d4b\u91cf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5bf9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ba1\u65f6\u9635\u5217\uff08PTAs\uff09\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u7eb3\u8d6b\u5179\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u80cc\u666f\u5e76\u6709\u671b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5355\u4e2a\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u9879\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u5929\u7a7a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u9879\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5bf9\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8ddd\u79bb\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u5355\u4e2a\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8003\u86514\u4e2a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u548c\u5305\u542b20\u9897\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u7684PTA\uff08\u767d\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e7320\u7eb3\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u22721.4 kpc\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\uff0c\u572815\u5e74\u89c2\u6d4b\u671f\u5185\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e9a\u79d2\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u9879\u76f8\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u7684\u5929\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765PTA\u89c2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We show that this conclusion can change when the central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter environment. We compute, for the first time, the relativistic dynamical-friction force on a neutron star moving through a collisionless medium and its impact on the evolution of EMRIs embedded in dense dark matter spikes. We then perform a Bayesian parameter-estimation analysis of simulated LISA observations to assess the measurability of both spike properties and the companion's internal structure. We find that, in our fiducial dark matter spike models, EMRIs with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\\gtrsim 20$ already allow us to distinguish neutron star from black hole companions, while events with SNR $\\gtrsim 400$ make it possible to discriminate between different neutron star equations of state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u65cb\u8fd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5c16\u5cf0\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4f34\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u771f\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u65cb\u8fd1\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4f34\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u4e00\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u6b21\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u5728\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6469\u64e6\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5c16\u5cf0\u4e2dEMRI\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u62dfLISA\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5c16\u5cf0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u226520\u5373\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f34\u661f\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u2265400\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u72b6\u6001\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u73af\u5883\u4f7fEMRI\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4f34\u661f\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u5bc6\u5929\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5206\u5e03\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7a97\u53e3\uff0cLISA\u89c2\u6d4b\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u91cd\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002"}}
