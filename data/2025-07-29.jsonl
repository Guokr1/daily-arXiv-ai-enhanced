In this work, we\nderive general performance bounds for thermoradiative heat engines that\nexchange heat radiatively with a cold sink, establishing\npower-versus-efficiency thermodynamic bounds for several configurations. We\nfind that the performance of these engines is always bounded by that of\nradiative engines, which harness the thermal radiation emitted by a hot source,\nmaking thermoradiative engines inherently less favorable for energy conversion.\nBy unifying the results of radiative and thermoradiative engines within a\ncommon thermodynamic framework, which also encompasses dual-engine\nconfigurations that combine both features, this work provides a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the thermodynamic limits of radiative energy conversion. Our\nframework offers general metrics for evaluating specific devices and raises\ncritical questions regarding the relevance of thermoradiative cells for energy\nproduction."}

However, most models used\nto understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium\napproximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional\nMonte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we\npresent the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating\nat both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic\ndisorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach\nthat accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these\nexample morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic\ndisorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of\nreal device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of\nthe nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results\nreveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact,\nenergetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge\nextraction in interconnected domains.

A unified\ngrowth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations\nor specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as\ndoes an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis\ndynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not\nprescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to\ngrowth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the\nexistence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in\nstress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose\na theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and\nmorphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In\nparticular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for\nthe growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution\nlaws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass\ntransport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric\nsynergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living\nmatter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy\nand, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development.

Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface\nBloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann\ndata. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients\nas a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model\nof the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,\nand ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue\nproblem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a\ngeometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the\nsurface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber\nnormal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber\nin the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is\nderived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths\nare obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the\nQEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both\ndispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a\nlow-dimensional eigenvalue problem.

These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a\nspinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham\nexpansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's\nproof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from\ngauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the\nconformal boundary.\n  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be\nsmooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of\nasymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary\ndata. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary\nstress-energy tensors."}

This matter does not depend on the\ncurvature parameter and is described by a stiff equation of state. It can have\nthe properties of spin matter, consisting of particles with a spin quantum\nnumber (spin) s = 1/2. Such a matter can be plausibly identified with quark\nmatter at the early stage of the evolution of the universe."}

This gravitational-wave signal was assumed\nto be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source\nframe masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\\textup{M}_\\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~\n\\textup{M}_\\odot$ (90\\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors,\nthe signal has only $\\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\\sim 10$ ms.\nIt is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we\npresent the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the\ngravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger,\nor emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string.

The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the\nhighest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic\nor gravitational wave observations.

It has been found that for some special\nblack holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more\nsurprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the\nviolation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for\nthese black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\\alpha$ is often treated as 0\nand can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical\nexponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is\na symmetry violation in the order parameter."}
