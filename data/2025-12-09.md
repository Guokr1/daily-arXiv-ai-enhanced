Abstract: The PANDAWN sensor network in Chicago, IL, is a state-of-the-art test-bed for networked, multi-modal sensing. It integrates AI/data science methods into its operation, from data acquisition to automated data labeling and curation workflows. The curation and dissemination of diverse multi-modal data sets will enable the development of new radiological/nuclear (R/N) detection, localization, and tracking algorithms, and methods relevant across the nonproliferation mission space. This paper first introduces the PANDAWN sensor network and the features that make it stand out from previous multi-modal data acquisition efforts. We then review the various data streams acquired on the PANDAWN nodes, and present the implementation of an automated data curation pipeline that includes the labeling of radiation and contextual data streams. We finally provide a short overview of different studies that leveraged the curated data sets.

### [2] [Physics-based Full-band GaN HEMT Simulation Suggests Upper Bound of LO Phonon Lifetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06226)

TL;DR: GaN HEMT性能受热LO声子限制，研究发现声子寿命需小于40fs才能匹配实验数据，但即使如此热声子效应仍限制高偏压下的电流密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GaN HEMT中热LO声子对器件性能的内在限制。虽然体GaN中LO声子寿命约1ps会导致强非平衡声子群，但无栅极异质结构中寿命仅为几十飞秒。由于HEMT沟道内直接测量困难，热声子的真实影响仍不确定。

Method: 使用全带输运模拟对制造的GaN HEMT进行仿真，通过匹配实验测量的I-V特性来确定LO声子寿命，并分析不同声子寿命下的热声子瓶颈效应。

Result: LO声子寿命必须小于约40fs才能复现测量的I-V特性，这与GaN异质结构中观察到的超快衰减一致。即使这些超快寿命也不足以消除热声子效应：残余的非平衡LO声子群继续限制高偏压下的电流密度。当LO声子寿命超过几十飞秒时，会出现显著的热声子瓶颈，导致与实验不一致的电流密度抑制。

Conclusion: 热LO声子构成GaN HEMT性能的内在瓶颈，声子寿命需保持在几十飞秒以下以避免严重的热声子瓶颈效应，但即使超快衰减也无法完全消除热声子对高偏压下电流密度的限制。

Abstract: Intrinsic limits to device performance arise from fundamental material properties that define the best achievable operation, independent of engineering constraints. In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment.

TL;DR: 提出一种覆盖5G中频段和6G厘米波段的宽带三频共享孔径天线阵列，通过特征模分析和分段螺旋辐射体设计解决宽频带散射和耦合抑制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G和6G通信需要覆盖多个频段的天线阵列，但宽频带工作面临严重的散射和耦合问题，需要设计能够同时抑制这些干扰并保持良好辐射性能的共享孔径天线。

Method: 1) 基于特征模分析(CMA)设计分段螺旋辐射体，抑制高频散射和耦合；2) 使用串联谐振器实现低频段阻抗匹配；3) 采用平面磁电偶极子结构设计中频和高频天线，避免共模谐振并减少跨频段散射；4) 集成三频段天线形成共享孔径阵列。

Conclusion: 该研究成功设计了一种宽带三频共享孔径天线阵列，通过创新的分段螺旋辐射体和磁电偶极子结构，有效解决了宽频带散射和耦合问题，为5G和6G通信系统提供了高性能天线解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents a wideband tri-band shared-aperture antenna array covering the 5G mid-band and 6G centimetric band. The challenge of scattering and coupling suppression is holistically addressed across the wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is developed to mitigate high-frequency scattering and coupling while maintaining low-frequency radiation performance. Compared with a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral achieves a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, the segmented-spiral dipole achieves impedance matching in the low band (LB, 3.05-4.68 GHz, 42.2%), covering the 5G band (3.3-4.2 GHz), while additional suppressors further reduce cross-band coupling. The middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate at 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G bands (6.425-15.35 GHz). Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure to avoid common-mode resonances within the LB and MB and to minimize cross-band scattering in the HB. The proposed array maintains undistorted radiation patterns and better than 20 dB port isolation between any two ports across all three bands.

Conclusion: PDH技术能显著提升微波频率谐振器传感器的测量性能，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: We use the Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique to characterize the frequency stability of a microwave-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator-based sensor. The multi-mode acoustic resonator is integrated in a notch geometry with a transmission line, all fabricated on Y-cut lithium niobate. We measure the amplitude and phase of the resonator transfer function and the PDH signal across the resonator full spectral range. We use these measurements to emphasize the differences between the PDH measurement and a standard Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) technique. As compared to a PLL, we demonstrate that PDH is insensitive to phase error and exhibits a reduced Allan deviation of the center frequency measurement, in each case by up to an order of magnitude. The method rejects spurious effects and background frequency drift, demonstrating the enhancements possible with PDH-based measurements, which can be realized in a wide range of microwave-frequency resonator-based sensors and devices.

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种基于H面T型接头耦合的磁控管对等注入锁定功率合成新方法，无需隔离器和外部注入源，实现了高效率、低成本、紧凑型的功率合成系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁控管作为高性能微波源应用广泛，但单管输出功率受物理限制。传统磁控管功率合成系统使用隔离器带来插入损耗，注入信号源和移相器增加系统尺寸、成本和复杂度。

Method: 利用H面T型接头的两个端口之间的耦合实现磁控管对等注入锁定，同时使用一段波导进行非对称相位补偿来调整磁控管输出特性。通过理论分析和数值计算研究系统输出行为，并搭建实验系统验证。

Result: 实验系统在电波导长度对应90、135和225时，分别实现了90.2%、93.6%和93.6%的最大微波功率合成效率，输出功率分别为1650、1260和1610W，无需任何隔离器或外部注入源。实验结果与数值计算吻合良好。

Conclusion: 该方法具有低成本、紧凑尺寸和低损耗的优势，为未来开发高性能磁控管功率合成系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Magnetrons are widely used as high-performance microwave sources in microwave heating, microwave chemistry, and microwave power transmission due to their high efficiency, low cost, and compact size advantages. However, the output power of a single magnetron is limited by its resonant cavities, posing a physical constraint. High-efficiency coherent power combining based on the injection-locking technique effectively overcomes this limitation and meets the demand for higher output power. Nevertheless, using isolators, such as circulators, introduces significant insertion loss, and the injection signal sources and phase shifters increase the system size, cost, and complexity in a conventional magnetron power combining (MPC) system. A novel method is proposed to utilize the coupling between two ports of an H-plane tee to achieve peer-to-peer injection locking magnetrons. Meanwhile, an asymmetric phase compensation is realized using a section of waveguide to adjust the magnetron output characteristics. Theoretical and numerical analyses provided qualitative insight into the system output behavior. Subsequently, an experimental system was developed for verification. In the experiments, the system achieved maximum microwave power combining efficiencies 90.2%, 93.6%, and 93.6% at electrical waveguide lengths corresponding to 90, 135, and 225, with output powers of 1650, 1260, and 1610 W, respectively, without the use of any isolators or external injection sources. The experimental results show good agreement with numerical calculations. This method offers the advantages of low cost, compact size, and low loss, providing a new approach for developing high-performance MPC systems in the future.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于注入牵引技术的新型微波加热方法，通过同时调制磁控管的输出相位和频率来扩展锁定带宽，从而提高加热均匀性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微波加热技术存在热驻点效应和加热过程控制不足的问题，需要改进加热均匀性

Method: 采用注入牵引技术实现磁控管输出相位和频率的同时调制，扩展注入锁定技术的锁定带宽，通过数值计算和实验验证输出特性

Result: 与传统注入锁定频率扫描相比，该方法将扫描带宽从8MHz扩展到18MHz，并在五杯水负载和吸水纸负载实验中进一步提高了加热均匀性

Conclusion: 注入牵引技术为磁控管在微波加热中的应用提供了更多选择，能够有效改善加热均匀性

Abstract: Conventional microwave heating techniques are limited due to inherent thermal point residency effects and inadequate control over the heating process. A novel method is proposed to enhance microwave heating uniformity using the injection-pulling technique. In this method, the injection-pulling technique is used to achieve simultaneous modulation of both the output phase and frequency of the magnetron, thereby extending the locking bandwidth of the injection-locking technique. The output characteristics of the injection-pulled magnetron were validated through numerical calculations and experiments. Microwave heating experiments were conducted under both a five-cup water load and an absorbent paper load. Compared with conventional injection-locking frequency sweeping, the proposed method not only expands the sweeping bandwidth from 8 to 18 MHz but also further improves heating uniformity, offering more options for magnetron applications in microwave heating.

Abstract: Potable water utilities are currently making great efforts to reduce leakage rates and assure long-term supply to the population due to the challenges of climate change, growing population and water shortage scenarios that have been on them over the last years. One of the most employed methods to reduce leakage includes the installation of pressurereducing valves along the water distribution network and the utilization of pressure management schemes. Pressure management includes different types of control models, which are applied according to the requirements of each site. The most advanced and sophisticated scheme is critical point control, which relies on a flow signal from a measuring device or online communication between the critical point and the valve. This paper proposes the utilization of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, or the SARIMA model, to correlate pressure at the outlet of the valve and pressure on the critical point of the area supplied, aiming to set a fixed pressure in the critical point. The SARIMA model is developed according to historical data logged in the field and then validated. Later, the SARIMA model was tested on a real location in the village of Noja, Spain. The analysis of the field test results prove that the proposed model is feasible to be used since there is no significance difference between the target values set in the critical point and the real values measured in the field. The research proves that the SARIMA model can be used as an alternative for critical point control in water distribution networks when no flow signal is available or when communication between the critical point and the pressure reducing valve is not an option.

Abstract: Achieving all-to-all coherent networks is critical for the advancement of large-scale coherent computing and communication protocols. By exploiting the resonant dipole-dipole interaction between distant spin ensembles coupled to a one-dimensional coplanar waveguide (CPW) terminated by a mirror, we successfully demonstrate an on-demand all-to-all selective coherent network between four spin ensembles. Furthermore, by repositioning the spin ensembles along the CPW, we achieve collective coupling, and demonstrate coherent energy exchange between multiple spin ensembles in the time domain. These results strongly indicate the potential of this device as a medium-scale all-to-all network structure, which is poised to advance the exploration of many-body physics and enhance coherent information processing capabilities.

Abstract: This work proposes a tri-band shared-aperture antenna array with three wide bands, covering the 5G mid-band and the 6G centimetric band, which is a promising candidate for future 6G base station antennas. The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands.

TL;DR: 提出一种具有可重构功能的低功率整流器，通过并联p-i-n二极管在输入功率过高时改变电路结构，保护整流二极管免受过功率和反向击穿


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境电磁能量收集系统中，整流器输入功率低，通常使用对低功率敏感的肖特基二极管。但这些二极管反向击穿电压低，在高功率条件下容易发生反向击穿，需要保护机制。

Method: 将整流二极管与p-i-n二极管并联。低输入功率时，p-i-n二极管保持关断，不影响整流器工作。当输入功率增加时，p-i-n二极管导通，改变电路结构和阻抗匹配，增加反射功率，防止整流二极管接收过多功率。

Result: p-i-n二极管的导通电压低于整流二极管的反向击穿电压，能够有效保护整流二极管免受过功率损坏和反向击穿。

Conclusion: 提出的可重构低功率整流器设计能够在不同输入功率条件下自动调整电路结构，既保持了低功率下的高效率整流，又提供了高功率条件下的保护功能。

Abstract: In ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting systems, the input power to the rectifier is low. To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown.

Abstract: Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication.

Conclusion: yieldplotlib为HWO任务的系外行星产量估算提供了重要的可视化支持，有助于确保任务成功并促进科学界对这些关键工具的理解和使用

Abstract: NASA's next flagship observatory, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), aims to detect and charaterize ~25 habitable zone planets. The total number of habitable zone planets detected is referred to as the exo-Earth "yield'' and accurate yield estimates will be critically important to the mission's success. Tools like the Altruistic Yield Optimizer (AYO) and EXOSIMS provide these yield estimates but differ in language, methods, and outputs. yieldplotlib provides a unified library that can visualize the inputs and outputs of these yield codes in a complete, descriptive, and accessible way.

TL;DR: 开发了面向瞬变源的快速成像器FIP-TOI，基于SVD和GPU并行化，相比标准成像器WSClean将脉冲星定位速度提升约10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速定位脉冲星等天体瞬变源需要高效的短时标成像，但传统射电天文成像器针对长时间积分优化，限制了快速成像管道的效率

Method: 开发基于奇异值分解(SVD)的瞬变源导向成像器(TOI)，在NVIDIA GPU上使用CUDA并行化，并与先进瞬变探测器FITrig集成形成FIP-TOI系统

Result: 对于4K×4K像素图像，FIP-TOI相比使用标准成像器WSClean的管道将定位速度提升约10倍，在多种数据集上均表现出稳健性能

Conclusion: FIP-TOI系统实现了实时高精度脉冲星候选体定位，为快速射电瞬变源探测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Rapid localisation of celestial transients like pulsars requires efficient short-timescale imaging. In radio astronomy, Fast Imaging Pipeline (FIP) addresses this need by reconstructing radio astronomical images and identifying candidates statistically. The FIP comprises imaging and localisation components but conventional radio astronomical imagers, optimised for longer integrations, limit its efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a Transient-Oriented Imager (TOI) is developed based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and parallelised on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Integrating the TOI with an advanced transient detector, FITrig, forms the FIP-TOI enabling real-time and high-precision localisation of pulsar candidates. For 4K x 4K-pixel images, FIP-TOI accelerates localisation by roughly tenfold compared to a pipeline using the standard imager WSClean. Testing on diverse datasets -- including fields with multiple pulsars, an on-and-off pulsar, and a pulsar exhibiting intensity changes -- FIP-TOI demonstrates robust performance across all scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速射电暴（FRBs）是来源未知的毫秒级高能脉冲，需要专门的宽视场射电望远镜进行探测和精确定位。BURSTT望远镜旨在实现每年探测约50个FRB并具备亚角秒级定位能力。

Abstract: The Bustling Universe Radio Survey Telescope in Taiwan (BURSTT) is a new-generation wide-angle radio telescope specifically designed to survey Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), energetic millisecond-duration pulses of unknown extragalactic origin. To realize its scientific potential, which includes detecting approximately 50 FRBs per year and sub-arcsecond localization capability, the system is designed to perform real-time beamforming and pulse search over the \SI{60}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{120}{\degree} field of view. This paper provides a detailed account of the design, implementation, and performance validation of the BURSTT back-end System. The system employs an efficient multi-stage processing architecture: initial beamforming is executed on the Xilinx ZCU216 RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC) platform; data is then transferred to Intel Xeon servers, where AVX-512 and AMX instruction sets are utilized for the second stage of beamforming and channelization, achieving high computational efficiency to ensure real-time capability. A highly optimized \texttt{bonsai} de-dispersion algorithm performs a real-time pulse search and triggering across 256 beams, which, upon detection, issues commands to the distributed outrigger system to save voltage data for very-long baseline interferometry (VLBI) precise localization. System performance has been validated through beamforming tests using bright radio sources and real-time detection of known pulsars, confirming the high fidelity of the signal processing pipeline.

TL;DR: 使用MWA望远镜的GLEAM-X巡天数据，在72-231 MHz频段搜索地球同步轨道卫星的无意无线电发射，未发现明显证据，建立了未来监测的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近研究表明低地球轨道卫星的无意无线电发射日益普遍，地球同步轨道卫星的此类发射可能对低频平方公里阵列造成显著射频干扰，需要进行监测。

Method: 利用MWA望远镜的GLEAM-X巡天数据（2020年），在Dec=1.6度指向（方位角固定，靠近天赤道）进行观测。使用一晚数据在72-231 MHz频段，对最多162颗地球同步轨道卫星的预测坐标进行叠加成像，搜索无意无线电发射。

Result: 大多数情况下达到优于1 mW等效全向辐射功率（30.72 MHz带宽，双极化）的4σ上限，最佳限制低于10 μW。在这些检测阈值下未发现无意发射的令人信服的证据。

Conclusion: 建立了地球同步轨道卫星无意无线电发射监测的基准，为未来比较提供基础。地球同步轨道卫星的此类发射可能对低频平方公里阵列造成显著射频干扰，需要持续监测。

Abstract: We search data from the GLEAM-X survey, obtained with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) in 2020, for the presence of radio frequency interference from distant Earth-orbiting satellites, in the form of unintended emissions similar to those recently seen from objects in Low Earth Orbits (LEO). Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究旋转膜世界黑洞在色散等离子体环境中的阴影，利用EHT观测数据约束膜世界引力参数和等离子体参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索膜世界引力理论中旋转黑洞的阴影特征，评估EHT观测数据对膜世界引力参数和等离子体环境的约束能力。

Method: 使用Kerr-Newman-like度规描述旋转膜世界黑洞（参数：质量M、自旋a、潮汐电荷q），考虑非均匀和均匀等离子体环境（参数α_i），研究光线传播和阴影形态。

Result: 等离子体密度增加时：非均匀等离子体减小阴影尺寸，均匀等离子体增大阴影尺寸；q<0增大阴影直径，q>0减小阴影直径。EHT数据约束：M87*的q范围约-1.15到0.45，Sgr A*约-0.65到0.8（低密度等离子体极限）。高密度等离子体下，阴影尺寸由背景度规和等离子体环境共同决定。

Conclusion: 在M87*和Sgr A*的低密度等离子体环境中，阴影尺寸主要由背景几何决定；若超大质量黑洞被高密度等离子体包围，则阴影尺寸同时受背景度规和等离子体环境影响。EHT观测数据可用于约束膜世界引力参数和等离子体环境。

Abstract: We investigate the shadow of a rotating braneworld black hole in dispersive plasma environments and assess the potential of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations to constrain braneworld gravity. The spacetime around a rotating braneworld black hole is modelled by a Kerr-Newman-like metric determined by its mass $M$, spin $a$, and tidal charge $q$, which encodes the gravitational effects of the bulk spacetime. We consider both inhomogeneous and homogeneous plasma environments characterized by plasma parameters $α_i$ ($i=1,2\text{ and }3$) to study light propagation and the interplay of the background spacetime and the plasma environment in influencing the shadow size and shape. We find that as the plasma density increases, inhomogeneous plasma environments decrease the shadow size, however homogeneous plasma enlarges it. On studying the effect due to background spacetime we find that $q<0$ (negative tidal charge) increases the shadow diameter, while $q>0$ decreases it. Using the EHT measurements of M87* and Sgr A*, we constrain the $(q,α_i)$ parameter space. The EHT data constrains the tidal charge in the range $-1.15 \lesssim q \lesssim 0.45$ for M87* and $-0.65 \lesssim q \lesssim 0.8$ for Sgr A* in the low density plasma limit. As the plasma density increases, the data exhibits a preference towards negative tidal charge for inhomogeneous plasma environments and positive tidal charge for homogeneous plasma environments. Our study reveals that the size of the shadow is primarily governed by the background geometry in presence of low density plasma environments such as that observed in M87* and Sgr A*. However, if supermassive blackholes are surrounded by high density plasma then the shadow size is dictated by both the background metric and the plasma environment.

Conclusion: 机器学习策略为全天连续引力波搜索提供了有前景的替代方案，能够提高中子星探测效率，缩小观测与理论估计之间的差距

Abstract: Between the estimated population of Neutron Stars (NSs) and the actual number present in the catalogs, there is a huge gap: O(10$^{8-9}$) vs O(10$^3$). Among the different search techniques for Continuous gravitational waves (CWs), the all-sky could help to reduce the discrepancy. We focus on the all-sky CW pipeline Frequency Hough (FH), which operates without prior knowledge of the source parameters ($f,\dot{f}, λ, β$). Here, we present a Machine Learning strategy, diverging from the standard follow-up(FU) of the FH pipeline. We study the performance with real interferometer data, until reaching $h$ value subthreshold for the standard FU procedure ($CR_{thr}=5$), with encouraging classification results.

Method: 通过分析声学黑洞中的波方程结构，识别其与广义相对论黑洞时空中的对称性相似性，并建立两者之间的对称性联系。

Result: 发现声学黑洞中的阶梯对称性可以追溯到其基础波方程的结构特性，这些特性与广义相对论黑洞时空中的特性相似。

Conclusion: 黑洞和声学黑洞中潮汐Love数的消失现象都源于相似的对称性结构，这表明两种系统在对称性方面存在深层次联系。

Abstract: Tidal Love numbers characterize the conservative, static response of compact objects to external tidal fields. Remarkably, these quantities vanish identically for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional General Relativity. This behavior has been attributed to hidden symmetries -- both geometric and algebraic -- governing perturbations in these space-times. Interestingly, a similar vanishing of selected multipolar Love numbers arises in the context of supersonic acoustic flows. These systems share several key features with black holes in General Relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations. In this work, we explore a symmetry-based connection between the two frameworks and demonstrate that the ladder symmetries observed in acoustic black holes can be traced to structural properties of the underlying wave equation, mirroring those found in general relativistic black hole space-times.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DESI观测数据显示暗能量状态参数w可能在红移z~0.5时发生从w<-1到w>-1的变化（称为逆幽灵穿越），这挑战了标准宇宙学模型。需要构建理论模型来解释这种可能的观测现象。

Method: 在标量-爱因斯坦-高斯-博内引力和无幽灵f(G)引力框架下构建实现幽灵穿越的模型。同时研究表观幽灵穿越方案，其中暗物质能量密度下降比通常预期更慢。还提出新方案，将标量场粒子视为暗物质，其质量因与高斯-博内不变量耦合而增加。

Result: 成功构建了实现幽灵穿越的模型，并提出了表观幽灵穿越方案。在提出的方案中，宇宙流体的任何分量都不违反能量条件。新方案中暗物质粒子质量增加使其能量密度下降更慢，这可能解释DESI观测。

Conclusion: 逆幽灵穿越现象可以在标量-爱因斯坦-高斯-博内引力框架下实现。表观幽灵穿越方案提供了解释DESI观测的可行途径，其中暗物质能量密度下降更慢可能产生类似w变化的效应。最后提出的方案暗示逆幽灵穿越可能与宇宙从减速膨胀到加速膨胀的转变有关。

Abstract: The recent observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicated the possibility that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ might change from $w<-1$ to $w>-1$ when the redshift $z\sim 0.5$, which is called the inverse phantom crossing. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.

Conclusion: 量子隧穿方法为理解霍金辐射提供了有效的半经典框架，特别是对动态黑洞的扩展处理；实验技术的发展为验证这一理论提供了新的可能性，尽管直接探测仍然面临挑战。

Abstract: This paper presents a concise review of the quantum tunneling approach to Hawking radiation, covering its theoretical foundations, extensions, and experimental efforts. We begin by outlining the Hamilton-Jacobi and Parikh-Wilczek methods, which provide a semi-classical framework for deriving Hawking radiation from stationary black holes. The discussion is then extended to dynamical black holes, where evolving horizons require modified treatments incorporating trapping horizons, Kodama vectors, and dynamical surface gravity. We explored the possible tunneling paths for particles crossing the horizon in dynamical black holes and emphasized the crucial role of the imaginary part of the action in determining the Hawking temperature. In the second part, we review experimental investigations of Hawking radiation, including analogue black hole experiments, quantum simulations, and astrophysical searches for primordial black hole evaporation. While no direct detection of Hawking radiation has been achieved, recent advances in Bose-Einstein condensates, optical analogues, and superconducting qubits offer indirect support for the tunneling interpretation of black hole evaporation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引力波探测任务中的电荷管理需要平衡充电与放电速率，同时减少电荷测量的频率需求。传统使用255nm波长的直接照射方法存在局限性，需要探索更长波长的UV-LED以实现更优性能。

Method: 采用模拟LISA Pathfinder立方体测试质量块表面特性和功函数的复杂惯性传感器模型，研究使用269nm、275nm、280nm和295nm波长的UV-LED的双极电荷管理系统，这些波长比常用的255nm更长。

Result: 实验结果表明，275nm UV-LED表现最佳，能够将测试质量块电位维持在接近零的水平，同时支持快速放电和连续放电两种策略。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来电荷管理系统的设计和优化提供了有用参考，特别是275nm UV-LED在平衡性能和策略灵活性方面显示出优势。

Abstract: For the charge management system in gravitational wave detection missions, a continuous discharge strategy is considered by continuously illuminating a test mass (TM) with weak light in such a way to strike a balance between the charging and discharging rates and at the same time avoids the requirement for frequent activation of charge measurements. Built on experiments by one of us based on a simple parallel plate model for inertial sensor, in the present work a more sophisticated inertial sensor model that mimics the surface properties and work function of a cubical TM of an inertial sensor in space (like that of the LISA Pathfinder) is employed to study bipolar charge management system that utilizes UV-LEDs with peak wavelengths of 269 nm, 275 nm, 280 nm, and 295 nm that are longer than the standard 255 nm commonly employed for direct TM illumination. Experimental results indicate that the 275 nm UV-LED achieves optimal performance, maintaining the TM potential closer to zero and at the same time accommodates both rapid discharge and continuous discharge strategies. The present work provides useful input in the future study of system design and optimization for the charge management system.

Motivation: 解决一些作者在特殊相对论处理线性萨格纳克效应时感知到的所谓不一致性问题，澄清这种感知困难的根源。

Method: 通过分析线性萨格纳克效应的绝对性本质，并与双生子悖论的标准解法进行类比，揭示问题的本质。

Result: 证明所谓的困难实际上源于对双生子悖论标准解法的不适应，而非狭义相对论的内在矛盾。线性萨格纳克效应是绝对效应，任何保持狭义相对论物理内容的约定性同时性调整都无法解决这一感知问题。

Conclusion: 线性萨格纳克效应中感知到的不一致性并非狭义相对论的问题，而是对双生子悖论标准解法理解困难的体现。问题的根源在于心理上的不适应，而非理论本身的缺陷。

Abstract: We deal with a problem concerning a supposed inconsistency in the special relativistic treatment of the so-called linear Sagnac effect. It is shown that, under modern clothes, the root of the difficulty perceived by some authors lies in their uneasiness with the standard solution of the twin paradox. In particular, since the linear Sagnac effect is an absolute effect, no tinkering with conventionality of simultaneity, so far as it preserves the physical content of special relativity, would get us out of the supposed trouble.

Motivation: GW200105是首个显示偏心特征且为中子星-黑洞双星的引力波探测事件，这需要能够处理准椭圆轨道上潮汐效应的波形模型。现有波形缺乏对偏心轨道上有限尺寸效应（如潮汐变形）的完整处理。

Method: 采用后牛顿框架，在2.5阶相对后牛顿精度下，包含质量型四极矩和八极矩以及流型四极矩变形的绝热近似。首先推导保守运动的准开普勒参数化，然后将径向分离和相位及其时间导数用轨道频率、时间偏心率和偏近点角表示。通过反解广义开普勒方程获得时间函数，并讨论偏心展开结果的收敛性。

Conclusion: 该研究为偏心中子星-黑洞双星系统提供了包含潮汐效应的完整波形模型框架，填补了现有波形模型在处理偏心轨道有限尺寸效应方面的空白，为GW200105等类似事件的精确分析提供了理论基础。

Abstract: GW200105 is the first gravitational wave detection to show signs of eccentricity, it also is a neutron star - blackhole binary. This raises the need for waveforms that incorporate tidal effects on quasi-elliptic orbits. We tackle the problem of finite size effects within the post-Newtonian framework, including the mass-type quadrupole and octupole, as well as the current-type quadrupole deformations in the adiabatic approximation. The computations are performed at the second-and-a-half relative post-Newtonian order. We first derive the quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the conservative motion; we then express the radial separation and phase with their time derivatives in terms of the orbital frequency, the time eccentricity and the eccentric anomaly. To obtain these as functions of time, we invert the generalized Kepler equation while also discussing the convergence of eccentricity expanded results. We provide those results to the fourteenth order in eccentricity. Finally, we exploit the already known radiation reaction term of the acceleration in order to derive the secular and oscillatory evolutions of the orbital elements. The companion paper contains the derivation of the radiated fluxes and the amplitude modes of the strain. All relevant results are provided in an ancillary file.

Conclusion: MCG模型能够描述从准静态相到类de Sitter膨胀的完整宇宙演化，自然趋近于ΛCDM极限，为宇宙演化提供了统一的框架。

Abstract: The Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) model is revisited to examine its ability to describe the full cosmic evolution within a single framework. Because the field equations are highly nonlinear, no closed analytical solution for the scale factor in terms of cosmic time exists. To address this limitation and determine the flip time along with other physical characteristics, we introduce an alternative first order approximation that yields an exact analytical expression for the scale factor. This approach gives rise to an emergent, non singular cosmological scenario in which the universe begins with a finite minimum size and evolves smoothly from a quasi static phase to a de Sitter like expansion at late times, naturally approaching the LambdaCDM limit. Using Hubble observational data, we constrain the equation of state parameters and obtain the viable ranges 0 < alpha < 1 and 0 < A < 1/3. The effective equation of state parameter evolves from a positive value in the early matter dominated era to approximately minus one at late times, consistent with observations. A complementary analysis based on the Raychaudhuri equation further supports the robustness of the model.

Abstract: We revisit the global structure of the extended Kerr spacetime and of a broader class of Kerr-type spacetimes possessing ring singularities. By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r>0$ and $r<0$) of the spacetime.
  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.
  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.
  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities.

Abstract: Rotating black holes can form dense boson clouds through superradiant instability, making Kerr black holes a powerful probe of ultralight massive bosons. Previous studies of black hole superradiance have often treated bosonic fields classically, leaving open questions about how particles are produced and how the clouds grow over time. In this work, we canonically quantize a massive scalar field around a Kerr black hole, providing a fully quantum description of black hole superradiance. We show that the evolution of the particle number in the cloud, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the scalar field, can be consistently explained within the standard framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we prove that the growth of the cloud occurs independently of the choice of initial state. We also explore several phenomena related to a massive scalar field in a rotating black hole spacetime, including Hawking radiation, adiabatic backreaction on the black hole spin, and the direction of level transitions in the presence of self-interactions of the field. Our analysis provides a consistent quantum-mechanical perspective that includes all these phenomena.

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $μ\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究半开放系统中黑洞的扰动特性，通过在事件视界周围添加部分反射壁来探索准正规模、灰体因子和异常点等物理现象，理解反射边界条件对黑洞动力学的影响。

Method: 使用Heun函数分析Schwarzschild-de Sitter黑洞在半开放系统中的扰动，引入频率无关的反射率参数K，研究三种不同类型的准正规模行为，分析灰体因子在不同反射率下的表现，并将K推广为复数参数以研究二阶异常点。

Result: 发现准正规模随反射率增加呈现三种不同行为：第一类模趋近实轴形成长寿命准束缚态；第二类模趋近但不接触实轴保持有限衰减率；第三类模最终位于虚轴成为纯衰减模。灰体因子在实常数反射率下表现出由势垒与反射壁距离控制的强振荡，而Boltzmann型反射率仅产生小修正。通过复数反射率参数化异常点附近区域，观察到模交换现象，谱偏离随参数偏离的平方根变化。

Conclusion: 半开放系统中黑洞扰动表现出丰富的物理现象，反射边界条件显著影响准正规模谱和灰体因子特性，异常点的存在揭示了参数空间中模交换的临界行为，为理解黑洞动力学提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study perturbations of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in semi-open systems by using the Heun functions. For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion.

Conclusion: 该一阶公式化方法分离了演化方程和约束方程的本质内容，为修正引力中球对称塌缩的几何分析和鲁棒数值模拟提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We develop a first-order formulation of the field equations in f(R) gravity governing the global evolution of a (possibly massive) scalar field under spherical symmetry. Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity.

Conclusion: 通过Agostiniani-Mazzieri-Oronzio流中组合面积-角动量泛函的单调性得到结果，这是第一个同时包含视界面积和角动量的几何不等式，对相关物理领域有重要影响。

Abstract: We prove the Angular Momentum Penrose Inequality for axisymmetric vacuum initial data satisfying the dominant energy condition. This inequality establishes a sharp lower bound on the ADM mass in terms of both the horizon area and the Komar angular momentum of a black hole, with equality achieved precisely by the Kerr solution. The proof combines four main ingredients: solving an axisymmetric Jang equation where twist enters as a lower-order perturbation, establishing conformal factor bounds via a divergence identity, proving angular momentum conservation along level sets using de Rham cohomology, and applying the proven Dain-Reiris area-angular momentum inequality for sub-extremality. The monotonicity of a combined area-angular momentum functional along the Agostiniani-Mazzieri-Oronzio flow yields the result. This provides the first geometric inequality incorporating both horizon area and angular momentum, with implications for cosmic censorship, black hole thermodynamics, and gravitational wave observations of spinning black holes.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文指出许多声称构建黑洞嵌入暗物质晕的度规方法存在根本性错误，这些方法错误地将牛顿关系直接应用于相对论框架，导致得到的解并非真正的暗物质晕黑洞解，而是不同的各向异性流体配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来多篇论文声称构建了描述黑洞嵌入经验性暗物质密度分布（如NFW、Burkert、Einasto等）的爱因斯坦方程解。本文旨在揭示这些方法中的系统性错误，澄清这些度规实际上并不代表所声称的暗物质晕黑洞。

Method: 通过分析文献中基于各种暗物质密度分布（NFW、Burkert、Einasto、solitonic、pseudo-isothermal、Dehnen-(1,4,5/2)等）构建的度规，指出这些方法错误地将牛顿关系v_t^2=GM(r)/r直接应用于相对论框架，并随意假设g(r)=f(r)。这导致得到的是各向异性流体（P_r=-ρ, P_t=-rρ'/2-ρ），其密度分布与声称的晕轮廓不同，且在视界附近常违反弱能量条件。

Result: 分析表明这些文献中构建的度规并非真正的暗物质晕黑洞解，而是不同的各向异性流体配置。对于每个案例，论文提供了正确的爱因斯坦一致形式度规及其物理解释，澄清了牛顿近似在致密天体附近的适用范围。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了在广义相对论中构建暗物质启发的黑洞几何时常见的系统性错误，建立了构建此类度规的一致框架，并明确了牛顿近似在黑洞附近的局限性。

Abstract: A number of recent papers have claimed to construct solutions of Einstein's equations describing black holes surrounded by dark-matter halos with empirically motivated density profiles such as the Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Einasto, pseudo-isothermal, and solitonic distributions. We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P_r=-ρ$ and $P_t=-rρ'/2-ρ$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo. For each case, the correct Einstein-consistent form of the metric and the associated physical interpretation are provided. Our analysis clarifies the limits of validity of the Newtonian approximation near compact objects and establishes a consistent framework for constructing dark-matter-inspired black-hole geometries within General Relativity.

Abstract: We apply a finite-time geometric optimization framework to investigate thermal fluctuations and (non)equilibrium optimal processes in the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ black hole. Employing Hessian thermodynamic information metrics, we construct geodesic trajectories that define optimal protocols connecting distinct thermodynamic configurations. Finite-time state transitions are described by paths that extremize entropy production or energy dissipation, depending on the chosen thermodynamic representation. This work presents the first formulation of a geometric optimal control theory for the BTZ black hole.

Motivation: 研究广义爱因斯坦-标量-高斯-博内模型的解析解，探索包含标量场与高斯-博内不变量的非最小耦合对宇宙演化的影响，特别是暗能量起源和宇宙加速膨胀机制。

Method: 应用Noether对称方法获得解析解；通过变分原理推导运动方程和张量扰动传播速度；使用宇宙钟、重子声学振荡和Ia型超新星数据验证模型；基于信息准则进行模型选择；分析慢滚参数、谱指数和张量-标量比研究早期宇宙动力学。

Result: 哈勃参数包含来自刚性能量和暗能量的贡献；信息准则显示该新框架略优于ΛCDM模型；模型稳定（声速为正且无Ostrogradsky鬼）；在z≈0.66处存在从减速到加速膨胀的转变；早期宇宙动力学与Planck 2018和ACT观测完全一致。

Conclusion: 该广义爱因斯坦-标量-高斯-博内模型能成功描述宇宙演化，包括从减速到加速膨胀的转变，且在观测约束下表现良好，为ΛCDM模型提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: By applying Noether symmetry methods, analytic solutions are obtained for a generalized Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model with a $ξ(φ)f(G)$ component. Variation with respect to the metric, supplemented by small perturbations, produces the equations of motion and the terms that determine the propagation speed of tensor perturbations. The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''. The total equation of state parameter hints towards the presence of a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion at $z\approx 0.66$, corresponding to the transition from matter to dark energy dominance. Early Universe dynamics, derived from the slow-roll parameters, spectral indices, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, are found to be perfectly consistent with observations from Planck 2018 and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope.

TL;DR: 该研究扩展了之前关于双中子星系统偏心轨道对引力波参数估计影响的工作，加入了自旋参数，发现偏心会导致系统偏差，特别是有效潮汐形变参数的偏差显著依赖于质量和自旋参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究已经探讨了偏心轨道对无自旋双中子星系统引力波参数估计的影响，但实际的双中子星系统通常具有自旋。本研究旨在将分析扩展到更现实的情况，即包含自旋参数的双中子星系统，以全面评估偏心轨道对参数估计的影响。

Method: 采用解析的Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri方法计算使用非偏心波形进行参数估计时可能产生的系统偏差，并通过与数值贝叶斯参数估计结果比较来验证方法的可靠性。生成了10^4个随机分布在参数空间（质量、有效自旋、偏心度）的双中子星源，并计算了啁啾质量、对称质量比、有效自旋和有效潮汐形变参数的系统偏差。

Result: 啁啾质量、对称质量比和有效自旋的偏差分布呈现窄带，随偏心度增加呈二次增长或减少，表明偏差对这三个参数的依赖性较弱。而有效潮汐形变参数的偏差分布广泛，在给定偏心度下显著依赖于质量和自旋参数的值。通过贝叶斯参数估计验证了这些偏差对中子星性质推断的影响。

Conclusion: 偏心轨道会在引力波参数估计中引入系统偏差，特别是对有效潮汐形变参数的偏差显著依赖于系统质量和自旋。在分析双中子星引力波信号时，必须考虑偏心轨道的影响，否则可能导致对中子星性质（如状态方程）的错误推断。

Abstract: In our previous work [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 105}. 124022 (2022)], we studied the impact of eccentricity on gravitational-wave parameter estimation for a nonspinning binary neutron star (BNS) system. We here extend the work to a more realistic case by including the spin parameter in the system. As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$χ_{\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\odot \leq m_{1,2}\leq 2M_\odot (m_2 \leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \leq χ_{\rm eff} \leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \leq e_0 \leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($λ$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($Δθ$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($η$), effective spin ($χ_{\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\tildeλ$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, η$, and $χ_{\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\tildeλ$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$. We investigate the implications of biased parameters for the inference of neutron star properties by performing Bayesian parameter estimation for specific cases.

Conclusion: 手征涡旋环的动力学和进动特征提供了与Kerr黑洞不同的独特观测特征，这些特征可能为探测涡旋环提供潜在的观测途径，特别是在暗物质探测和大统一理论检验方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: Vortons are of interest in high-energy physics as possible dark matter candidates and as probes of Grand Unified Theories. Using the recently derived weak-field metric for a chiral vorton, we study the dynamics of test particles by analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. We identify several classes of trajectories, including bound precessing orbits, circular orbits, toroidal, and crown-type oscillations, as well as unbound scattering paths. Poincare surfaces of section reveal transitions between regular and chaotic motions that depend sensitively on the vorton tension $Gμ$ and initial conditions. We further compute the Lense-Thirring and general spin-precession frequencies for gyroscopes along Killing trajectories. The resulting precession profiles exhibit several distinct features not present in Kerr black holes but reminiscent of Kerr naked singularities, such as: divergences near the ring core, and multi-minima structures. These dynamical and precessional signatures may offer potential observational pathways for detecting vortons.

Abstract: Binet's equation provides a direct way to obtain the geometric shape of orbits in a central force field. It is well known that in Newtonian gravitation Binet's equation leads to all the conic curves as solutions for an inverse-square force. In this work, we show how Binet's equation arises from the horizontal and vertical infinitesimal displacements of a body in free fall and in inertial motion. This derivation uses elementary concepts of infinitesimal calculus. Second, we derive the relativistic version of Binet's equation for the Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter metric. This derivation, which is novel, directly relates the coordinates involved in Binet's equation without the need to introduce potentials or the use of Killing vectors. Finally, we tackle some controversies related to the role of the cosmological constant in the trajectory of photons in a Schwarzschild-(anti-)de Sitter or even in Reissner-Nordström-(anti-)de Sitter spacetimes.

Method: 研究提供了对最一般球对称时空在体粘性流存在下的运动学自相似解的系统分类。利用引力理论中的自相似性和标度不变性原理，将偏微分方程简化为常微分方程进行分析。

Result: 建立了体粘性流存在下球对称时空运动学自相似解的分类体系，这些解作为吸引子表征渐近动力学行为，并为更一般解的渐近行为提供特征描述。

Conclusion: 运动学自相似解在引力理论中具有重要意义，它们作为吸引子描述系统的渐近行为，特别是在体粘性流存在下的球对称时空情况。系统分类为理解这类解的数学结构和物理意义提供了框架。

Abstract: The scale-free nature of gravitational interaction in both Newtonian gravity and the general theory of relativity gives rise to the concept of self-similarity, where solutions are scale invariant. As a result of this property, the governing partial differential equations are greatly simplified and can be transformed into ordinary ones. These solutions function as attractors, characterizing the asymptotic dynamics of more general solutions. There exist situations in which self-similarity is only partially realized, giving rise to kinematic self-similar solutions. Our study provides a systematic classification of kinematic self-similar solutions corresponding to the most general spherically symmetric spacetime in the presence of bulk viscous flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有自相互作用的旋转玻色星链在爱因斯坦引力框架下的性质，探索多分量系统中自相互作用如何影响系统的全局特性和稳定性，特别关注奇偶链数在物理行为上的差异。

Method: 在爱因斯坦引力耦合复标量场的模型中引入四次或六次自相互作用，数值构造这些多分量系统，分析自相互作用对ADM质量M、角动量J和遍历层形态的影响，特别关注频率ω变化时的系统行为。

Result: 发现奇偶链数在(ω, M)和(ω, J)关系上呈现不同模式：偶数分量系统显示螺旋曲线，奇数分量系统显示环状结构；观察到随着频率增加，两个初始分离的遍历层会合并为单一遍历层；四次相互作用对奇数链存在更严格的限制，而六次相互作用允许在更强耦合下存在稳定解。

Conclusion: 旋转玻色星链的性质强烈依赖于链中分量的奇偶性和自相互作用的类型，四次相互作用对奇数链施加更严格的存在界限，而六次相互作用在强耦合下仍能支持稳定解，这为理解多分量引力束缚系统的稳定性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates chains of rotating boson stars (BSs) within Einstein gravity coupled to a complex scalar field. The model incorporates quartic or sextic self-interactions in the scalar Lagrangian, which support the existence of stationary, solitonic, gravitationally bound solutions. We numerically construct these multi-component systems and investigate how the self-interactions alter their global properties -- specifically the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass $M$, the angular momentum $J$ and the morphology of their ergospheres. A central result is the distinct dependence of the $(ω, M)$ and $(ω, J)$ relations on the parity of the chains. Specifically, systems with an even number of constituents display spiraling curves, while those with an odd number exhibit loop structures. Moreover, we observe that two initially distinct ergospheres merge into a single one as the frequency $ω$ increases. Our analysis also indicates that the quartic interaction imposes more restrictive existence bounds, particularly for odd-numbered chains, thereby restricting stable configurations to the weak-coupling regime. In contrast, the sextic interaction has a weaker effect and enables stable solutions at substantially stronger couplings.

Motivation: 研究史瓦西引力背景下的散射问题，探索其可积性结构。先前工作基于柯西叶层化，本文转向超双曲面叶层化方案，其中动力学的时间生成元是非自伴算子，旨在揭示这种框架下的可积性特征。

Method: 采用超双曲面叶层化方案，构建弱Lax对（在零无穷远条件下有效），推导相关的等谱流无穷序列。分析非自伴时间算子分解为体结构和边界结构两部分。

Conclusion: 史瓦西引力散射在超双曲面叶层化下展现出可积性结构，通过Lax对方法建立了弱可积系统。时间算子的体-边界分解为用"波-平均流"方法描述黑洞强引力动力学提供了理论基础，类似于该研究线最近提出的方法。

Abstract: Integrability structures are known to play a key role in one-dimensional scattering. In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the "KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a "semi-direct action" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the "wave-mean flow" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research.

Abstract: We present a novel derivation of scalar cosmological perturbations in the scalar-tensor extension of non-metricity gravity, where the non-metricity scalar $Q$ is non-minimally coupled to a dynamical scalar field. While previous investigations of symmetric teleparallel gravity focused primarily on background evolution or specialised gauge choices, a complete treatment of scalar perturbations in this non-minimally coupled framework has remained unexplored. In this work, we derive the full set of perturbed field equations, impose the quasi-static approximation, and obtain the effective Poisson equation together with the corresponding modified gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}$. These ingredients allow us to construct the density contrast evolution equation and analyse the matter growth rate and growth index. Through numerical analysis, we showed that the scalar non-metricity theory is comparable to the well-known $ΛCDM$ model to some extent. The results provide a foundation for testing scalar non-metricity theories against large-scale structure observations and open new avenues for constraining non-minimally coupled non-metricity cosmologies.

Abstract: In general relativity, the dynamics of spinning particles is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, which are most commonly applied to massive bodies, but the framework also works in the massless case. Such massless versions naturally arise, for example, in the description of energy centroids of high-frequency wave packets. In this work, we consider massless spinning particles in spacetimes with hidden symmetries and we derive the generalized conservation laws associated with conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We then show that the spin Hall equations, a particular case of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations restricted to massless particles with longitudinal angular momentum, are completely integrable in a large class of type D spacetimes. Additionally, we also show that for massive spinning particles, the generalized Carter constant associated with Killing-Yano tensors is conserved independently of the choice of spin supplementary condition.

Motivation: 探索拓扑结构在引力理解中的作用，特别是Bianchi-Kantowski-Sachs时空与Thurston几何之间的强相互作用，研究明确依赖Thurston几何的引力理论中的非倾斜BKS解。

Method: 研究非倾斜Bianchi-Kantowski-Sachs解，分析在依赖Thurston几何的引力理论中的解特性，包括无剪切完美流体解和静态真空解，并考察正宇宙常数下的各向同性化行为。

Result: 证明了在所有拓扑结构下都存在无剪切完美流体解和静态真空解；除非旋转对称Bianchi II模型外，所有BKS度量在正宇宙常数下都会各向同性化；当弱能量条件满足时，不可能发生再坍缩。这些结果不需要比广义相对论更多的参数。

Conclusion: 该框架与广义相对论形成对比（在GR中Bianchi IX和KS度量的这些性质不成立），可能允许在任何拓扑结构中构建简单的暴胀模型，为拓扑在引力理论中的作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: The strong interplay between Bianchi--Kantowski--Sachs (BKS) spacetimes and Thurston geometries motivates the exploration of the role of topology in our understanding of gravity. As such, we study non-tilted BKS solutions of a theory of gravity that explicitly depends on Thurston geometries. We show that shear-free solutions with perfect fluid, as well as static vacuum solutions, exist for all topologies. Moreover, we prove that, aside from non-rotationally-symmetric Bianchi II models, all BKS metrics isotropize in the presence of a positive cosmological constant, and that recollapse is never possible when the weak energy condition is satisfied. This contrasts with General Relativity (GR), where these two properties fail for Bianchi IX and KS metrics. No additional parameters compared to GR are required for these results. We discuss, in particular, how this framework might allow for simple inflationary models in any topology.

Abstract: Regular black holes offer a compelling framework to explore the consequences of resolving the central singularity of standard black holes. Using the Simpson-Visser "black-bounce" geometry as an elegant, analytically tractable framework, we explore the intricate thermodynamic behavior in such models. We demonstrate that this regular spacetime exhibits a critical instability, marked by a phase transition where the heat capacity is discontinuous. This transition signals a fundamental change in the black hole's evaporation state, which depends on the regularization parameter. Pushing beyond the semiclassical limit, we then derive the leading-order quantum corrections to the entropy via the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism. Our analysis provides a refined statistical basis for the entropy of non-singular spacetimes and offers a quantitative analysis of the nature of the black hole end-state. These results reveal that singularity resolution is not merely a geometric modification but a profound thermodynamic event, with direct implications for the stability and ultimate fate of evaporating black holes.

Motivation: 探索全息暗能量理论在不同红外截断模型和熵修正下的宇宙学行为，特别是对宇宙未来奇点性质的影响。

Method: 采用Granda-Oliveros模型定义红外截断，并在Kaniadakis统计框架下推广熵-面积关系，分析平直和弯曲宇宙中的演化方程。

Result: GO模型导致平直宇宙必然演化至大撕裂奇点；空间曲率改变膨胀速率但不消除奇点；Kaniadakis修正产生稳定de Sitter临界点并演化至小撕裂奇点。

Conclusion: 全息宇宙学的渐近命运对熵-面积关系高度敏感：GO模型预测大撕裂，而Kaniadakis修正将奇点软化为小撕裂，即使在弯曲宇宙中也是如此。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) when the infrared cutoff is defined through the Granda-Oliveros (GO) model and the entropy-area is generalized in the context of Kaniadakis statistics. For the GO model, we showed that a spatially flat universe inevitably evolves toward a big rip singularity. At the same time, the inclusion of spatial curvature modifies the expansion rate without removing the finite-time divergence: positive curvature speeds up the formation of the singularity, whereas negative curvature induces transitions between quintessence, de Sitter, and phantom-like regimes. When Kaniadakis entropy corrections are incorporated, the qualitative behavior changes substantially. The modified HDE density admits a stable de Sitter critical point and evolves toward a little rip singularity, in which the Hubble rate diverges only at infinite cosmic time. We further demonstrate that spatial curvature acts solely as a quantitative deformation in this scenario. Although it alters the detailed expansion history, it does not alter the little-rip character of the future singularity. Our results reveal that the asymptotic fate of holographic cosmologies is highly sensitive to the underlying entropy-area relation: the GO model robustly predicts a big rip. At the same time, its Kaniadakis deformation consistently softens the singularity into a little rip, even in curved universes.

Abstract: Caustics-envelopes formed by the trajectories of fluid particles-arise in proposed dynamical extensions for shell-crossing singularities occurring in the Einstein-dust system. In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{μν})$ containing a caustic $\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.

Abstract: We propose a new thermodynamic inequality for stationary and asymptotically Anti-de Sitter charged and rotating black holes, $ 4πJ^2/(3MV)<1 $. This inequality is derived through an analysis of the roots of the identity which holds among the thermodynamic variables to avoid a naked singularity. We have analyzed the Kerr-AdS black hole and the asymptotically AdS uncharged and rotating black strings and find strong supporting evidence for different horizon topologies. Using this inequality we verify the validity of reverse isoperimetric inequality in its conventional form ($ {\cal R}\geq 1 $) in the presence of rotation. By examining a wide range of black hole solutions, we confirm the validity of the proposed inequality. Assuming that reverse isoperimetric inequality continues to hold in higher dimensions, and employing the intermediate refined reverse isoperimetric inequalities introduced in [\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.241401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 131}, 241401}] as guiding principles, we extend the inequality to higher-dimensional spacetimes.

Motivation: NaI(Tl)闪烁体探测器在暗物质直接探测中至关重要，特别是DAMA/LIBRA实验观测到的年度调制信号与其他实验结果矛盾。为了准确校准核反冲信号能量，需要精确测量NaI(Tl)晶体的淬灭因子，因为核反冲和电子反冲的闪烁光产额不同。

Method: 使用上海硅酸盐研究所制造的5个超纯NaI(Tl)晶体，在美国北卡罗来纳州三角大学核实验室用准单能中子束辐照，测量5-26keV核反冲能量范围内的淬灭因子。采用两种校准方法：¹⁴¹Am源的成比例响应校准和¹³³Ba源的低能校准线。

Conclusion: NaI(Tl)晶体的淬灭因子测量存在校准方法依赖性，铊浓度对淬灭因子的影响在不同校准方案下表现不一致，这对暗物质探测实验的能量校准具有重要意义。

Abstract: Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba.

Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rmΩ$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.

TL;DR: EIC-Opticks 是一个基于 Opticks 的分支，利用事件聚合和 GPU 加速光学光子传输模拟，在 pfRICH 探测器测试中相比 Geant4 实现了一个数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在切伦科夫和闪烁探测器模拟中，光学光子传输（光线追踪）占据了大部分计算时间，而 GPU 特别适合处理这类任务。传统 CPU 模拟效率较低，需要加速方案。

Method: 开发 EIC-Opticks（基于 Opticks 的分支），利用事件聚合技术将多个事件的光子批量处理，在 GPU 上使用 NVIDIA OptiX 框架进行光学光子模拟。提供 Spack 包和 Docker 容器简化安装。

Result: 在 pfRICH 探测器测试中，EIC-Opticks 与 CPU 模拟结果高度一致。对于 5×10⁴ 个电子，相比多线程 Geant4 有一个数量级加速，相比单线程 Geant4 加速达 161±3 倍。事件聚合使每个光子模拟时间从 ~60μs 降至 ~20ns，加速约 3000 倍。

Conclusion: EIC-Opticks 通过 GPU 加速和事件聚合技术，显著提高了低到中等光子产额实验的光子传输模拟效率，为 EIC 探测器模拟提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The bulk of time spent in the simulation of Cherenkov and other scintillation detectors is spent on optical-photon transport, i.e. ray tracing, a task that GPUs are uniquely qualified to perform. We present EIC-Opticks, a fork of Opticks, which uses event aggregation to drastically accelerate photon transport simulation for low-to-moderate photon yield experiments. During the full Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of a given detector, optical photon simulation is performed on GPU(s) using the NVIDIA OptiX framework. We validate this approach using the ePIC pfRICH detector. We find GPU and CPU simulations in excellent agreement. For $5\times 10^4$ electrons with a momentum of $p=5~\mathrm{MeV}/c$ in the test case of the pfRICH detector, EIC-Opticks shows an order-of-magnitude speedup over multi-threaded Geant4, and a factor of up to 161$\pm$3 over single-threaded execution. In the case of low-to-moderate applications event aggregation reduces the per-photon simulation time from $\sim60\,μ\mathrm{s}$ for single events to $\sim20\,\mathrm{ns}$ with batching, a factor of $\sim3000$. In order to make EIC-Opticks easily installable, we authored a Spack package that makes it possible to install it with a single command. Additionally, a Docker container is provided for users with EIC-Opticks installed. EIC-Opticks provides guardrails for common pitfalls (e.g. nested volume conversion, ray tracing setting optimization).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为SALSA前端读出ASIC开发辐射容忍实现，通过冗余方法提高相干噪声抑制中值查找算法的可靠性，满足辐射环境下的应用需求。

Method: 采用TSMC 65nm工艺实现两种中值查找算法（BWMF和CSMF），并应用三种冗余技术：简单TMR、完全TMR和时间TMR（TTMR），比较它们在面积、功耗和延迟方面的表现。

Result: BWMF在简单TMR方案下在面积和功耗方面表现高效，但在更稳健的完全TMR方法下功耗显著增加。TTMR技术为CSMF提供了可靠的容错能力，同时在面积和功耗之间保持了可行的平衡。

Conclusion: TTMR技术是辐射容忍ASIC设计中的有效解决方案，能够在保持可靠容错能力的同时，在面积和功耗之间实现良好平衡，为辐射环境下的电子系统设计提供了实用参考。

Abstract: This work presents radiation-tolerant implementations for the SALSA front-end readout ASIC through redundancy methods applied to two median-finding algorithms designed for coherent noise suppression. Bit-wise Median Finder (BWMF) and Combinatorial Sum Median Finder (CSMF) were implemented in TSMC \SI{65}{\nano\meter} and evaluated in terms of area, power, and latency. Three redundancy techniques were applied in this work to compare their impact: simple TMR, full TMR, and temporal TMR (TTMR). The simple and full TMR approach was applied in both algorithms to establish comparisons and TTMR was applied to CSMF as an improvement. The results indicate that the BWMF achieves efficient performance in terms of area and power under the simple TMR scheme, but exhibits significantly higher power consumption when using the more robust full TMR approach. The TTMR technique, in turn, offers reliable fault tolerance while maintaining a feasible balance between area and power.

Abstract: We report the observation of two nuclear recoil peaks induced by neutron capture on aluminum in a cryogenic Al$_2$O$_3$ detector developed by the NUCLEUS collaboration for the detection of reactor neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CEvNS) process. Data collected at the Technical University of Munich in 2024 with a $^{252}$Cf source reveal a main recoil line at 1145 eV from single-$γ$ de-excitation of $^{28}$Al and a newly observed structure near 575 eV originating from several two-$γ$ cascades. The latter constitutes the first direct measurement of a nuclear recoil line induced by multi-$γ$ cascades. It is predicted by our simulations when the recoiling nucleus has time to stop before the emission of the next $γ$-ray in the cascade. These results demonstrate the potential performance of the CRAB (Calibration Recoil for Accurate Bolometry) method for in situ nuclear recoil calibration and highlight the importance of accurately modeling recoil stopping and nuclear de-excitation times in cryogenic detectors of CEvNS and dark matter interactions.

Abstract: Micro-pattern gas detectors (MPGDs) are widely utilized in physics experiments owing to their excellent spatial resolution and high-rate capabilities. Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种针对磁阵列型电流传感器的鲁棒自误差校正方法，即使在三相电流不平衡等相位电流相关性大幅变化时也能有效工作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当磁阵列型电流传感器应用于多芯电缆等多导体系统时，导体电流之间的时变相关性会降低多潜变量数据驱动模型的误差评估性能，特别是在相位电流相关性显著变化（如三相电流不平衡大幅波动）的情况下

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效检测低至相对误差2×10⁻³和相位误差2×10⁻³ rad的磁场传感器误差漂移，准确评估和校正每个磁场传感器的误差漂移可基本消除磁阵列型电流传感器的整体误差漂移

Conclusion: 提出的自误差校正方法在相位电流相关性显著变化的情况下仍能保持鲁棒性，验证了该方法的可行性和有效性

Abstract: Data-driven methods enable online assessment of error states in magnetic-array-type current sensors, and long-term measurement stability can be enhanced through further self-error correction. However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method.
