The new instrument implements the collinear resonance ionization spectroscopy technique for sensitive measurements of isotope shifts and hyperfine structure of short-lived isotopes produced at FRIB. The existing BECOLA beamline was extended to integrate an electrostatic ion-beam bender and an ion detector at ultra-high vacuum. An injection-seeded Ti:Sapphire laser, as well as a multi-harmonic pulsed Nd:YAG laser were installed to perform resonant excitation and selective ionization. Commissioning tests were performed to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrument by measuring the hyperfine structure of stable $^{27}$Al produced in an offline ion source. The RISE instrument is ready and operational for future studies of short-lived isotopes at FRIB."}

A single self-consistency then fixes intrinsic confinement scales: the full (linear$+$quadratic) GUP reproduces the hydrogen Bohr radius (electron) and the proton charge radius (hydrogen nucleus). The same correspondence predicts an information--controlled crossover from a short--distance complex (evanescent) regime to an emergent real (Lorentzian) regime, with a symmetry flow from complex $SU(4)$ frames to $SO(1,3)$; under scale transmutation the short--distance $SU(4)$ is repurposed as the Pati--Salam $SU(4)_c$.

While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC."}

Typically, one defaults to the Teukolsky formalism, especially when calculating extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, and uses the SN formalism when dealing with extended sources, as it offers superior convergence when employing the Green's function method for calculating the inhomogeneous solution. In this work, we present a new scheme for solving the inhomogeneous SN equation, based on integration by parts, that eliminates the extra radial integration step required in the standard formulation to construct the source term for convolution with the SN variable. Our approach enables efficient computations of gravitational waveforms within the SN formalism in all cases, from compact to extended sources. We validate our scheme and code implementation against the literature and find excellent agreement, achieving comparable performance without employing any special optimization techniques."}

For cost reduction, we then show that $^{241}$Am found in ionizing smoke detectors is spectrally suitable for Pb L-shell XRF generation and can thus replace X-ray tubes used in conventional XRF devices. Exploring soil screening as the first application, we demonstrate with Monte Carlo simulations that a configuration with 7$\\times$ $^{241}$Am sources and a standard silicon drift detector can enable screening-relevant detection limits (100 ppm Pb) in soil within practical measurement times (<30 min).

These systems possess long lived quasinormal modes with extremely small imaginary parts, originating from the effective cavity between the photon sphere and the object's interior. We show that the excitation of such modes is strongly suppressed, scaling with the imaginary part of their frequency, and therefore they contribute to the waveform only at very late times. This hierarchy naturally explains the structure of echo signals: the prompt ringdown is dominated by standard light ring modes, the early echoes arise from moderately damped cavity modes, and only the latest echoes are governed by long lived modes. Based on this, we propose a practical ringdown waveform model based on a superposition of ordinary black hole quasinormal modes and cavity modes, which captures the complexity of the ringdown of horizonless ultracompact objects. We further demonstrate that the combination of small excitation factors and weak damping enhances the robustness of long lived modes against localized perturbations, in contrast to the spectral instabilities affecting standard black hole quasinormal modes. Finally, we extend the analysis of greybody factors to exotic compact objects and wormholes, showing that they remain stable under small deformations of the effective potential and thus represent robust observables. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding excitation, stability, and echoes in ultracompact horizonless objects, with direct implications for their spectral properties and gravitational wave signatures."}

In this work, we demonstrate a scalable, low-damage method to integrate high-quality polycrystalline diamond films on (010) $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), enabled by dielectric interlayers and polymer-assisted electrostatic nanodiamond seeding. A systematic investigation of processing conditions was conducted to assess their effects on film morphology, grain evolution, sp3-phase purity, and optical characteristics. Diamond films grown at 800 degC exhibit grain sizes up to 126.6 nm, RMS roughness of 16.3 nm, and a sharp diamond Raman peak at around 1332 cm-1 with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 34.98 cm-1. The corresponding sp$^3$-phase purity exceeds 97.5 percent, with an optical bandgap up to 5.13 eV. Deposition time variation from 10 to 60 minutes at 800 degC results in thicknesses from 53 nm to 315 nm and corresponding grain coarsening. Interlayer comparison reveals that SiO2 yields slightly larger grains and higher purity than SiNx under identical conditions. Notably, films with more than 96 percent sp$^3$ content were achieved at temperatures as low as 480 degC, confirming the compatibility of this approach with reduced thermal budgets.

This is essential for achieving precise three-dimensional tracking of the interaction products and enabling accurate particle-flow reconstruction. Organic scintillator detectors, for example, in the form of scintillating fibres, offer sub-millimetre spatial and sub-nanosecond temporal resolution. However, such systems introduce significant challenges in construction and demand a large number of readout electronics channels, leading to extremely high costs that are difficult to mitigate. In this article, we propose a paradigm shift in the detection of elementary particles that leads to ultrafast three-dimensional high-resolution imaging in large volumes of unsegmented scintillator. The key enabling technologies are plenoptic systems and time-resolving single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array imaging sensors. Together, they allow us, for the first time ever with a plenoptic camera, the reconstruction of the origin of single photons in the scintillator, thereby facilitating an event-by-event analysis. A case study focused on neutrino detection demonstrates the unique potential of this approach, achieving full event reconstruction with a spatial resolution on the order of two hundred micrometres. This work paves the way for a new class of particle scintillator-based detectors, whose capabilities should be further enhanced through future developments and expanded to Cherenkov light detection and calorimetry at collider neutrino experiments, searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, as well as applications such as medical imaging and fast neutron detection."}

Central to our approach is the notion of a cline in the complex plane, which organizes singular points of the differential equations and remain invariant under Möbius transformations. Building on the cline structure we identified in black hole horizons, we carry out a systematic reduction and relocation of poles in the differential equation to obtain explicit representations of the solutions. We illustrate our approach by extracting the scalar perturbation solutions for the 7-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole and deriving the static scalar tidal Love numbers. These results suggest that clines expose a Möbius-invariant order within black hole perturbations, rendering black hole perturbation problems remarkably tractable."}

In transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), an emerging class of 2D semiconductors, we show that mobility modulation under biaxial strain is dictated by changes in inter-valley scattering rather than effective mass renormalization as in bulk silicon. Using a multiscale full-band transport framework that incorporates both intrinsic phonon, extrinsic impurity, and dielectric scattering, we find that tensile strain enhances n-type mobility through K-Q valley separation, while compressive strain improves p-type mobility via Γ-K decoupling. The tuning rates calculated from our full-band model far exceed those achieved by strain engineering in silicon. Both relaxed and strain-modulated carrier mobilities align quantitatively with experimentally verified measurements and are valid across a wide range of practical FET configurations. The enhancement remains robust across variations in temperature, carrier density, impurity level, and dielectric environment. Our results highlight the pivotal role of strain in improving the reliability and performance of 2D TMD-based electronics."}

This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency.

In this study, we systematically model the linear energy transfer (LET) spectra of GCRs and the corresponding radiation quality factor, <Q>, in deep space and shielding environments. The Badhwar-O'Neill 2020 (BON20) model is used to represent GCR fluxes under different solar modulation potentials (phi), which characterize the level of solar activity. GCR interactions with spherical shielding of different thicknesses are simulated to obtain the LET spectra, absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and <Q>. We present a comprehensive dataset of these quantities for a range of phi values and shielding thicknesses. The results show that <Q> depends strongly on the shielding thickness but only weakly on solar activity. Furthermore, model predictions are validated against long-term measurements from the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) orbiting the Moon, and the Liulin-MO detector on board the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) orbiting Mars. In this comparison, we consider factors for anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) contributions and radial gradients of both GCRs and ACRs, applying scaling factors of 6.3% at 1 AU and 11.0% at 1.5 AU to the calculated absorbed dose rate. With these corrections, the modeled absorbed dose rate and <Q> exhibit consistent temporal variations with the observations under both thin and thick shielding conditions. Moreover, we investigate the distinct temporal evolution of <Q> for light and heavy GCR nuclei, revealing how solar modulation influences the elemental radiation quality factor across GCR species. These results offer new insights into the temporal and environmental dependence of the space radiation quality factor, with implications for radiation dose estimate and crewed mission design."}

The target nanowire is illuminated via the fiber, and the local absorption of light heats the wire, causing a change in its resistivity. Scanning the fiber over the nanowire, the change in its resistivity is monitored by lock-in amplifier, mapping the spatial photothermal response correlated to absorption and coupling efficiency. The maximum of the response corresponds to optimal fiber-SNSPD alignment. This method allows for aligning the fiber to the center of the meander with sub-micron precision. The response is robust to variations in the angle and height of the fiber, providing an alternative or complement to fiber-to-chip alignment methods based on the back-reflection or transmission measurement."}

The finite element calculation is done in Schwarzschild coordinates, following a large and scalable number of mass elements in interaction with each other through elastic forces derived from a potential energy function and with the spacetime geometry. After the fact, we analyze the dynamics using a local Fermi coordinate system, computing (1) the deviation of the center of mass of the body relative to the initial marginally-bound orbit, (2) changes in orbital and spin angular momenta, and (3) the decrease in orbital energy and accompanying deposition of energy into internal elastic dynamics.

NEW-MUSIC will cover 80-420 GHz, split into six spectral bands, with polarimetry. This broad spectral coverage will enable study of a range of scientific topics such as the accretion and feedback in galaxies and galaxy cluster evolution via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, the transient synchrotron emission from the explosive deaths of massive stars and other time-domain phenomena, and dusty sources from low to high redshift (with polarization). Al KIDs have already been demonstrated for bands 2-5. AlMn KIDs will be used for the 90~GHz band, as Al's pair-breaking energy is too high. However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn. Then, we tested the addition of a gap smearing parameter, a standard extension to BCS theory in use for high kinetic inductance materials, and found it did not improve the fits."}

One standard way to achieve super-resolution is by structuring the phase of the field illuminating the object. Although super-resolution techniques are already employed in commercial imaging devices, intense research efforts continue to enhance the resolution even further. In this work, we show that if the field illuminating the object is structured in the azimuthal coordinate--such as a field carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM)--the azimuthal features of the object can be imaged with enhanced imaging resolution. We experimentally demonstrate it with two objects, namely, an azimuthal double-slit and a Siemens star. We find that for a given azimuthal feature, there is an optimum OAM mode index of the illumination that gives the best imaging resolution. Super-resolution imaging of azimuthal feature can have important implications, especially for some biological objects that are known to have predominantly azimuthal features."}

The analysis of timelike geodesics leads to the same condition, reinforcing that the generalized Vaidya geometry with $\\partial m / \\partial r \\neq 0$ cannot represent a consistent stellar interior bounded by a regular surface.

We formulate the slow-roll dynamics and derive analytical predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in both linear and nonlinear non-minimal coupling models, assuming a power-law inflaton potential.

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations."}

A set of elliptic equations with prescribed Dirichlet boundary conditions at the horizons and at spatial infinity is established for constructing the initial data. To explore the dynamics encoded in these initial data, we consider the conformally flat three-metric case and numerically evolve it using the BSSN code for two co-rotating and counter-rotating black holes with angular velocities prescribed at the horizons. When the angular velocities are non-uniform and deviate from a constant value at the horizons, new gravitational waveforms are generated which display certain oscillatory pattern reminiscent of that of quasi-normal ringing in the inspiral phase before merger takes place."}

The scattering coefficients, greybody factors, and Wigner time delay are computed explicitly. We consider both small and large black holes, with black-hole to cosmological horizon radii parametrically small and of order unity, respectively. This extends previous studies confined to the small black-hole regime only. In addition, for small black holes we perform a calculation that remains agnostic about the relative size between the ratio of the geometry's horizons and the scalar's frequency in units of the black-hole radius. When the two are comparable, we find that they are interchangeable in the greybody factor, which is symmetric under $ω\\leftrightarrow 1/r_c$ (where $ω$ is the scalar's frequency and $r_c$ the cosmological horizon radius)."}

Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas. The polarimeter module design was validated during an ESRF beam test campaign in 2023.

In response to this challenge, proposals to test quantum entanglement induced by Newtonian gravity in table-top experiments have attracted significant attention as a potentially feasible approach far below the Planck energy scale. In this work, we propose a scheme to amplify gravity-induced entanglement between two masses using parametric resonance. Specifically, we consider two parametrically resonant oscillators interacting through Newtonian gravity, each governed by the Mathieu equation. We analyzed the logarithmic negativity between two oscillators and investigate the effects of random force noise and linear damping.

Motivated by this success, we consider an extended framework -- the hybrid metric-Palatini scalar-tensor (HMPST) theory -- in which an additional scalar field $φ$ modulates the curvature couplings, enriching the dynamics and enabling nontrivial self-interactions through scalar potentials. We focus on the analytically tractable linear-$f(\\hat{R})$ subclass and study its cosmological, strong-field, and weak-field regimes. In homogeneous and isotropic settings, we identify de Sitter and matter-dominated cosmological solutions describing accelerated expansion and early-universe behavior. For static, spherically symmetric configurations, the field equations yield analytic solutions generalizing the Janis-Newman-Winicour and Buchdahl metrics, including the Schwarzschild-de Sitter limit. In the weak-field regime, linearized perturbations around Minkowski space lead to Yukawa-type corrections to the gravitational potential, with an effective Newton constant $G_{\\rm eff}$ and post-Newtonian parameter $γ$ that recover General Relativity for heavy or weakly coupled scalars.

In flat spacetime, it was believed that the images of the emission sources in these two cases are equivalent due to the relativity of motion. Our simulation demonstrates that although both cases remain apparent shape of the sphere, the apparent distortions of the images are different, and case ii) violates conformality on the observer's celestial sphere. Furthermore, we extended similar situations to a black hole spacetime. For case i), it is found that the conformal transformation induced by the aberration effect also holds in black hole spacetime, and is not restricted to observers in geodesic motion. For case ii), we study the slow-light effect on the moving sources, and show that the gravity introduces additional influence on the snapshots of a moving source."}

Mapping Dust and Molecular Gas in the Sgr A Molecular Cloud Complex at the Galactic Center", "comment": "17 pages + 5 pages of bibliography and appendices. 14 figures, 3 tables. To be submitted to ApJ", "summary": "We present the processing of an observation of Sagittarius A (Sgr A) with the Tomographic Ionized-carbon Mapping Experiment (TIME), part of the 2021-2022 commissioning run to verify TIME's hyperspectral imaging capabilities for future line-intensity mapping. Using an observation of Jupiter to calibrate detector gains and pointing offsets, we process the Sgr A observation in a purpose-built pipeline that removes correlated noise through common-mode subtraction with correlation-weighted scaling, and uses map-domain principal component analysis to identify further systematic errors. The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds. Broadband continuum flux comparisons with the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) show agreement to within $\\sim$5% in high-SNR molecular clouds in the Sgr A region. From the CO line detections, we estimate a molecular hydrogen mass of between $5.4 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ and $5.7 \\times 10^5 M_\\odot$, consistent with prior studies. These results demonstrate TIME's ability to recover both continuum and spectral-line signals in complex Galactic fields, validating its readiness for upcoming extragalactic CO and [C II] surveys."}

The MOG parameter $α$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $α$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $χ_{\\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\\angleβ_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $α$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime."}

While liquid argon and liquid xenon TPCs have been extensively employed in the field of direct dark matter detection, successful development of LHe TPCs has not yet been achieved. Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation. We will demonstrate that this overlap can be entirely mitigated when the LHe temperature is maintained near 1.0 K. At this temperature, electron mobility is three orders of magnitude higher than at approximately 4.0 K, which is the temperature we initially proposed for the LHe TPC."}

We derive and analyze the black hole's thermodynamic functions, showing that they depend critically on the noncommutativity parameter denoted as Θ, while still satisfying the first law of thermodynamics. Stability analysis reveals that the noncommutative Schwarzschild-AdS black hole undergoes a phase transition at a critical point. Moreover, the thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of a van der Waals fluid, with the noncommutativity introducing a correction term to the black hole's surface temperature. Our results indicate that the noncommutativity parameter Θ is of the order of the Planck scale and functions as a novel thermodynamic variable within the system."}

Applying a quasi-local prescription for the pressure anisotropy, we derive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and integrate them numerically over a large parameter space in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $α$ and the degree of anisotropy $β$. We provide mass-radius sequences, mass-compactness, energy density, and pressure profiles, and perform a full stability analysis based on the turning-point criterion, the radial adiabatic index $γ_r$, and the radial and transverse sound speeds $v_r^2$ and $v_t^2$. Our results show that positive $α$ and positive anisotropy $(β> 0)$ systematically increase the maximum mass and radius, enabling then configurations that exceed $2\\,M_\\odot$ while still obeying causality and the modified Buchdahl bound in 4DEGB gravity. A comparison with the latest astrophysical constraints (NICER, GW170817, GW190814, and massive-pulsar measurements) identifies regions of the $(α,β)$ parameter space that are observationally allowable. In conclusion, anisotropic dark-energy stars in 4DEGB gravity provide viable, observationally testable ultra-compact alternatives to normal neutron stars and black holes, and also potentially open rich avenues for further multi-messenger searches for higher-curvature effects."}

We find that for sufficiently large values of $|Λ|$ these black holes are generically asymptotically (A)dS and form a three-parameter family of black holes, with free parameters being the horizon radius, $Λ$, and Bach parameter $b$. For smaller values of $|Λ|$, fine-tuning of the Bach parameter is necessary to recover asymptotically (A)dS behaviour, resulting in two distinct two-parameter families of spherically symmetric black holes with (A)dS asymptotics. One family is the (A)dS-Schwarzschild solution, the other is a fine-tuned asymtotically (A)dS-Schwarzschild-Bach solution. We also generalise the above solutions to electrically charged black holes, obtaining qualitatively similar asymptotic behaviour. This adds the electric charge as an additional free parameter of these black holes. Both fine-tuned three-parameter families are distinct from Reissner-Nordström black holes."}
