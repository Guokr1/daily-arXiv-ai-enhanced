The technique is based on the\ndetermination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a\npreliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary\npolychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number\nof coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different\ncombinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing\nprobabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response\nmatrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra\nacquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator\nelectronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The\ntechnique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector\nand with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick\nsilicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the\nreconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3\noffline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute\npercentage errors.

However, this requires mechanistic 4D\nobservations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we\ndemonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined\nwith Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both\nparticle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging\nimage analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its\nformation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite\nparticle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon\nclusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all\nhave a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility\n- but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify\nfast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic\ndepth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion\nlimitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery\nperformance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of\ninfluence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials\nand electrode manufacturing."}

However, contrary to what was commonly\nassumed for many decades, quantum gravity effects could manifest in scales much\nlarger than the Planck Scale, provided that there is enough coherence in the\nsuperposition of geometries. Quantum Clocks, i.e. quantum mechanical systems\nwhose internal dynamics can keep track of proper-time lapses, are a very\npromising tool for probing such low-energy quantum gravity effects. In this\nwork, we contribute to this subject by proposing a spacetime-covariant\nformalism to describe clocks in first quantization. In particular, we account\nfor the possibility of dynamically accelerated clocks via suitable couplings\nwith external fields. We find that a particular decomposition of the\n(quadratic) clock Hamiltonian into positive- and negative-mass sectors, when\nattainable, enables one to compute the evolution of the system directly in\nterms of the clock's proper-time while maintaining explicit covariance. When\nthis decomposition is possible, the evolution obtained is always unitary, even\nwith couplings with external fields used to, e.g., accelerate the clocks. We\nthen apply this formulation to compute the joint time evolution of a pair of\nquantum clocks in two cases: (i) inertial clocks with relative motion and (ii)\ncharged clocks accelerated by a uniform magnetic field. In both cases, when our\nclocks are prepared in coherent states, we find that the density matrix\n$\\rho_{\\tau_2|\\tau_1}$ describing time-measurements of the two clocks yields\nnot only conditional probabilities whose peaks match exactly the classical\nexpected values for time dilation, but also yields coherent quantum\nfluctuations around that peak with a Gaussian profile."}

For both signs of the IR/UV-mixing correction term we establish\nbounds on the characteristic length scale which reach the Planck-length\nmilestone.
