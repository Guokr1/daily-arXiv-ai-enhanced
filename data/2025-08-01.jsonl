Probabilistic cataloging\nsolves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional\nnature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to\nscale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a\nfixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions\non some of the priors.

The microscopic origin of these axions\nis diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and\ncompactification axions in string theory, to \\cm contorted geometries\nexemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan\ntheory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons\n(CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a\nKerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance\nand the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The\nspecific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are\nmassive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a\nTakagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it\nis shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity\n(GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to\nthe CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the\naxionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through\nthe average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be\nproduced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the\nstructure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a\nleft-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the\nanomalous CS effects produce the entanglement."}

To this end, we\nfirst outline the basic idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general\nrequirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of\nPenrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally\nanalytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss the characteristics\nand properties corresponding to this particular Penrose diagram. As an\napplication, we work out the differences between the spacetime and null\nvariants of the canonical advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate\nrepresentations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime by explicitly\nconstructing and visually analyzing Penrose diagrams equipped with foliations\nof the level sets of the respective Eddington-Finkelstein time and null\ncoordinates. Throughout the course of the paper, we provide brief accounts of\nthe relevant parts of the seminal publications on the exterior Schwarzschild\nsolution by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and\nPenrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate\nstudents in physics and applied mathematics (with a background in general\nrelativity and differential geometry), serving mainly as an introduction to\nPenrose diagrams and coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild\nspacetime."}

Recent analyses have found\nconflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin,\nbut the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\nanalyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In\nthis work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to\ndemonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning\npopulations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude\npopulation model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the\nbinary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin\nmagnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual\nsystems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given\nbinary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin\nmagnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations\nof the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but\ncould be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary\nor a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources."}

We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the\nPoincar\\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the\nLorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of\nTrautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we\nset to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem\nof a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it\nshould be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is\npotentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the\nother hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only\nabsolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we\nrecover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR."}

To be submitted to PRD. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary\nneutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope\nof the symmetry energy $L_{\\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of\nequations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density\nfunctional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of\n$L_{\\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a\nset of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of\nstate at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with\nsubsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related\nstructural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with\ntheoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves\nare unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we\nfind that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations,\nwhich employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our\nextracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find\nthat they are distinct for the different $L_{\\rm sym}$, especially at lower\nmass numbers $A \\lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts\nare more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\\rm\nsym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the\nejecta properties and the kilonova signal."}
