### [1] [mcdust: A 2D Monte Carlo code for dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21239)
*Vignesh Vaikundaraman,Nerea Gurrutxaga,Joanna Drążkowska*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: mcdust是一个用于模拟原行星盘中尘埃演化的并行代码，采用FORTRAN90编写，支持OpenMP并行化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究尘埃在原行星盘中的碰撞演化和传输过程。

Method: 使用代表性粒子方法跟踪有限数量的粒子，结合静态幂律气体盘和自适应网格技术。

Result: 代码能够高效模拟尘埃在二维（r-z）空间中的碰撞和生长过程。

Conclusion: mcdust为研究原行星盘中尘埃演化提供了高效的计算工具。

Abstract: mcdust is a parallel simulation code for dust evolution in protoplanetary
disks. The code is written in FORTRAN90 and parallelised with OpenMP. The code
models dust collisional evolution and transport in the vertical and radial
directions. The currently included collisional outcomes are dust growth by
sticking, fragmentation of dust particles and erosion, where a small particle
chips a portion of the large particle. We employ a representative particle
approach to track a limited number of particles instead of tracking every
particle, saving computational time. We have a static power-law gas disk with
temperature assumed to be vertically isothermal. Dust coagulation depends on
the local gas properties, and therefore, we bin particles into grids and
perform collisions. We make use of an adaptive grid approach where we make sure
that each cell has an equal number of representative particles. This guarantees
that there are always sufficient particles to resolve the physics of
collisions. The code resolves dust coagulation in 2D(r-z). To access the
documentation of the code, see https://mcdust.readthedocs.io/ .

### [2] [Generative imaging for radio interferometry with fast uncertainty quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21270)
*Matthijs Mars,Tobías I. Liaudat,Jessica J. Whitney,Marta M. Betcke,Jason D. McEwen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的高效图像重建方法RI-GAN，用于射电望远镜数据，支持不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型射电干涉望远镜（如SKA）的发展，现有重建方法（如CLEAN算法）计算量大且缺乏不确定性量化，需要更高效且可靠的技术。

Method: RI-GAN结合了条件生成对抗网络（rcGAN）和梯度U-Net（GU-Net）架构，通过Wasserstein GAN提升训练稳定性，并引入正则化项防止模式崩溃。输入为脏图像和点扩散函数（PSF），输出高质量重建图像。

Result: RI-GAN能高效生成高质量重建图像，适应不同可见度覆盖范围，支持动态范围扩展，并提供不确定性量化。

Conclusion: RI-GAN为下一代射电望远镜提供了计算高效、可扩展且支持不确定性量化的成像方法。

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

### [3] [Benchmarking of Geant4 simulations for the COSI Anticoincidence System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21275)

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文介绍了为NASA小型探测器任务COSI设计的反符合系统（ACS）的性能建模方法，通过Geant4模拟和实验测量验证了模拟的准确性，并开发了校正矩阵以提高探测效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确模拟ACS的性能以降低背景噪声并提高瞬态事件检测能力，同时优化探测器的能量分辨率和光收集效率。

Method: 使用Geant4模拟结合光学物理，通过实验室测量验证模拟结果，并开发校正矩阵以修正光收集效率和能量分辨率。

Conclusion: 验证的模拟方法和校正矩阵为COSI任务提供了可靠的ACS性能模型，优化了探测器的整体性能。

Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer
satellite mission, designed for all-sky observations in the soft gamma-ray
domain with the use of germanium detectors (GeDs). An active Anticoincidence
System (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background
and contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the
ACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes
within the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We
have encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated
Geant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose,
we use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS
lateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters,
including the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate
that the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light
collection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20%
and 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the
correction matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection
efficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The
gamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the
inclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\sim$8% close to the SiPMs
and suppressed by $\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average
value. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom
ACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral
walls.

### [4] [How many pixels are there in a polarized pulsar timing array map?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21380)
*Dylan L. Jow,Anna Tsai,Ue-Li Pen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的二次估计器，用于构建引力波在天空中的分布图，能够探测引力波的偏振状态，并分析了其分辨率和灵敏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Hellings和Downs（HD）曲线方法无法提供引力波的方向信息和偏振状态，因此需要一种新方法来弥补这些不足。

Method: 使用二次估计器构建引力波的偏振分布图，描述其在天空中的状态空间和偏振的Poincaré球。

Result: 研究发现，偏振天空图的分辨率有限，约为32个独立像素，对应58度的角分辨率，且需要至少20颗脉冲星。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能提供与HD方法相当的方差，还能显著提高单点源的探测显著性。

Abstract: The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in
pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and
Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a
function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this
approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of
nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any
directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the
gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the
gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple
quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction
on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this
way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized
gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\'e sphere
describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what
is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent
pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct
gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the
answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where
16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct
polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$,
which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$
pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD
significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal
corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.

### [5] [Evaluation of gamma-ray response of the AstroPix4 HV-CMOS active pixel sensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21618)
*Yusuke Suda,Regina Caputo,Daniel Violette,Grant Sommer,Nicolas Striebig,Manoj Jadhav,Yasushi Fukazawa,Carolyn Kierans,Richard Leys,Jessica Metcalfe,Norito Nakano,Ivan Perić,Jeremy S. Perkins,Hiroyasu Tajima*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: AstroPix4是一种新型高压CMOS有源像素传感器，用于下一代伽马射线太空望远镜AMEGO-X。其目标是实现500微米厚、500微米间距像素的全耗尽，探测25-700 keV伽马射线，122 keV能量分辨率<10%，功耗<1.5 mW/cm²。AstroPix4功耗降至2 mW/cm²，输入电容降低，可探测14 keV光峰，122 keV能量分辨率为14%。动态范围为14 keV至250 keV，耗尽层深度约90微米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发满足AMEGO-X仪器要求的高性能传感器，包括高灵敏度、低功耗和良好的能量分辨率。

Method: 采用16×13阵列的500微米间距像素设计，优化输入电容和功耗。

Result: 功耗降至2 mW/cm²，可探测14 keV光峰，122 keV能量分辨率为14%，动态范围14-250 keV，耗尽层深度约90微米。

Conclusion: AstroPix4在功耗和性能上有所改进，但仍需进一步优化以满足AMEGO-X的严格需求。

Abstract: AstroPix is a novel high-voltage CMOS active pixel sensor being developed for
a next generation gamma-ray space telescope, AMEGO-X. To meet AMEGO-X
instrument requirements, AstroPix must achieve full depletion of its
$500~\rm{\mu m}$ thick, $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. It must be sensitive to
gamma rays in the range of $25-700$ keV, with the energy resolution at 122 keV
of $<10$%. Furthermore, given the space-based nature of AMEGO-X, the power
consumption of AstroPix needs to be lower than $1.5~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$. We report
the gamma-ray response of the latest version of AstroPix, AstroPix4. The chip
contains $16\times 13$ array of $500~\rm{\mu m}$-pitch pixels. The power
consumption is estimated to be about $2~\rm{mW/{cm}^2}$, which is approximately
half the power of the previous AstroPix version. The input capacitance is
reduced, allowing for the detection of the 14 keV photopeak from $\rm{^{57}Co}$
and a moderate energy resolution of 14% at 122 keV. The dynamic range is
estimated to be in the range from 14 keV to $\sim250$ keV. We found that the
sensor depletion layer expands as expected and the measured depletion depth is
approximately $90~\rm{\mu m}$ when biased at $-240$ V.

### [6] [Probabilistic cosmological inference on HI tomographic data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21682)
*Sambatra Andrianomena*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从21厘米层析数据中提取宇宙学信息的方法，通过深度学习编码器和无似然推断实现高精度约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用21厘米层析数据在中等红移下提取宇宙学信息，以弥补传统方法的不足。

Method: 使用三维卷积层编码器将中性氢3D数据降维到潜在空间，再通过掩码自回归流进行无似然推断，估计宇宙学参数。

Result: 编码器学习的潜在空间表示可分，神经网络密度估计器能高精度约束宇宙学参数（R²≥0.91），且后验不确定性校准合理。

Conclusion: 该方法在分析未来21厘米数据时具有潜力，潜在空间表示和密度估计器表现出强大的预测能力。

Abstract: We explore the possibility of retrieving cosmological information from 21-cm
tomographic data at intermediate redshift. The first step in our approach
consists of training an encoder, composed of several three dimensional
convolutional layers, to cast the neutral hydrogen 3D data into a lower
dimension latent space. Once pre-trained, the featurizer is able to generate 3D
grid representations which, in turn, will be mapped onto cosmology
($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_{8}$) via likelihood-free inference. For the latter,
which is framed as a density estimation problem, we consider a Bayesian
approximation method which exploits the capacity of Masked Autoregressive Flow
to estimate the posterior. It is found that the representations learned by the
deep encoder are separable in latent space. Results show that the neural
density estimator, trained on the latent codes, is able to constrain cosmology
with a precision of $R^2 \ge 0.91$ on all parameters and that most of the
ground truth of the instances in the test set fall within $1\sigma$
uncertainty. It is established that the posterior uncertainty from the density
estimator is reasonably calibrated. We also investigate the robustness of the
feature extractor by using it to compress out-of-distribution dataset, that is
either from a different simulation or from the same simulation but at different
redshift. We find that, while trained on the latent codes corresponding to
different types of out-of-distribution dataset, the probabilistic model is
still reasonably capable of constraining cosmology, with $R^2 \ge 0.80$ in
general. This highlights both the predictive power of the density estimator
considered in this work and the meaningfulness of the latent codes retrieved by
the encoder. We believe that the approach prescribed in this proof of concept
will be of great use when analyzing 21-cm data from various surveys in the near
future.

### [7] [Nighttime Cloud Detection, Tracking and Prediction with All-Sky Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21711)
*Sebastian Buntin,Chris M. Copperwheat,Helen E. Jermak*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全天空相机的实时夜间云检测、跟踪和预测方法，旨在提高地面机器人望远镜的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面望远镜易受恶劣天气（尤其是云层）影响，导致观测时间损失和潜在损坏。现有云检测方法在变化光照条件下（如月相）准确性不足。

Method: 利用全天空相机图像序列的时间非相干性，通过差分图像突出移动云结构，应用Otsu阈值生成二值云图，并利用数学形态学技术减少噪声。

Result: 系统实现了可靠的云检测和跟踪，预测未来15分钟的云运动，误报率和漏报率均约为1%。

Conclusion: 该系统通过改进云预测和观测调度，显著提升了机器人望远镜的操作可靠性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for real-time nighttime cloud detection,
tracking, and prediction using all-sky cameras, aimed at enhancing the
efficiency of ground-based robotic telescopes. Ground-based telescopes are
vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, particularly cloud cover, which can
lead to the loss of valuable observation time and potential damage to the
telescope. Existing methods for cloud detection have limitations in accuracy,
particularly under varying illumination conditions such as gibbous moon phases.
To address these challenges, we developed an algorithm that uses the temporal
incoherence of image sequences from all-sky cameras. The method computes
difference images to highlight moving cloud structures, applies Otsu
thresholding to generate binary cloud maps, and uses mathematical morphology
techniques to reduce noise from bright stars and other artifacts. Segmented
cloud regions are then tracked across successive frames, allowing estimation of
a velocity vector and enabling short-term predictions of cloud movement. Our
approach achieves reliable cloud detection and tracking, providing predictions
up to 15 minutes into the future - a capability critical for robotic telescopes
that rely on look-ahead scheduling. The system was validated against extensive
historical data from the Liverpool Telescope's Skycam A and T systems,
achieving a false positive rate of approximately 1% and a similar false
negative rate, depending on cloud thickness and speed. By improving cloud
forecasting and observational scheduling, the system offers a valuable tool for
enhancing the operational reliability of robotic telescopes.

Abstract: The Near-InfraRed Planet Searcher (NIRPS) is a high-resolution,
high-stability near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph equipped with an AO system.
Installed on the ESO 3.6-m telescope, it was developed to enable radial
velocity (RV) measurements of low-mass exoplanets around M dwarfs and to
characterise exoplanet atmospheres in the NIR. This paper provides a
comprehensive design overview and characterisation of the NIRPS instrument,
reporting on its on-sky performance, and presenting its GTO programme. The
instrument started its operations on 1 Apr 2023 after intensive on-sky testing
phases. The spectral range continuously covers the Y, J, and H bands from 972.4
to 1919.6 nm. The thermal control system maintains 1 mK stability over several
months. The NIRPS AO-assisted fibre link improves coupling efficiency and
offers a unique high-angular resolution capability with a fibre acceptance of
only 0.4 arcsec. A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is
provided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top
of the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent. The RV precision,
measured on the bright star Proxima with a known exoplanetary system, is 77
cm/s. NIRPS and HARPS can be used simultaneously, offering unprecedented
spectral coverage for spectroscopic characterisation and stellar activity
mitigation. Modal noise can be aptly mitigated by the implementation of fibre
stretchers and AO scanning mode. Initial results confirm that NIRPS opens new
possibilities for RV measurements, stellar characterisation, and exoplanet
atmosphere studies with high precision and high spectral fidelity. NIRPS
demonstrated stable RV precision at the level of 1 m/s over several weeks. The
instrument high throughput offers a notable improvement over previous
spectrographs, enhancing our ability to detect small exoplanets.

Motivation: 传统OECTs制造依赖洁净室工艺和贵金属接触，成本高且不环保。本研究旨在开发一种可持续、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 结合挤出打印石墨烯墨水、旋涂醋酸纤维素墨水以及飞秒激光烧蚀技术，实现微米级分辨率的自由站立OECTs制造。

Result: 成功制造出通道开口低至1微米、方块电阻低于10欧姆/平方的OECTs，并展示了多种器件结构。设备在360°C以下可降解80%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为可持续有机电子器件提供了一种快速原型设计途径，兼具材料循环性、工艺简单性和架构多样性。

Abstract: Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are key bioelectronic devices,
with applications in neuromorphics, sensing, and flexible electronics. However,
their microfabrication typically relies on precious metal contacts manufactured
via cleanroom processes. Here, we present a high-throughput
additive-subtractive microfabrication strategy for metal-free, flexible OECTs
using biodegradable materials and room-temperature processing. Additive
manufacturing of large features is achieved via extrusion printing of a
water-dispersed graphene ink to fabricate electrode contacts, and spin-coating
of a cellulose acetate ink to form both the substrate and encapsulation layer.
Combined with femtosecond laser ablation, this approach enables
micrometer-resolution patterning of free-standing OECTs with channel openings
down to 1 um and sheet resistance below 10 Ohm/sq. By tuning laser parameters,
we demonstrate both selective and simultaneous ablation strategies, enabling
the fabrication horizontal, vertical, and planar-gated OECTs, as well as
complementary NOT gate inverters. Thermal degradation studies in air show that
over 80% of the device mass decomposes below 360 deg C, providing a low-energy
route for device disposal and addressing the environmental impact of electronic
waste. This approach offers a cleanroom-free and lithography-free pathway
toward the rapid prototyping of high-resolution, sustainable organic
electronics, combining material circularity, process simplicity, and
architectural versatility for next-generation bioelectronic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨刚性弹性杆在膨胀宇宙中的动力学行为，验证小束缚系统是否遵循哈勃流。

Method: 通过初始边界值问题（IBVP）分析非线性波动方程的解，参数κ与杆长和宇宙尺度比相关。

Result: 小κ值时解全局有界，杆长振荡；大κ值时解在有限时间内爆炸，杆被无限拉伸。

Conclusion: 小束缚系统不遵循哈勃流，大系统可能遵循，类似结论适用于星系束缚问题。

Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid elastic rod, initially set in its relaxed
state along a spacelike geodesic, in an expanding
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This leads to an initial
boundary value problem (IBVP) for a nonlinear wave equation whose nonlinearity
depends on a parameter $\kappa \geq 0$, related to the ratio between the rod's
length and the cosmological scale. We show that if $\kappa$ is small enough
then the solution to the IBVP is global in time and bounded, meaning that the
rod's length oscillates around its initial value. For greater values of
$\kappa$, however, the solution to the IBVP blows up in finite coordinate time,
indicating that the rod is infinitely stretched by the cosmological expansion.
This supports the widely held belief that sufficiently small bound systems do
not follow the Hubble flow, whereas larger systems may do so. Similar
conclusions apply to the tethered galaxy version of this problem, where the rod
is used to connect two point masses (which results in nonlinear boundary
conditions for the IBVP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决在具有扭转奇点的时空中如何定义和测量锥形缺陷的问题，特别是在Taub-NUT时空中。

Method: 提出了一种几何定义，将标准锥度概念推广到具有扭转奇点的静态轴对称时空，并指出锥形缺陷依赖于观察者的选择。

Result: 研究发现，锥形缺陷是观察者依赖的，且在某些观察者视角下，锥形缺陷可能消失。这挑战了传统将锥度差异视为轴向上弦/杆诱导加速度指标的观点。

Conclusion: 结论指出，在具有非零NUT参数的时空中，存在观察者感知不到锥形缺陷，且试图定义规范观察者会导致更不理想的锥度定义。

Abstract: We discuss the issue of defining and measuring conical deficits (conicity) in
spacetimes with the torsion singularity such as the Misner string in Taub--NUT
spacetime. We propose a geometric definition that generalizes the standard
notion of conicity to stationary axially symmetric spacetimes with torsion
singularity, where the conical deficit becomes observer-dependent -- it depends
on the choice of a timelike Killing vector. This implies the existence of
observers who perceive no conical singularity along the symmetry axis. As a
result, in any spacetime with a non-vanishing NUT parameter, there are
observers for whom the conicity has the same value on both semi-axes. This
challenges the usual interpretation of conicity differences as indicators of
string/rod-induced acceleration along the axis. We illustrate our definition
across the full Pleba\'nski--Demia\'nski class, including the recently
identified accelerated Taub--NUT solution. Our attempts in determining a
canonical observer lead to even less desirable definitions of conicity.

Abstract: In the current study, we present the observational data constraints on the
parameters space for an anisotropic cosmological model of Bianchi I type
spacetime in general relativity (GR). For the analysis, we consider
observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
(BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the bestfit
values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available
Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different
constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's
best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4
km/s/Mpc, \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}, \Omega_{\Lambda 0} =
0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}, and \Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001. To estimate
H(z), we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression,
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter
analyze the results with the theoretically developed H(z) for the proposed
model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the
performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger
dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms
of ML view point.

Abstract: We introduce a general algebraic decomposition of Riemann-like and Weyl-like
tensors with respect to a non-null vector $u$. We derive Gauss, Codazzi and
Ricci-type identities for the Weyl tensor, that allow to relate the components
of the spacetime Weyl tensor with intrinsic quantities of the hypersurfaces
orthogonal to $u$.
  Restricting to the case of $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes (with $\Lambda \neq 0$
and any dimension) admiting a conformal compactification, we then study the
behaviour of the Weyl tensor near $\mathscr I$ by means of an asymptotic
expansion {\it \`a la} Fefferman-Graham, where the first terms are explicitly
computed. We use these tools to characterize four dimensional algebraically
special spacetimes with locally conformally flat $\mathscr{I}$, showing they
match exactly the so-called {\it Kerr-de Sitter-like class with conformally
flat $\scri$}, thus providing a geometric characterization of this class of
spacetimes.

Abstract: Direct detections of gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to test
gravity in the highly dynamical and strong field regime. Current tests are
typically performed assuming signals from quasi-circular binaries. However, the
complex waveform morphology induced by orbital eccentricity can enhance our
ability to probe gravity with greater precision. A recent analysis of the
neutron star-black hole event GW200105 identified strong evidence for orbital
eccentricity. We extend an eccentric-precessing waveform model to test
alternative models with this signal by incorporating eccentric corrections
induced by Brans-Dicke, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical
Chern-Simons gravity at leading post-Newtonian order. We show that analyzing
this event with a quasi-circular model leads to a false deviation from general
relativity, while the inclusion of eccentricity improves the bounds on the
models. Our analysis of GW200105 places tight constraints on
Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, $\alpha^{1/2}_{\text{EdGB}} \lesssim
2.38\,\text{km}$, and Brans-Dicke gravity, $\omega_{\text{BD}} \gtrsim 3.5$,
while dynamical Chern-Simons gravity remains unconstrained due to the low spin
content.

Abstract: This paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of a uniform-density
star in scalar-Einstein-{\AE}ther theory. By applying the Israel junction
conditions explicitly in the presence of a scalar field minimally coupled to
the gravitational sector, it is shown that a nontrivial scalar profile cannot
be sustained, as it induces a divergence at the stellar center. Since
analytical solutions are unattainable, the background metric is determined
through numerical integration for a few representative configurations. For
axial gravitational perturbations, it is found that the system of equations of
motion cannot be decoupled as long as the {\AE}ther parameter $c_i$ does not
vanish. Subsequently, the dynamics of the system can be simplified to two
coupled equations that describe vector and tensor perturbations with distinct
wave velocities $c_V$ and $c_T$, giving rise to a bimodal system. It is shown
that as the stellar radius is smaller than that of the maximum of the vacuum
Schwarzschild-type effective potential, a potential well is formed, leading to
the emergence of echo phenomenon for the axial gravitational perturbations.
When the stellar radius exceeds the {\it could-have-been} maximum, the
resulting effective potential decreases monotonically, and the wave propagation
is primarily dictated by the discontinuity occurring at the star's surface,
producing a type of more attenuated echo waves. In addition, we explore the
specific properties of the resultant bimodal medium consisting of two degrees
of freedom with distinct sound speeds. However, it is understood that such a
characteristic does not lead to observational implications, and subsequently
hardly offers a potential empirical means to constrain specific metric
parameters of the Einstein-{\AE}ther. We present numerical calculations and
discuss the potential implications of our findings.

Method: 采用贝叶斯分析，基于对数正态质量函数，计算PBH双星的合并率分布，并结合LIGO/Virgo第三轮观测数据约束。

Result: PBH合并率在红移演化指数上表现出较弱的推断（α=2.19±0.16），本地合并率范围为23.5-30.3 Gpc⁻³yr⁻¹。

Conclusion: 随机引力波背景观测有望揭示PBH合并的宇宙历史累积效应。

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are well-motivated candidates for cold dark
matter and may also account for a fraction of the binary black hole mergers
observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. In this study, we investigate
the gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on
evaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave
background arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We
perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all
Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass
function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting
for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we
employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to
their primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high
redshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a
relatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger
rate, with $\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\% confidence level. The local
merger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the
range $23.5-30.3~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree
of statistical precision in the inferred distribution. Additionally, we
emphasize the potential of stochastic gravitational-wave background
observations to probe the cumulative history of PBH mergers across cosmic time.

Abstract: The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to
a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the
context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated
that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length,
which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within
this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the
electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal
length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from
ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We
further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting
solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical
analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the
charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding
gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production
using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the
no-boundary proposal.

Abstract: We explore dark matter phenomenology in Myrzakulov $F(R,T)$ gravity,
formulated via the vielbein approach in Weitzenb\"{o}ck spacetime. In this
torsion-based extension of gravity, dark matter emerges as a geometric effect
rather than a particle species, with curvature and torsion contributing
dynamically to the field equations. Using recent data -- including SPARC galaxy
rotation curves, Planck CMB observations, and weak lensing from DES and KiDS --
we constrain the model through MCMC analysis. Our results show that, under
specific parameter choices, the theory replicates key cosmological features
without introducing additional dark sector matter. This framework offers a
testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, providing new insight into structure
formation, gravitational lensing, and cosmic acceleration -- all rooted in the
geometry of spacetime.

Abstract: As space exploration extends into cislunar space and further towards Mars,
understanding the relativistic effects on clocks on Mars, particularly in
relation to multibody gravitational influences, becomes increasingly important
for accurate clock synchronization. This study estimates clock rates on Mars
and compares them to those on the Moon and Earth. We find that, on average,
clocks on Mars tick faster than those on the Earth's geoid by 477 microseconds
per day, with a variation of 226 microseconds per day over a Martian year.
Additionally, there is an amplitude modulation of approximately 40 microseconds
per day over seven synodic cycles. We also introduce a formalism for addressing
the effects of solar tides on the Earth-Moon system for predicting clock rates
on the Moon and Mars more accurately when compared to using only Keplerian
orbit approximations. Our analysis quantifies the relativistic proper time
offsets among Martian, lunar, and terrestrial clocks, highlighting important
implications for mission planning and the implementation of timekeeping systems
on Mars.

Abstract: Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with
quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes
with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of
skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of
regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such
objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective
potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections,
allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark
matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces
shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of
perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations:
scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal
mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases,
altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor
field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles,
revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These
results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the
dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.

Abstract: Recent observational evidences point out towards a late time acceleration of
the universe. In order to study the accelerated expansion, scientists have
incorporated the existence of an exotic matter with negative pressure, termed
as dark energy. Afterwards a new idea of dark energy have been studied
depending on the holographic principle of quantum gravity, called as the
Holographic Dark Energy(HDE). Later on modifying Bekestein-Hawking entropy,
different generalized entropies have been proposed, one of them being R\'enyi
entropy which leads to R\'enyi holographic dark energy model (RHDE). We have
considered RHDE model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut off and have studied
the cosmological behaviour under non interacting, linear and non-linear
interacting scenarios with the help of dynamical systems analysis. We have also
investigated the stability of the system around hyperbolic critical points
along with the type of fluid description, evolution of equation of state

Abstract: The orbital evolution of binary black hole (BBH) systems is determined by the
component masses and spins of the black holes and the governing gravity theory.
Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the evolution of BBH orbits offer an
unparalleled opportunity for examining the predictions of General Relativity
(GR) and for searching for missing physics in the current waveform models. We
present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the
orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the
orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy
peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory
of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is
executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will
be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether
our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the
numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework
of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new
method in detecting any possible departure from GR. Finally, when applied to an
eccentric BBH system and GW190814, which shows the signatures of higher-order
multipoles, our method provides an exquisite probe of missing physics in the GR
waveform models.

Abstract: We investigate relativistic Bondi accretion in the Simpson-Visser spacetime,
which, via a single parameter $\ell$, interpolates between the Schwarzschild,
regular black hole, extremal and wormhole regimes. First, we analyze the
neutral Simpson-Visser geometry, recovering Schwarzschild at $\ell=0$, and then
its charged extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. In both these cases,
we derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid
models: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential
density profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical
(sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While
near-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we
find that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and
luminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type
of fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different
trends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged
SV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces
additional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination
with those induced by the regularization parameter $\ell$, could provide a
double observational marker. In particular, while $\ell$ acts predominantly on
the position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the
electromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near
the horizon.

Abstract: Setting up a relativistic lunar reference frame is of a prime importance in
the context of future exploration missions to the Moon. If the procedure for
building a consistent reference frame within the framework of the general
theory of relativity is well established (cf. resolutions B.3 of IAU 2000),
there is still some freedom in the choice of the coordinate timescale to be
adopted as reference in the cislunar region. In this paper, we review the
orders of magnitude of the relativistic effects resulting from (i) the
gravitational redshift of a clock on the lunar surface and (ii) the time
transformations between a clock on the surface of the Moon and a clock on the
surface of the Earth. We then discuss possible options for a lunar reference
timescale with their advantages and drawbacks. Finally, we propose possible
realizations of the lunar reference timescale as well as its traceability to
UTC.

Conclusion: Van der Waals黑洞的热力学拓扑性质在量子修正下表现出稳定性和多样性，为黑洞热力学研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the universal extremality relation and
thermodynamic topology of Van der Waals (VdW) black holes-solutions of
Einstein's equations whose thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of Van
der Waals fluids. In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the
Bekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation.
We then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the
Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle
(EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we
find that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds.
Next, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the
distribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in
the black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological
classifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the
GUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against
parameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected
black holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some
configurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others
maintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge
counts. The Rainbow Gravity-corrected scenario shows similar consistency in
topological behavior.

Abstract: Recently, a class of exact solutions describing rotating black holes immersed
in a uniform magnetic field has been proposed, and various properties of such
black holes remain unclear. This paper aims to explore how to extract energy
based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism in both the circular orbit region
and the plunging region. After introducing the properties of this spacetime, we
analyze physical quantities such as the size of the ergoregion, the event
horizon, and the boundaries of the ergosphere. We then analyze the magnetic
reconnection process within circular orbits. We plot energy extraction
parameter diagrams, and analyze the power and efficiency of energy extraction.
The results show that the magnetic field impedes energy extraction. Comparing
with Kerr black holes and Kerr-Melvin black holes, we find that this black
hole's energy extraction capability is stronger than that of the Kerr-Melvin
black hole but weaker than that of the Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we study
magnetic reconnection and energy extraction in the plunging region of this
black hole. The results indicate that the magnetic field still impedes energy
extraction. The black hole's energy extraction capability in this region also
remains weaker than that of a Kerr black hole but stronger than that of a
Kerr-Melvin black hole. Comparing the plunging region with the circular orbit
region, we find that the energy extraction power in the plunging region is
consistently stronger than in the circular orbit region.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一框架，用于在一般静态时空中建模量子干涉仪，以一致描述经典引力对量子探针的影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子干涉实验在外引力场中的模型缺乏统一框架，不同实验采用不同方法描述引力效应。

Method: 开发了一个统一框架，用于在一般静态时空中建模量子干涉仪。

Result: 该模型提供了对经典引力对量子探针影响的严格描述和一致解释。

Conclusion: 统一框架为量子干涉实验提供了更一致和严格的理论基础。

Abstract: Current models of quantum interference experiments in external gravitational
fields lack a common framework: while matter-wave interferometers are commonly
described using the Schr\"odinger equation with a Newtonian potential,
gravitational effects in quantum optics are modeled using either post-Newtonian
metrics or highly symmetric exact solutions to Einstein's field equations such
as those of Schwarzschild and Kerr. To coherently describe both kinds of
experiments, this paper develops a unified framework for modeling quantum
interferometers in general stationary space-times. This model provides a
rigorous description and coherent interpretation of the effects of classical
gravity on quantum probes.

Motivation: 扩展静态时空的有效势方法，以研究动态时空中的轨道动力学，特别是黑洞动力学。

Method: 引入动态势概念，提出三个条件：轨道半径不显式依赖仿射参数、动态势沿轨道不变、角动量守恒。

Result: 动态势条件与准局部方法等效，为分析动态引力场中的轨道动力学提供统一框架。

Conclusion: 该方法连接传统有效势与动态时空研究，为黑洞合并和相对论系统演化提供新工具。

Abstract: In this work, we extend the effective potential method to dynamical
spacetimes by introducing a novel concept of dynamical potential and
establishing three fundamental conditions that govern the evolution of circular
orbits in such spacetimes. By generalizing the framework from static to
dynamical spacetimes, we propose three conditions for the evolution equation of
circular orbits: (1) The orbital radius of the evolving circular orbits does
not explicitly depend on the affine parameter; (2) the dynamical potential does
not change along the evolving circular orbits; and (3) the angular momentum of
the evolving circular orbits is conserved. The dynamical potential conditions
yield evolution equations for circular orbits that are shown to be equivalent
to the quasi-local method. This approach provides a unified framework for
analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields, with direct
implications for black hole dynamics. The results bridge traditional effective
potential methods with dynamical spacetime studies, enhancing the tools
available for probing black hole mergers and evolving relativistic systems.

Motivation: 研究二次引力理论中Kerr时空的线性扰动，以更好地理解引力理论中的非线性效应。

Method: 使用Newman-Penrose形式化和Teukolsky方法，线性化场方程并结合Ricci和Bianchi恒等式。

Result: 得到仅需Ricci张量扰动即可完全确定解的微分方程，并在Schwarzschild和Minkowski几何中验证。

Conclusion: 该方法为二次引力理论中的Kerr时空扰动提供了有效的分析工具。

Abstract: Employing the Newman-Penrose formalism and following the classic
Teukolsky-like approach, we linearise the field equations of quadratic gravity
on the Kerr background and combine them with the linearised Ricci and Bianch
identities. This leads to constraints on linear perturbations of the Kerr
spacetime in quadratic gravity. The resulting differential equations are
decoupled in such a way that only the Ricci tensor perturbations need to be
found on the Kerr background in order to fully determine the solution. The
results are illustrated in the simple non-trivial cases of the Schwarzschild
and Minkowski geometries.

Motivation: 探讨Lorentz对称性破缺（LV）对黑洞吸积动力学的影响，特别是通过Kalb-Ramond场修正的黑洞解。

Method: 使用哈密顿动力学系统方法分析等温流体（$p=\omega\rho$）和多方流体（$p=\mathcal{K}\rho^{\Gamma}$）的临界点和声速过渡。

Result: LV参数$l$影响临界点位置、流动结构和吸积率，$l>0$增强吸积率，$l<0$抑制吸积率。超硬流体无临界点，超相对论和辐射流体存在跨声速解。

Conclusion: Lorentz对称性破缺显著改变黑洞时空中的吸积动力学。

Abstract: We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a
Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field
implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is
analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state
$p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation
fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density
$\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a
Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical
points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show
that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow
structure, and the accretion rate, with $l>0$ ($l<0$) enhancing (suppressing)
the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow
remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids,
transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on
the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K}
\rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar
qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the
equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz
symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole
spacetimes.

Motivation: 解决DAMA实验暗物质探测的独立验证问题，改进NaI(Tl)探测器在低能区的灵敏度。

Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment
remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards
its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with
improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments
rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,
which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic
radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D
project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is
read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon
detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark
noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at
cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed
cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the
detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first
experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large
area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a
preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising,
also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and
the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the
sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation
PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this
technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale
experiments.
