These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime."}

The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $ζ=\\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology."}

Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2σ$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=γ\\pm βr \\pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data."}

In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches. The slow-roll era is found to be compatible with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data."}

This design maintains stable radiation performance even when the longitudinal wavenumber of the incident guided mode - and thus its effective impinging angle - varies as a function of frequency. In particular, we show that there exists a limit to achieving exact angular insensitivity and propose an optimization-based framework to obtain the required susceptibilities that closely approximate near angle-insensitive performance for stable beam-steering performance. Additionally, an iterative synthesis approach is introduced that maps abstract susceptibilities to physically realizable structures. Full-wave simulations demonstrate a beam-scanning range of nearly 50 degrees over the 2.0-2.7 THz band - a more than threefold improvement over conventional local-metasurface designs."}

Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity."}

The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers.

The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\\left(\\frac{ρ(r)}{ρ_{\\star}}\\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $ρ(r)=\\frac{ρ_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\\frac{K_0}{\\left( 1+\\frac{r^2}{α^2}\\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \\pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation."}

The two 3He-rich SEP events, originating from active region (AR) 13615, exhibit two key anomalies: (1) sunward streaming SEPs and (2) SEP travel path lengths exceeding 2 - 8 times the nominal Parker spiral expectations. Remote observations suggest these SEPs have been redirected by a slow coronal mass ejection (CME) that also originated from AR 13615 two days prior on March 30, 2024 at 21:04 UT. Using the near-Sun CME speed and width measurements, we estimate its size and location at the onset time of the first 3He-rich SEP event. Based on our estimates, SEPs propagating around the ICME front have travelled between 0.76 - 0.95 AU when they arrive at SO, increasing to 0.94 - 1.1 AU at PSP, consistent with our observed SEP arrival times. These findings constitute the first multi-spacecraft observation of sunward streaming 3He-rich SEPs. We discuss the implications of this phenomenon on 3He-rich seed material and the rare widespread 3He-rich SEP events (see Section 5.4)."}

In horizontal beam geometries, widely used in both laboratory and synchrotron facilities, the natural spreading (wetting) of molten samples on substrates significantly reduces the effective vertical optical path length, detrimental to signal quality in transmission-mode measurements. To overcome this limitation, we introduced a thermocouple assisted active geometry modulation technique. This method mechanically lifts the spreading melt into a liquid bridge via surface tension, optimizing the transmission path length while simultaneously enabling in situ temperature monitoring. The device features a triple fiber coupled laser head with high power density, a precision closed loop Proportional Integral Derivative temperature control system, and an atmosphere controlled vacuum chamber coupled with a mass spectrometer. This integration allows for simultaneous evolved gas analysis, enabling the correlation of structural phase transitions with chemical volatilization or reaction dynamics.

Comparison with experimental data confirmed that the modules are effectively insensitive to neutrons, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with an estimated SNR of 17 for a module placed at 25 cm from the 148 MeV proton beam axis.

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors."}

To cope with such collision and data rates, ALICE uses a new GEM TPC with continuous readout and a GPU-based online computing farm for data compression. Operating the first GEM TPC of this size with large space charge distortions due to the high collision rate has many implications for the track reconstruction algorithm, both anticipated and unanticipated. With real Pb-Pb data available, the TPC tracking algorithm needed to be refined, particularly with respect to improved cluster attachment at the inner TPC region. In order to use the online computing farm efficiently for offline processing when there is no beam in the LHC, ALICE is currently running TPC tracking on GPUs also in offline processing. For the future, ALICE aims to run more computing steps on the GPU, and to use other GPU-enabled resources besides its online computing farm. These aspects, along with better possibilities for performance optimizations led to several improvements of the GPU framework and GPU tracking code, particularly using Run Time Compilation (RTC). The talk will give an overview of the improvements for the ALICE tracking code, mostly based on experience from reconstructing real Pb-Pb data with high TPC occupancy. In addition, an overview of the online and offline processing status on GPUs will be given, and an overview of how RTC improves the ALICE tracking code and GPU support."}

Accepted for publication in Classical and Quantum Gravity", "summary": "Building upon our recently established correspondence between quantum cosmology and the hydrogen atom [1], we investigate the specific sector of a negative cosmological constant ($Λ< 0$) in a flat FLRW universe with dust. While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.\n  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.\n  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils."}

Published in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*."}

Using the tunnelling formalism, we obtain a modified Hawking temperature different from previous works due to the quantum gravity effect for the charged Dirac particle at the HNKNK AdS black hole's horizon. We find that the modified Hawking temperature is affected by the cosmological constant, magnetic mass, electric and magnetic charges. We demonstrate that a significant number of discontinuities exist in the heat capacities of the HNKNK AdS, indicating that the black hole system becomes unstable as the black hole size decreases."}

We analytically investigate the violation of the LGI in the context of photon-graviton conversion in a magnetic field background, motivated by its potential applications to testing the nonclassicality of gravity. When gravitational perturbations are quantized as gravitons, the conversion of an initial single photon state gives rise to a superposition of photon and graviton states. We show that the temporal correlations obtained from successive projective measurements on the photon-graviton system violate the LGI. Observation of such a violation would provide a novel avenue for probing the quantum nature of gravity."}

A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR)."}

In this picture, the GW acts as a coherent background that induces inelastic energy exchanges with the electromagnetic field - analogous to the Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts in Raman spectroscopy. We propose a detection scheme sensitive to this microscopic mechanism based on Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. We show that the scattering-induced phase shifts render frequency-entangled photon pairs distinguishable, spoiling their destructive quantum interference. GW signal is thus encoded in the modulation of photon coincidence rates rather than classical field intensity, offering a complementary quantum probe of the gravitational universe that recovers the standard classical response in the macroscopic limit."}

In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $μ_c$, horizon mass $μ_H$, and profile slope $λ$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $λ$, larger $μ_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $μ_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $μ_H$. When $μ_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $ω$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $μ_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $μ_H$ and $ω$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $ω$ approaches $μ_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit."}

We extend this framework to incorporate gravitationally induced particle creation, treating the region enclosed by the apparent horizon as an open thermodynamic system. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the recognition that the apparent horizon volume is not comoving; this requires a consistent accounting of particle exchange across the moving boundary. We demonstrate that the evolution of the particle number, and explicitly the matter entropy, can be decomposed into two distinct physical contributions: genuine bulk particle production and a net flux induced by the dynamics of the horizon itself. Finally, we derive the Generalized Second Law (GSL) in this setting, showing transparently how the total entropy budget is balanced by horizon thermodynamics, bulk creation, and boundary fluxes."}
