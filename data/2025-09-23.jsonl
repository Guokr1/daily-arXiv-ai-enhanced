However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to\nobtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF\nvariations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with\nerrors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and\ndiscuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based\nparameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve\nthe robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm\nsurveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating\nrealistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to\ninclude multiple other effects."}

Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in\nsuch experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We\nconsider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized\natmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly\nimplemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each\nfocal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously\nrotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical\ndown-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing\n(PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the\nsame focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case\nwhere the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show\nthat PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general\nassumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the\nabsence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise\nvariations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse\nthan the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it\nrequires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD\nperformance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking\natmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain\nmismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive,\nrobust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without\natmospheric modeling."}

We find that while such environments\ncan destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic\nobjects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain\nremarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral\ninstabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes,\ntrapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object,\nand exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an\novertaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose\ninto ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward.

However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II.

To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout.

A central challenge in matter-type\nmodified gravity theories, including EMSG, is the non-vanishing divergence of\nthe energy-momentum tensor, arising from the nonminimal interaction between the\nstandard and modified matter fields. This feature can, in principle, influence\nthe $N$-body dynamics. In our previous work [1], its effects on the\nexternal-dependent part of the motion were studied in an EMSG class known as\nquadratic-EMSG. Here, we extend the analysis to the\ninternal-structure-dependent contributions, namely self-acceleration. To this\nend, we relax the reflection-symmetric assumption adopted in [1] and derive the\ncomplete equations of motion for a self-gravitating body in an $N$-body system\nup to the first PN order. By introducing a suitable expression for the\ncenter-of-mass acceleration and employing virial identities, including one\nnewly emerging within the quadratic-EMSG framework, it is shown that\nself-acceleration vanishes. Furthermore, we establish a PN integral\nconservation law for the total momentum, demonstrating that, as in general\nrelativity (GR), EMSG admits a conserved linear momentum compatible with the\nabsence of self-acceleration. Binary pulsar experiments provide stringent\nbounds on self-acceleration, and our analysis shows that, within the present\nlevel of accuracy, EMSG is consistent with these constraints.

Considering a thin\naccretion disk in the equatorial plane as the light source, we systematically\ninvestigate the optical appearance of boson stars using the ray-tracing method\nand the stereographic projection technique. Particular attention is paid to the\ninfluence of the initial scalar field $\\phi_0$, the magnetic charge\n$\\mathcal{G}$, and the observation angle $\\theta_o$, on the image structure. As\ncompact horizonless objects, boson stars produce optical images dominated by\ndirect emission, while their morphology undergoes significant distortions as\n$\\theta_o$ increases. Higher values of $\\phi_0$ and $\\theta_o$ can give rise to\nlensing images. For all the parameters, the image center exhibits a brightness\ndepression similar to the inner shadow of black holes, which poses challenges\nfor distinguishing between boson stars and black holes. To address this, we\npropose two possible approaches: (i) combining the analysis of lensing bands\nwith the effective potential to determine the existence of photon rings; and\n(ii) examining the polarization effects under synchrotron emission mechanisms.\nThese results provide theoretical support for future high-resolution imaging\nefforts aimed at discriminating boson stars from black holes."}

In\nparticular, the merger phase, during which two compact objects finally\ncoalesce, corresponds to the regime of the strongest gravitational fields\naccessible by direct observation and thus serves as a probe of the nonlinear\nnature of gravity. In this work, we test GR in the merger phase by analyzing\nGW150914 using a modified waveform proposed in [Watarai et al. 2024], which\nparametrizes possible deviations from GR during this stage. Within this\nframework, the inferred deviation parameters can be translated into\nmodel-independent constraints on physically meaningful quantities. For\nGW150914, we find that the additional energy radiated in the merger phase is\nconstrained to be $0.26^{+0.75}_{-0.62}~\\%$ of the total energy emitted over\nthe entire coalescence predicted by GR, and the deviation in the coalescence\ntime is $2.17^{+9.56}_{-9.90}~\\mathrm{ms}$, both within the $90\\%$ credible\ninterval. These two constraints serve as observational benchmarks for\ndeviations in the nonlinear gravity regime, offering guidance for theoretical\ninvestigations of beyond-GR models."}
