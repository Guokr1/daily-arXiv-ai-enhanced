Our analysis reveals that the creation\nfield coupling constant $(f)$ is always positive within the Narlikar gravity\nmodel from OHD+PP data sets. The best-fit estimates yield $ H_0 = 71.2 \\pm 2.1\n\\text{km s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\xi_0 = 0.23$, quoted at the $1 \\sigma$\nlevel. The Narlikar gravity model predicts a transition redshift of $z_t\n\\approx 0.63$ marking the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration, with the\ncorresponding age of the Universe estimated as $13.50\\pm1.80 Gyr$.\nInterestingly, the inferred higher value of $H_0$, relative to SH0ES\ndeterminations, suggests a possible alleviation of the $\\sim 4.1\\sigma$ Hubble\ntension. Furthermore, we assess the stability of the model and demonstrate that\nthe late-time acceleration can be consistently explained through the energy\nconditions. This model retains dynamical flexibility while ensuring analytical\ntractability and provides a promising framework to investigate the cosmological\nimplications of Hoyle-Narlikar gravity, particularly regarding late-time\nacceleration and the evolution of dark energy."}

These\nantennas measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$\nMHz band, enabling electromagnetic energy measurements for air showers with\nzenith angles above $65\\deg$. Combined with the muonic measurements from the\nwater-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs), this allows mass composition studies at the\nhighest energies. The large-scale deployment of the RD began in November 2023\nand was completed in November 2024. A full end-to-end calibration shows\nconsistency between Galactic and in-lab calibration to better than $5$\\% and\nincludes continuous monitoring for hardware failures, ensuring, for example,\nantenna alignment within $5\\deg$. We present the first data, demonstrating a\nstrong correlation between the electromagnetic energy measured by the RD and\nthe total shower energy measured by the WCD, confirming that the detector chain\n- including triggering, data readout, absolute calibration, and reconstruction\nis well understood.
