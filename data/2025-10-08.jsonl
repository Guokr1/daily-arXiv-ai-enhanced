The wide swath of\nthe VIIRS-DNB sensor enables detection of artificial light at multiple angles\nand was utilized to study emission of artificial light from cities at different\nangles as well as atmospheric properties. Existing studies of the relationship\nbetween the directionality and land surface features are not available for most\nof the Earth's surface due to the use of space-borne LiDAR as a source of\nproxy. To solve this problem, we compared the land use data published under the\nCoordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) against the fit\nparameters of radiance of upward artificial light. In general, the quadratic\nterm of the fit, which quantifies how the brightness changes when viewing\ncloser from the horizon at a point on the Earth, is negative when the area is\n\"Continuous urban fabric\" or \"Sparsely vegetated areas\", and vice versa for all\nother investigated land use classes. However the quadratic term shifts towards\nnegative values for brighter areas. These results indicate that while densely\nbuilt areas emit more light towards the zenith than sideways, the VIIRS-DNB is\nunable to distinguish small densely built areas scattered around larger unbuilt\nareas. Therefore, sensors with higher spatial resolution will be required to\nresolve the light emission patterns of areas with complicated combinations of\nland uses."}

In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes\nwith sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions\nof the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the\nmetric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating\nthe marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for\ntimelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum,\nand energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\\alpha} for both\norbits.

Using simulations, we show that the ratio of locally\ncontrollable volume to the state-space volume correlates strongly with $S$.\nThis ratio can be efficiently computed from the pressure field geometry as it\ndoes not involve solving a control problem, thus opening possibilities for\nexperimental and numerical device optimization routines. Further, we show\nnumerically that in noise-free 1D systems $S \\approx 1 - P/M$, and that in\nnoisy 1D and 2D systems $S$ is accurately predicted by Wendel's Theorem. We\nalso show that the relationship between $M$ and $P$ for a given $S$ is\napproximately linear, suggesting that as long as $P/M$ is constant, $S$ will\nremain unchanged. We validate this finding by successfully simulating the\ncontrol of systems with up to $60$ particles with up to $600$ modes."}

The only such event observed in both\ngravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, GW170817, revealed the\norigin of heavy elements, constrained the neutron star equation of state, and\nprovided an independent measurement of the Hubble constant. Current detectors\nsuch as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA capture only the final minutes of inspiral,\noffering limited advance warning and coarse sky localization. In this study, we\npresent a comprehensive analysis of binary neutron star signals for lunar-based\ngravitational-wave observatories (LILA, LGWA, GLOC) envisioned within NASA's\nArtemis and Commercial Lunar Payload Services programs, and compare their\nperformance with current and next-generation Earth-based facilities. For\nGW170817-like sources, we find that lunar detectors can forecast mergers weeks\nto months in advance and localize them to areas as small as 0.01 deg$^{2}$, far\nbeyond the reach of terrestrial detectors. We further show that lunar\nobservatories would detect on the order of 100 well-localized mergers annually,\nenabling coordinated multi-messenger follow-up. When combined in a multi-band\nLIGO+Moon network, sky-localization areas shrink to just a few arcsec$^{2}$,\ncomparable to the field of view of the James Webb Space Telescope at high zoom.\nMulti-band parameter estimation also delivers dramatic gains: neutron star\nmass-ratio uncertainties can be measured with $\\sim0.1\\%$ precision, spin\nconstraints to 0.001$\\%$ with luminosity distance errors to 1$\\%$ level,\nenabling precision measurements of the equation of state and the cosmic\nexpansion rate.

Furthermore, exploiting the inherent conformal symmetry\nof the theory, we take advantage of the natural enlargement of the exact\nsolutions to motivate the construction of a regular spacetime via conformal\nrescaling of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, we ensure the\nspacetime completeness by investigating the regularity of the curvature\ninvariants and the geodesic completeness of conformally/non-conformally coupled\nmassive and massless particles. We also study the global causal structure by\nexplicitly constructing the Penrose diagram of the regular spacetime.\nFurthermore, as a result of the spacetime completeness analysis, we generalize\nthe range of conformal factors that generate regular spacetimes, by considering\nthe $N$ parameter of the conformal factor as a real parameter with a lower\nbound, and not only a positive integer, as constrained in previous studies on\nregular Schwarzschild/Kerr black holes. Thus, the present analysis broadens the\nrange of solutions of the finite conformal quantum theory and opens the window\nto more precise observational tests of the theory using astrophysical data, by\nconsidering the accelerated expansion of the universe."}

I. Periodic orbits", "comment": "32 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of the Kerr-Newman black\nhole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations\nin the pole-dipole approximation through the spin-curvature coupling to the\nleading order in its spin. In terms of conserved quantities, one can transform\nthe dynamical equations in the Mino time into an integral form for both aligned\nand misaligned spins with orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be\nsolved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The\nradial potential can be derived in order to study the parameter space of the\nparticle for various types of orbit, based on its roots obtained with the\ncorrections of the particle's spin. We consider motion oscillating around two\nturning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential on\nthe equatorial plane in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced\noscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the oscillation\nperiods of the motion are obtained. When the orbits become a source of\ngravitational wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in\ndetermining the gravitational waves in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge\nwaveforms are constructed. The gravitational wave amplitudes are found to be\nsensitive to the turning points of the orbits as measured from the black holes.\nThe implications for gravitational wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio\ninspirals (EMRIs) are discussed."}

Due to the surprising\nlack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there\nis no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a\nCauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in\ngeneral relativity.

Further,\ncomputing the population likelihood becomes less accurate as the catalog grows.\nCurrent methods to address these challenges often scale poorly with the number\nof events and potentially become infeasible for future catalogs. Here, we\nevaluate a simple remedy: increasing the significance threshold for including\nevents in population analyses. To determine the efficacy of this approach, we\nanalyze simulated catalogs of up to 1600 gravitational-wave signals from\nblack-hole mergers using full Bayesian parameter estimation with current\ndetector sensitivities. We show that the growth in statistical uncertainty\nabout the black-hole population, as we analyze fewer events but with higher\nSNR, depends on the source parameters of interest. When the SNR threshold is\nraised from 11 to 15 -- reducing our catalog size by two--thirds -- we find\nthat statistical uncertainties on the mass distribution only grow by a few 10%\nand constraints on the spin distribution are essentially unchanged; meanwhile,\nuncertainties on the high-redshift cosmic merger rate more than double.\nSimultaneously, numerical uncertainty in the estimate of the population\nlikelihood more than halves, allowing us to ensure unbiased inference without\nadditional computational expense.
