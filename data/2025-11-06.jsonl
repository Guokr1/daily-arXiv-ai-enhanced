In our Solar System, we observe its effects directly:\natmospheric escape, chemical disruption, and spectacular auroral displays. Yet\nfor exoplanets, we lack the tools and data to comprehensively assess the\nimpacts of space weather, especially invisible elements like stellar winds,\ncoronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and variable interplanetary\nmagnetic fields. This problem lies at the intersection of four key fields:\nheliophysics, planetary science, astrobiology, and astrophysics. In 2023--2025,\nexperts from these four fields convened at the W. M. Keck Institute for Space\nStudies to explore pathways for advancing the study of exospace weather.\nOrganizing the subject into five core themes -- planets and their stellar\nparticle environments, stellar magnetism and space weather modeling,\nquasi-steady stellar winds, transient events, and programmatic pathways -- our\nteam synthesized concepts from across relevant fields and identified a wide\narray of opportunities for progress. This report is the product of that effort.\nIt assembles cross-disciplinary knowledge; highlights outstanding theoretical\nchallenges; explores promising innovations in observation, modeling,\nmethodology, and instrumentation; and makes recommendations for accelerating\ncommunity-wide progress. Together, these lay out a path to transforming the\nchallenging, yet tractable problem of exospace weather into a foundational\nelement of our understanding exoplanetary systems, and our own Solar System, in\ntheir entirety."}

The annual call for observing time proposals continues to experience a\nhigh level of oversubscription, typically ranging from a factor of 6 to 7. In\norder to enhance the scientific discovery space, XMM-Newton, primarily through\nthe Project Scientist and Science Operations Centre, has pursued a strategy of\nexpansion, which can be grouped into three phases: Large Projects with long\nobserving time (2006-2009), Joint Observations (2011-2016), and Targets of\nOpportunity (2016-2024), respectively. A salient feature of XMM-Newton's time\nallocation is the systematic removal of biases from the second call onwards, a\nstrategy that has enabled the attainment of comparable gender success rates and\nhigh acceptance rates for young scientists over 25 years, a feat only recently\naccomplished by similar missions through the introduction of double-anonymous\nreview. XMM-Newton research is conducted by an active community of 4,300\nscientists, of which approximately 570 are leading (1st author). The foundation\nof this community and its research is predicated on XMM-Newton data, with the\nproject's policy of user support and calibration being fundamental\nconstituents, as well as the project's active engagement and communication with\nits members."}

The intrinsic low\ngranularity of LGADs and the large power consumption of readout chips for\nprecise timing are problematic in near-future experiments such as e+e- Higgs\nfactories (FCC-ee) and the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider.\nAC-coupled LGADs, where the readout metal is AC-coupled through an insulating\noxide layer, could solve both issues at the same time thanks to the 100% fill\nfactor and charge-sharing capabilities.

However, residual aberrations, especially\nnon-common path aberrations between the AO channel and the coronagraph channel,\nlimit the instrument performance. While post-processing techniques such as\nspectral or angular differential imaging (ADI) can partially address those\nissues, they suffer from self-subtraction and inefficiencies at small angular\nseparations or when observations are conducted far from transit. We previously\ndemonstrated the on-sky performance of coherent differential imaging (CDI),\nwhich offers a promising alternative. It allows for isolating coherent\nstarlight residuals through speckle modulation, which can then be subtracted\nfrom the raw images during post-processing. This work aims to validate a CDI\nmethod on real science targets, demonstrating its effectiveness in imaging\nalmost face-on circumstellar disks, which are typically challenging to retrieve\nwith ADI. We temporally modulated the speckle field in VLT/SPHERE images,\napplying small phase offsets on the AO deformable mirror while observing stars\nsurrounded by circumstellar material: HR 4796A, CPD-36 6759, HD 169142, and HD\n163296. We hence separated the astrophysical scene from the stellar speckle\nfield, whose lights are mutually incoherent. Combining a dozen of data frames\nand reference coronagraph point spread functions through a Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nimage projection framework, we recover the circumstellar disks without the\nartifacts that are usually introduced by common post-processing algorithms\n(e.g., self-subtraction).

Notably, the quantum Dirac\nequation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam\nof massive spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the\nspin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous\ntheoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles'\nintrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative\nmagnitude $>10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles with\nrest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole.\nAlthough highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the\nneutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum\nspin correction."}

Using the vielbein formalism, we derive the Wald entropy\nfor various subclasses of these models, extending the classical entropy formula\nto accommodate non-Riemannian geometry. Our focus is on how the additional\ngeometric degrees of freedom modify the entropy expression. The analysis shows\nthat such corrections arise systematically from the extended structure of the\naction and preserve diffeomorphism invariance.

For\nthis purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the\ngravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of\nType N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of\ntorsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered\nto eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the\ntheory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function\nthat includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity\ntensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these\nquantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave\nspectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the\nordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity."}

The presence of the halo modifies the\nspacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing\nthe particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the\nconditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic\ntrajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By\nanalyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure,\nwe identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon\nregion. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents\ncalculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along\nwith energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We\ndemonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability\nof particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal\nsurface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of\nhorizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a\ntheoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave\nsignals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system."}
