TL;DR: 基于碳碳水晶中氮-空位(NV)中心的可扩展量子生物感知平台，通过DNA微数组集成实现高密度多重检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决量子感矩阵缺乏高密度空间多重复用与高生物化学特异性的问题，实现标签免除的高速并行生物分子检测

Method: 将多重DNA微数组(7x7数组)集成到次纳米防污碳碳表面，通过目标物导向的位移机制将分子识别转换为量子信号(Gd标记DNA销除恢复NV自旋松醒时间)

Result: 实现了49个独立生物分子特征的同时检测，具有高空间分辨率和重现性，通过莖光显微镜验证

Conclusion: 建立了高速并多重量子生物感知的新范式，为复杂生物环境中的先进分子诊断和大规模量子感矩网络打开了大门

Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to
revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high
sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events
with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way,
avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been
hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial
multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a
scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by
integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer
antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip,
enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high
spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy.
Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced
displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA
strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a
binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for
high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced
molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in
complex biological environments.

TL;DR: 研究了在降雨期间通过NaI(Tl)探测器水平分析得到的高频率Pb-214和Bi-214源项模型，以支持放射安全和询问算法的训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降雨期间Rn-222后代产物导致放射检测器事件率增加，在放射安全和核安全领域这是一种干扰，需要准确模型来减少假报警

Method: 使用完整谱模型化技术，对NaI(Tl)探测器在户外水平测量的降雨期间放射谱进行定量模型化，通过线性模型拟合推断Pb-214和Bi-214活度浓度

Result: 得到了高频率(小于1分钟)的Pb-214和Bi-214源项活度浓度，并能估算雨水中后代产物浓度和表观年龄，实现了连续测量的全谱模型化

Conclusion: 该方法可在更短时间尺度上研究氯后代产物，为放射安全和核安全领域提供更准确的干扰模型，支持更有效的询问算法训练

Abstract: Gamma-ray detectors that are deployed outdoors experience increased event
rates during precipitation due to the attendant increase in Rn-222 progeny at
ground level. The increased radiation due to these decay products (Pb-214 and
Bi-214) has been studied for many decades in applications such as atmospheric
science and radiation protection. For those applications radon progeny
signatures are the signal of interest, while in the fields of radiological and
nuclear security and aerial radiological mapping they are a nuisance. When
searching for radiological contamination or missing sources, an analyst must
take precipitation into account to reduce false alarms, in addition to
accounting for static background signatures. To train advanced search
algorithms, an effort has been underway to generate synthetic gamma-ray event
data that represent a realistic urban area, including occasional rain events to
add to the realism. This manuscript describes an effort to analyze and model
gamma-ray spectra measured during rainfall by a NaI(Tl) detector located
outdoors in order to derive accurate source terms for Pb-214 and Bi-214 at a
high frequency (less than 1 minute). All known sources of background were
quantitatively modeled across the full gamma-ray spectrum, so that the Pb-214
and Bi-214 activity concentrations on the ground could be inferred from a
linear model fit to each spectrum. A physically motivated model was applied to
the data to further smooth the fits, which had the benefit of yielding
information about the concentrations of the progeny in rainwater and their
apparent age, making this the first time full-spectrum modeling has been used
for continuous measurements of radon progeny. This approach could lead to
studies of radon progeny on shorter timescales than previously possible.

TL;DR: NνDEx实验使用高压SeF₆气体时间投影室探测无中微子双β衰变，开发了包含离子迁移率计算、电场模拟、信号生成和拓扑重建的完整仿真框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为NνDEx实验开发一个全面的仿真框架，用于优化探测器设计、研究灵敏度和背景抑制能力，特别是利用两种离子载流子的漂移速度差异来实现触发无关的事件重建

Method: 使用密度泛函理论计算离子迁移率，COMSOL模拟电场分布，BxDecay0和Geant4生成事件，Garfield++模拟电荷传输和信号感应，基于漂移时间差和广度优先搜索进行3D径迹重建

Result: 计算得到SeF₅⁻和SeF₆⁻在SeF₆中的迁移率分别为0.444±0.133和0.430±0.129 cm²V⁻¹s⁻¹，建立了完整的仿真流程，提取了6个拓扑变量用于背景分离

Conclusion: 该仿真框架为NνDEx实验的设计优化和灵敏度研究提供了关键工具，通过拓扑变量分析和机器学习方法有望实现优异的信号背景分离能力

Abstract: The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta
decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection
chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be
formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables
trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy
resolution through direct charge collection.
  In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC.
The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were
calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding
values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$,
respectively.
  The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an
10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric
and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using
BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge
carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the
transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to
extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on
drift time differences and Breadth First search.
  To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were
extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection
criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This
simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and
sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 研究了GAGG:Ce闪锁器在极低温度（15 mK）下的性能，以应用于球载冷却探测器的内部反同期盾屋


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 球载冷却探测器需要在极低温度下运作的反同期盾屋，以减少太阳辐射带来的干扰

Method: 测试2种GAGG:Ce闪锁器在15 mK到4 K温度范围内的光输出和衰变时间性能

Result: 在4 K时性能与室温相似，但在2 K左右出现意外行为。综合性能让其适合在几开尔文温度下作为功能性反同期盾屋

Conclusion: GAGG:Ce闪锁器在几开尔文温度下具有可用性，为ASCENT等球载冷却探测器提供了内部反同期盾屋的可行解决方案

Abstract: The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for
usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be
exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This
radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something
which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard
X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier
tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators
placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be
placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and
expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope)
mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to
instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it
at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2
different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time.
Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were
found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be
similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2
K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around
these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials
will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.

### [5] [Real-time prediction of geomagnetic storms using Solar Orbiter as a far upstream solar wind monitor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13892)
*Emma E. Davies,Eva Weiler,Christian Möstl,Timothy S. Horbury,Helen O'Brien,Jean Morris,Alastair Crabtree*

Main category: physics.space-ph

TL;DR: 首次利用Solar Orbiter在2024年3月的远上游观测数据，实现了对日冕物质抛射(CME)磁场结构和地磁影响的实时预测，预测准确度高且提前时间大幅提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于L1点的预警时间不足1小时，需要开发更早的预警方法来提高地磁暴预测的准确性和提前时间

Method: 利用Solar Orbiter在0.53-0.60 AU处的远上游观测数据，预测CME磁场结构和地磁指数，即使与日地线存在10度纵向分离

Result: 预测的磁场结构与后续观测高度匹配，地磁指数预测提前7-15小时，大幅优于当前L1预警，成功捕捉地磁响应特征但低估了扰动条件下的风暴强度

Conclusion: 远上游航天器观测可提供高精度、长提前时间的预测，验证了实时上游太阳风测量对提升地磁预报准确性的重要价值，为未来专用空间天气任务提供关键验证

Abstract: We present the first real-time predictions of coronal mass ejection (CME)
magnetic structure and resulting geomagnetic impact at Earth for two events
using far-upstream observations from Solar Orbiter during March 2024. Despite
the large heliocentric distance between measurement at Solar Orbiter and L1
(0.53 and 0.60 AU), our predicted magnetic structures closely matched
subsequent observations. Geomagnetic index predictions were made in real-time
with 7 and 15 hour lead-times, presenting a large improvement over current
L1-based warning times of less than one hour. We successfully captured the
observed geomagnetic response profiles, although underestimated the intensity
of the storm during already disturbed conditions. Our results show that
predictions with high accuracy and actionable lead-times can be made with far
upstream spacecraft, even with longitudinal separations up to 10{\deg} from the
Sun-Earth line, over heliocentric distance ranges where radial evolution
effects dominate over longitudinal effects. Our findings demonstrate the
substantial value of real-time upstream solar wind measurements for enhancing
geomagnetic forecasting accuracy at Earth and provide critical validation for
future dedicated upstream space weather missions.

### [6] [Phase Transitions of Electromagnetically Charged Black Holes in Lovelock Gravity with Nonconstant Curvature Horizons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13221)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 提出了偶数维度下三阶Lovelock引力中最一般的带电黑洞解，研究了非恒定曲率视界对几何的影响，分析了热力学稳定性和相变行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高阶Lovelock引力理论中带电黑洞的精确解及其热力学性质，探索电磁场和Lovelock修正对黑洞相结构的影响。

Method: 构建三阶Lovelock引力中的电磁场方程，求解带电黑洞度规，分析近原点行为，研究热力学稳定性（正则系综和巨正则系综），识别相变类型。

Result: 发现电带电情况存在类时奇点（与不带电的类空奇点不同），确定了热力学稳定性条件，识别出一阶和二阶相变，包括类似van der Waals行为的中间尺寸黑洞不稳定性。

Conclusion: Lovelock修正和电磁场共同塑造了丰富的黑洞相结构，守恒荷影响黑洞蒸发和稳定化过程，揭示了高阶引力理论中带电黑洞的复杂热力学行为。

Abstract: We present the most general class of charged black hole solutions in
third-order Lovelock gravity within even-dimensional spacetimes in the presence
of an electromagnetic field. These solutions feature nonconstant-curvature
horizons that affect geometry when n>=8. The near-origin behavior of the metric
reveals a timelike singularity for electrically charged cases, in contrast to
the spacelike singularity found in the uncharged case. We investigate
thermodynamic stability in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles. In
the grand canonical ensemble, stability is determined by the positivity of both
the Hessian determinant and the temperature. In the canonical ensemble, the
sign of the heat capacity governs stability. We identify both first- and
second-order phase transitions, including a van der Waals-like behavior
characterized by instability at intermediate black hole sizes. Our results
reveal a rich phase structure influenced by Lovelock corrections and
electromagnetic fields, and demonstrate how conserved charges affect black hole
evaporation and stabilization.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 在(2+1)维平面宇宙中验证普遍二点律(GSL)，发现Fischler-Susskind(FS)熵增上限在收缩宇宙中与GSL不兼容，而Hubble熵增(HE)上限在扩张宇宙中与GSL一致，量子效应在某些收缩情况下可以协调两者。MCMC分析确认了模型参数的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验普遍二点律(GSL)在低维度(2+1)维宇宙边界形弊中的有效性，对比两种主要的熵增上限(FS和HE)在扩张和收缩宇宙中的表现，包括量子效应的影响。

Method: 采用边界形弊热力学框架，理论分析FS和HE熵增上限在负宇宙常数(2+1)维宇宙中的行为，考虑量子熵增纠正。使用MCMC方法分析最近的BAO、CC和Hubble参数数据集来约束模型参数。

Result: FS熵增上限在收缩(2+1)维宇宙中与GSL本质不兼容，无论空间曲率或奇异物质内容，量子纠正也无法解决。HE上限在扩张宇宙中与GSL一致，在某些收缩情况下通过量子效应可以协调。MCMC分析显示宇宙常数参数ψ在所有探针中保持稳定。

Conclusion: HE熵增上限是低维度宇宙边界形弊中更稳健的约束候选者，FS上限存在明显的局限性。这些结果不仅明确了GSL在(2+1)维设置中的状态，为未来高精度宇宙学数据检验熵增上限提供了框架。

Abstract: We investigate the validity of the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of
thermodynamics in a $(2+1)$-dimensional holographic cosmological model with a
negative cosmological constant. Adopting a horizon thermodynamics framework, we
examine two prominent entropy bounds, the Fischler--Susskind (FS) bound and the
Hubble Entropy (HE) bound, in both expanding and contracting universes,
including the effects of quantum entropy corrections. Our theoretical analysis
shows that the FS bound is intrinsically incompatible with the GSL in
contracting $(2+1)$-dimensional universes, regardless of spatial curvature or
exotic matter content, and that this incompatibility persists even when quantum
corrections are considered. In contrast, the HE bound is consistent with the
GSL in expanding universes under classical conditions and can also be
reconciled in certain contracting scenarios when quantum effects are included.
To complement the theoretical study, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic
Chronometer (CC), and Hubble parameter datasets to constrain the model
parameters. The best-fit results reveal good cross-dataset consistency, with
the cosmological constant parameter $\psi$ remaining stable across all probes.
These findings identify the HE bound as a more robust candidate for holographic
constraints in lower-dimensional cosmology, while demonstrating the limitations
of the FS bound. Our results not only clarify the status of the GSL in
$(2+1)$-dimensional settings but also provide a framework for testing entropy
bounds with future high-precision cosmological data.

*Naman Kumar*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 在任意维度中通过几何-分析方法证明了黑洞的反等周不等式，证明阿德斯-达西尔空间中的环形球在给定体积下最大化面积（因此最大化熵）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究黑洞在扩展相空形式中的反等周不等式，探索引力在黑洞视界面反等周性质中的作用

Method: 使用欧几里得重力作用量进行分析证明，并通过1+1+2时空分解的几何论证支持，利用引力聚焦和Sherif-Dunsby刚性定理

Result: 证明了在阿德斯-达西尔空间中，环形球是在给定体积下面积最大的极值表面，因此也是最大熵表面

Conclusion: 反等周不等式的反转是由爱因斯坦方程组织的曲朗背景结构导致的，强调了引力在黑洞视界面反等周性质中的关键作用

Abstract: We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black
holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach.
The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to
be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism.
Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of
given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space
maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported
by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational
focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the
Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be
isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal
surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the
reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of
the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of
gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS
space.

TL;DR: 基于广义质量-视界熵的扩展宇宙学模型，通过SNIa、CC、BAO和SH0ES数据约束，结果显示与标准ΛCDM模型拟合相当，但模型选择轻微偏好宇宙学常数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展Bekenstein-Hawking面积定律，构建与克劳修斯方程一致的质量-视界关系，探索引力-热力学猜想下的修正弗里德曼方程

Method: 使用Ia型超新星(SNIa)、宇宙计时器(CC)、重子声学振荡(BAO包括DESI DR2)观测数据，结合SH0ES距离阶梯先验，通过四种数据集组合约束扩展熵模型

Result: 扩展熵场景对数据的拟合略好或统计相当，但AIC模型选择轻微偏好宇宙学常数；ΛCDM极限在约1σ范围内，当前数据未显示显著偏离标准宇宙学

Conclusion: 虽然广义质量-视界熵框架提供了可行的扩展，但现有观测数据仍支持标准ΛCDM模型，未发现显著偏离宇宙学常数的证据

Abstract: A generalized mass-to-horizon entropy has recently been proposed as an
extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, derived from a modified
mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius
equation. Within the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, this entropy
formulation yields modified Friedmann equations, which recover the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the appropriate limit of the model's two free
parameters. In the present study, we constrain this framework using
observations from TypeIa supernovae (SNIa), cosmic chronometers (CC) and baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO, including DESI~DR2), together with the SH0ES
distance-ladder prior on $H_0$, across four combinations of data sets. Although
the extended entropic scenario yields a slightly better, or statistically
comparable, fit to the data, model selection via the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) mildly favors the cosmological constant as the dark energy
candidate. Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM limit lies within $\sim 1\sigma$ of our
constraints, indicating no significant deviation from standard cosmology with
current data.

Motivation: 解决传统黑洞模型的曲率奇点和信息/防火墙悖论问题，提供观测上可验证的CPT对称替代方案。

Method: 在事件视界施加特定边界条件，分析黑洞镜的准正规模谱特性，研究其反射率的普适行为，并利用极端质量比旋进系统探测引力波回波信号。

Result: 黑洞镜的准正规模谱与传统黑洞存在根本差异（禁止纯入射模式），反射率由玻尔兹曼因子精确给出且不依赖自由参数，表现出普适性。

Conclusion: 引力波回波的明确探测将为区分黑洞镜反射边界与传统黑洞吸收视界提供有力证据，极端质量比旋进是理想探测途径，有望挑战经典范式并革新时空理解。

Abstract: The existence of curvature singularities and the information and firewall
paradoxes are significant problems for the conventional black hole model. The
black mirror hypothesis provides a CPT-symmetric alternative to the classical
description of black hole, offering a novel solution to these long-standing
issues. We show that classical black holes can, in principle, be distinguished
from black mirrors observationally, by using gravitational waves. The principal
challenge is to identify a unique, testable signature of the black mirror's
reflective horizon that can be detected by current or future observatories. The
horizon singularity of the black mirror model necessitates that no energy flux
is propagated beyond the horizon, which can be described effectively by
imposing specific boundary conditions at the event horizon. Our analysis
demonstrates that the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the black mirror is
fundamentally different from that of classical black holes, as purely ingoing
modes are forbidden. Moreover, we show that the reflectivity of the black
mirror does not depend on any free parameter; it is given precisely by the
Boltzmann factor, which is independent of the dissipation parameter, indicating
a universal behaviour regardless of the specific underlying quantum dynamics at
the horizon. A definitive detection of the predicted gravitational wave echoes
would provide compelling evidence distinguishing the reflective boundary of a
black mirror from the perfectly absorbing horizon of a classical black hole.
Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are ideal probes for this test, as their
long-duration signals allow for the secular accumulation of these faint echoes,
offering a concrete pathway to challenge the classical paradigm and
revolutionise our understanding of spacetime.

Abstract: We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real
scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing
on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct
classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin --
connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one}
with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze
both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that
the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can
reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic
equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological
signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness
limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also
examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field
and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's
ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular
momentum.

existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency
approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian
features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to
eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional
time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time
extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3)
implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial
calculations. Our model can be used to de-noise long-duration signals, which
include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved
sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating
neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications
that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time
and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.

Method: 通过研究完整相对论中的非线性相互作用，分析四模和三模相互作用机制，并证明其导致的共振和反阻尼不稳定性。

Abstract: Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular
astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to
black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades -
mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance
of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black
hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such
interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show
that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode
interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel
inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities.
This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized
perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent''
transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity,
whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the
impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which
can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer
scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear
gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing
gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme
regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear
gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Data from ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO contain many
types of noise. Glitches are short bursts of non-Gaussian noise that may hinder
our ability to identify or analyse gravitational-wave signals. They may have
instrumental or environmental origins, and new types of glitches may appear
following detector changes. The Gravity Spy project studies glitches and their
origins, combining insights from volunteers on the community-science Zooniverse
platform with machine learning. Here, we study volunteer proposals for new
glitch classes, discussing links between these glitches and the state of the
detectors, and examining how new glitch classes pose a challenge for
machine-learning classification. Our results demonstrate how Zooniverse
empowers non-experts to make discoveries, and the importance of monitoring
changes in data quality in the LIGO detectors.

Conclusion: 该黑洞模型为Kerr范式提供了物理一致且观测可行的扩展，对近视界面量子过程和普通相对论之外的重力测试具有潜在意义

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de
Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the
shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at
finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the
spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are
analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective
charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational
constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The
angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the
parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key
roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge.
Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow
radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and
nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate
that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally
viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for
near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.

Conclusion: 重力子质量和电荷在非线性电磁场黑洞背景下对渐近模式有重要影响，为理论物理研究提供了重要线索。

Abstract: Using the precise Leaver method and time-domain integration, we analyze the
quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of massive neutral and charged scalar
fields in the background of a charged, asymptotically flat black hole in the
presence of Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. We show that as the
field mass increases, the damping rate decreases significantly, approaching
arbitrarily long-lived states known as quasi-resonances. However, these modes
cannot be identified in time-domain profiles due to the dominance of asymptotic
tails in this regime, which decay slowly and exhibit oscillations with a
power-law envelope. We observe that a larger field charge leads to a
significantly higher quality factor, as it increases the oscillation frequency
while reducing the damping rate.

Conclusion: AGN环境是产生中等质量黑洞合并的可行途径，GW231123事件可能来自动力学形成的高代黑洞合并

Abstract: The recent binary black hole (BBH) merger GW231123 consisted of the merger of
two intermediate mass black holes (IMBH) which appear to have large spin
magnitudes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are very promising environments for
IMBH mergers and growth due to high escape velocities. Here we demonstrate how
GW231123 can be produced in the AGN channel. Using the McFACTS code, we explore
the impact of various choices of the black hole (BH) initial mass function
(IMF) on predicted mass and spin magnitudes of BBH mergers from the AGN
dynamical formation channel. By integrating the likelihood function for
GW231123 with the detectable BBH population predicted from AGN using McFACTS,
we demonstrate that GW231123 is consistent with a dynamical BBH merger from the
AGN channel. We also postulate that the masses and spin magnitudes of GW231123
are most consistent with a merger of fourth and third generation BHs, for most
choices of a segregated BH IMF and AGN lifetime.

depending upon the metric and its Riemann tensor, together with arbitrary order
covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor. Then an equality linking the
Lagrangian density with the divergence of a vector field is proposed under a
constraint on the Lagrangian density. As a significant application, we further
obtain an equality to establish the relationship between the divergence of a
vector field and the Lagrangian density consisting of the contraction of the
product for metric tensors with the product of the Riemann tensors and the
arbitrary order covariant derivatives of the Riemann tensor.

Conclusion: 标量场与曲率的不同耦合方式对黑洞水动的谱特征和动力学特性有重要影响，在高频段这种影响更为显著

Abstract: This work presents a comparative analysis of the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of
scalar field perturbations in the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole
spacetime, focusing on two different non-minimal curvature couplings: in the
first case the scalar field is coupled to the Ricciscalar while in the second
the field's derivatives are coupled to the Einstein tensor. These couplings are
important in the cosmological modified gravity models and low energy effects of
perturbative quantum gravity. It is shown that though the QNM spectra in two
models are approximately the same at low overtone numbers, particularly at
fundamental modes, they behave characteristically at higher overtones.
Time-domain profiles confirm that while the decay rates are predominantly
controlled by the near-horizon physics, the oscillation frequencies distinctly
reflect the nature of the curvature couplings. In brief, the kind of
scalar-interaction affects the spectral and dynamical characteristics of
perturbations especially in the high-frequency regime.

Abstract: A scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidate would induce oscillatory
motion of freely falling test masses via its coupling to Standard Model fields.
Such oscillations would create an observable Doppler shift of light exchanged
between the test masses, and in particular would be visible in space-based
gravitational waves (GW) detectors, such as LISA. While this kind of detection
has been proposed multiple times in the recent years, we numerically
investigate if it is possible to extract a scalar ULDM signal in a space-based
GW detector, and in particular how to differentiate such a signal from a GW
signal. Using one year of realistic orbits for the LISA spacecrafts and
Bayesian methods, we find that LISA will indeed be able to discriminate between
the two signals.

Conclusion: EFT重力修正导致黑洞微涡特性显著变化，尤其是谱稳定性出现复杂非单调行为，为高级重力理论黑洞研究提供重要线索。

Abstract: We study the linear perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole
corrected by dimension-6 terms in EFT of gravity. The solution is
asymptotically flat and characterized by two parameters -- a mass parameter $M$
and a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$ related to the EFT length scale
$l$, and the perturbation equation incorporates a velocity factor which is not
constant. The quasinormal modes (QNMs) and time-domain waveforms are studied
within the hyperboloidal framework. This approach reproduces the breakdown of
the isospectrality and reveals that higher overtones are more sensitive to
$\varepsilon$. As for the time domain, the mismatch function is introduced and
found to scale as $\varepsilon^2$, which demonstrates that the waveform is
stable as $\varepsilon$ varies. Finally, a velocity-dependent energy norm is
employed to compute the pseudospectrum and characterize the migration of the
QNM spectrum. We further define a quantity $\epsilon_c$ that describes the
magnitude of the instability of a QNM spectrum. Our analysis reveals that the
dependence of $\epsilon_c$ on $\varepsilon$ is complicated -- it may increase,
decrease or even be non-monotonic.

Abstract: This study explores the application of complexity factor within the context
of Rastall gravity, exploring its implications on a static spacetime admitting
spherical symmetry associated with anisotropic fluids under an electromagnetic
field. The field equations are derived for a static charged sphere that
provides a foundational framework for analyzing gravitational effects in this
non-conserved theory. The mass function is formulated by incorporating both
fluid and geometric parameters, offering insights into how mass distribution
affects spacetime curvature. Through orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann
tensor, a set of scalar quantities is obtained, referred to the structure
scalars, which serve as indicators of celestial complexity. One specific scalar
is then specified as the complexity factor, i.e., $\mathbb{Y}_{TF}$,
facilitating further analysis on its role in characterizing complex systems.
The presence of unknowns in gravitational equations necessitates the imposition
of constraints to facilitate their solution. To address this,
$\mathbb{Y}_{TF}=0$ alongside three distinct conditions are employed which
yield diverse stellar models. A comprehensive graphical analysis is conducted
using multiple values of the Rastall and charge parameters. Notably, the
findings of this study align with those predicted by Einstein's theory. More
appealingly, the Rastall theory demonstrates its superiority in the presence of
charge under model 2 when it is compared with the general theory of relativity.

Abstract: We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves
from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release
(DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a
common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz
gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves.
Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in
the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\%
credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive
to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up
to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and
200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times
better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based
on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a
key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of
nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.

Abstract: In this paper, we perform small perturbations around the circular timelike
orbit in the equatorial plane of the Horndeski rotating black hole, and analyze
the effects of Horndeski hair on the three fundamental frequencies of the
epicyclic oscillations. Since this operation can model the quasiperiodic
oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the surrounding accretion disc, we then employ
the MCMC simulation to fit the theoretical results with three QPO events,
including GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226 and H1743-322, and constrain the
characteristic radius $r$, black hole mass $M$ and spinning parameter $a$, and
the Horndeski hair parameter $h$. Our constraint on the Horndeski hair
parameter is much tighter than QPOs simulation from the existed accretion
models, suggesting slight deviation from classical Kerr black hole.

Abstract: Keyhole-induced (KH) porosity, which arises from unstable vapor cavity
dynamics under excessive laser energy input, remains a significant challenge in
laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). This study presents an integrated experimental
and data-driven framework using airborne acoustic emission (AE) to achieve
high-resolution quantification of KH porosity. Experiments conducted on an LPBF
system involved in situ acquisition of airborne AE and ex situ porosity imaging
via X-ray computed tomography (XCT), synchronized spatiotemporally through
photodiode signals with submillisecond precision. We introduce KHLineNum, a
spatially resolved porosity metric defined as the number of KH pores per unit
scan length, which serves as a physically meaningful indicator of the severity
of KH porosity in geometries and scanning strategies. Using AE scalogram data
and scan speed, we trained a lightweight convolutional neural network to
predict KHLineNum with millisecond-scale temporal resolution, achieving an
R-squared value exceeding 0.8. Subsequent analysis identified the 35-45 kHz
frequency band of AE as particularly informative, consistent with known KH
oscillations. Beyond defect quantification, the framework also enables
AE-driven direct inference of KH regime boundaries on the power-velocity
process map, offering a noninvasive and scalable component to labor-intensive
post-process techniques such as XCT. We believe this framework advances
AE-based monitoring in LPBF, providing a pathway toward improved quantifiable
defect detection and process control.

Abstract: Metastructures with band gaps provide a new solution for the torsional
vibration attenuation in shaft systems, while tunable band gaps remain
challenging, typically relying on additional physical fields or complex
assembly processes. In this study, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft with
self-locking gear (SLG) resonators is proposed, where a simple gear-shifting
mechanism replaces complex tuning methods to achieve low-frequency torsional
vibration suppression in tunable frequency ranges. First, as the key components
of the SLG resonator, six inner curved beams are designed to provide precisely
tunable torsional stiffness of the resonator through their deformed shapes
controlled by shifting the gear teeth on the edge of the resonator. Also, based
on the gear-shifting mechanism, the SLG resonator achieves resonant frequency
modulation and opens tunable low-frequency torsional band gaps consistent with
theoretical predictions. Then, the SLG resonators are periodically attached to
a uniform shaft to construct a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft, whose dynamic
response is obtained using numerical simulations to evaluate its torsional wave
attenuation performance. Finally, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft prototype
is fabricated and experiments are carried out to study the propagation
characteristics of torsional waves therein. Through the consistency observed
among theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experimental results,
the gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft is found to exhibit excellent attenuation
performance in the tunable low-frequency band gaps. Therefore, the proposed
gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft paves a new way for low-frequency torsional

Abstract: This work investigates the direct magnetoelectric effect in thin-film lab
scale composite heterostructures comprising a 100 nm thick piezoelectric
Sc0.4Al0.6N (ScAlN) and a magnetostrictive Ni with 100-200 nm thickness,
fabricated on Si/SiO2 substrates. The films are patterned into square pillar
arrays with lateral dimensions down to 500 nm x 500 nm. Vibrating sample
magnetometry (VSM) measurements reveal in-plane magnetic anisotropy in the Ni
films, attributed to strain induced by the underlying ScAlN layer.
Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry imaging confirms the formation of magnetic
domains at remanence in polycrystalline Ni when patterned in sub-microscale
structures. Capacitance measurements reveal a ScAlN dielectric constant at the
device level consistent with unpatterned thin films, confirming the
preservation of electrical integrity at the sub-microscale. The direct
magnetoelectric effect is demonstrated through quasi-static charge measurements
under applied out-of-plane DC magnetic fields, yielding equivalent open-circuit
voltages up to 1.17 mV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微颗粒实验中控制颗粒与基板粘附是关键挑战，需要克服表面粘附力才能实现微颗粒悬浮捕获

Method: 研究基于化学、物理和物理化学改性的硅表面工程方法，测量脱离力并与水接触角关联分析

Result: 开发出使平均脱离力降低3倍以上、50%颗粒移动力降低6倍以上的表面处理方法，疏水表面表现出更低粘附

Conclusion: 疏水表面工程可有效降低微颗粒粘附力，为需要低粘附的微颗粒实验提供可靠技术支撑

Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling
their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle
initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces
to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By
engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion
force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we
investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on
chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon.
We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation
between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that
hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop
surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor
of three, or the force at which 50% of particles move by more than a factor of
six, the compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable
reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments
requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.

TL;DR: 通过内部正反馈机制，在InGaAs/InP n-p-n三极管中实现了达到150%/K的可电压调节的电阻温度系数(TCR)，远超传统材料的5%/K限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半导体材料（如氪化镁、非晶硅）的TCR值在300K附近一般低于5%/K，限制了在自主系统、高精度温度传感和神经线绘计算等领域的应用潜力

Method: 利用两端InGaAs/InP n-p-n三极管，通过内部相干运动子反馈机制实现。流泰增益来自于温度依赖性三极管增益和雪崩乘法的协同作用，形成再生正反馈循环

Result: 实现了达到150%/K的高TCR值，这是传统材料的30倍，且TCR值可通过偏置电压进行调节

Conclusion: 这项工作呈现了通过器件工程超越材料级别物理限制的潜力，为高性能温度感应和相关应用开启了新方向

Abstract: The temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) is one of the most
fundamental properties of a material. Semiconductor materials exhibiting high
TCR are promising candidates for applications in high-resolution thermal
imaging for autonomous systems, high-precision temperature sensing, and
neuromorphic computing. However, the TCR magnitude is typically below 5%/K near
300 K for thermal imaging materials, such as vanadium oxide and amorphous
silicon. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of feedback in electronic
circuits, we demonstrate a voltage-tunable TCR of up to 150%/K near 300 K in a
two-terminal InGaAs/InP n-p-n transistor, enabled by an internal coherent
carrier feedback mechanism. In this device, current amplification arises from a
synergistic interplay between temperature-dependent transistor gain and
avalanche multiplication. Carriers amplified at the emitter-base junction via
the transistor effect are injected into the collector-base junction, where
avalanche multiplication generates additional carriers. These excess carriers
are then fed back to the emitter-base junction, triggering further transistor
amplification. This regenerative positive feedback loop results in a high and
bias-tunable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR). This work reveals the
potential of device engineering in overcoming the fundamental material-level
physical limits of temperature properties.

### [31] [VIPCALs: A fully-automated calibration pipeline for VLBI data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13282)
*Diego Álvarez-Ortega,Carolina Casadio,Felix M. Pötzl,Avinash Kumar,Michael Janssen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: VIPCALs是一个全自动的VLBI连续谱数据校准流水线，无需人工干预即可完成复杂的数据校准工作，显著降低了VLBI科学的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLBI技术虽然能实现亚毫角秒分辨率，但需要复杂的手动后相关校准来修正各种误差。现有流水线大多半自动化且依赖用户监督，无法满足大规模项目需求。

Method: 基于Python和ParselTongue实现，完全复现标准AIPS校准工作流程，包括自动参考天线选择、校准源识别等功能，以无监督模式运行。

Result: 在1000个SMILE项目源的VLBA数据测试中，成功校准了955个源，91%以上数据集在至少一半尝试中成功拟合条纹，中位校准可见度比为0.87，平均处理时间低于10分钟/数据集。

Conclusion: VIPCALs实现了稳健、可重复的全自动VLBI连续谱数据校准，显著提高了效率和大规模项目的可行性。

Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can
achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often
manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and
propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI
arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and
existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision.
We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for
continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge
of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and
heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives
such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python
using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow
in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline
also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification,
and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a
representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to
1 000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated
observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over
91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in
at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated
visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing
time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and
scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated
calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier
for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.

TL;DR: NIRSpec仪器上的微快门阵列容易出现电短路问题，导致红外辉光影响观测数据。论文总结了两年多来的短路缓解操作经验，包括识别受影响快门、最小化掩蔽范围以及恢复已消失短路的复用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JWST的NIRSpec仪器使用微快门阵列进行多目标光谱观测，但该阵列容易发生电短路，产生红外辉光破坏观测数据，浪费宝贵的观测时间，需要有效的缓解策略。

Method: 通过操作经验改进技术程序和决策流程，包括及时识别受影响快门、精确掩蔽相应行列以防止未来激活，并在短路消失后解除掩蔽以恢复复用能力。

Result: 经过两年多的运行，开发出了成熟的短路缓解操作策略，能够最小化掩蔽范围的同时可靠抑制短路影响，并成功恢复了部分因短路而损失的复用能力。

Conclusion: 为NIRSpec开发的微快门阵列短路缓解操作策略不仅保障了JWST的科学产出，也为未来任务（如宜居世界观测站）中类似技术的应用提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: The Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) is one of four science instruments
on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which began routine operations
in July 2022. As JWST's primary spectroscopic instrument for faint, distant
targets, NIRSpec plays a central role in several of the mission's core science
goals. Its signature multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) mode enables the
simultaneous acquisition of spectra for up to a hundred targets across the
field of view, using a micro-shutter array (MSA) comprised of nearly 250,000
individually addressable micro-electromechanical shutters.
  The MSA is susceptible to occasional electrical shorts, which produce
unwanted infrared glow in MOS exposures, rendering them unusable and wasting
valuable observatory time. Mitigation requires promptly identifying the
affected shutter(s) and masking the corresponding row(s) or column(s) to
prevent future activation. However, masking shutters unnecessarily reduces
NIRSpec's multiplexing capacity, so it is important to minimize the extent of
masking while reliably suppressing the short's effects.
  More than two years of operations have informed refinements in technical
procedures and operational decision-making around short mitigation. This
experience also supports new efforts to identify and unmask previously affected
rows or columns where shorts have since disappeared, enabling the recovery of
multiplexing capacity that would otherwise remain lost.
  As MSA technology matures toward use in future missions such as the Habitable
Worlds Observatory, operational strategies developed for NIRSpec remain
relevant beyond JWST. This paper provides an overview of MSA shorts mitigation
operations, summarizes shorts observed since the completion of commissioning,
and describes the evolving contingency procedures that have enabled continued
science productivity from this unique payload.

Conclusion: CCOR日冕仪系列为空间天气预报提供了新的紧凑型观测工具，将在GOES-U和SWFO-L1卫星上持续提供日冕观测数据。

Abstract: The CCOR Compact Coronagraph is a series of two operational solar
coronagraphs sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA). They were designed, built, and tested by the U.S. Naval Research
Laboratory (NRL). The CCORs will be used by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction
Center to detect and track Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and predict the Space
Weather. CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental
Satellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy
Space Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space
Weather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch
in the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs
are white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar
to the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while
CCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for
CCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740
nm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the
forecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation
coronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO),
CCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single
multi-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a
substantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example,
but with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, we review the
science that the CCORs will capitalize on for the purpose of operational space
weather prediction. We give a description of the driving requirements and
accommodations, and provide details on the instrument design. In the end,
information on ground processing and data levels is provided.

Abstract: The Resolve soft X-ray spectrometer is the high spectral resolution
microcalorimeter spectrometer for the XRISM mission. In the beam of Resolve
there is a filter wheel containing \xray{} filters. In the beam also is an
active calibration source (the modulated X-ray source (MXS) that can provide
pulsed \xray s to facilitate gain calibration.
  The filter wheel consists of six filter positions. Two open positions, one
$^{55}$Fe source to aid in spectrometer characterization during the
commissioning phase, and three transmission filters: a neutral density filter,
an optical blocking filter, and a beryllium filter.
  The X-ray intensity, pulse period, and pulse separation of a MXS are highly
configurable. Furthermore, the switch--on time is synchronized with the
spacecraft's internal clock to give accurate start and end times of the pulses.
  One of the issues raised during ground testing was the susceptibility of a
MXS at high voltage to ambient light. Although measures were taken to mitigate
the light leak, the efficacy of those measures must be verified in orbit. Along
with an overview of issues raised during ground testing, this article will
discuss the calibration source and the filter performance in--flight and
compare with the transmission curves present in the Resolve calibration
database.

Abstract: Neutrino astronomy is a vibrant field of study in astrophysics, offering
unique insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena. The combination
of a low cross section and zero electromagnetic charge ensure that a neutrino
retains most information about its original source while traversing the
universe. On the other hand, these low cross sections, combined with a reduced
flux at higher energies, make the neutrino one of the most elusive particles to
detect in the standard model. The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland
(RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice
sheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced
by the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux
forces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured
data being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations. Hence, a sophisticated
and robust filter is needed to differentiate between neutrino-like signals and
noise. In this contribution we present the current work on the development of
such a filter, based on a convolutional neural network architecture. The
network employed uses real RNO-G data and simulated neutrino signals to
categorize measured data as noise or neutrino-like events.
