An understanding of the impact of nuisance effects\nsuch as noise on such field-level frameworks, however, still remains elusive.\nIn this work we conduct a systematic investigation into the efficacy of DL\ninference from noisy Ly{\\alpha} forest spectra. Building upon our previous,\nproof-of-concept framework (Nayak et al. 2024) for pure spectra, we constructed\nand trained a ResNet neural network using labeled mock data from hydrodynamical\nsimulations with a range of noise levels to optimally compress noisy spectra\ninto a novel summary statistic that is exclusively sensitive to the power-law\ntemperature-density relation of the intergalactic medium. We fit a Gaussian\nmixture surrogate with 23 components through our labels and summaries to\nestimate the joint data-parameter distribution for likelihood free inference,\nin addition to performing inference with a Gaussian likelihood. The posterior\ncontours in the two cases agree well with each other. We compared the precision\nand accuracy of our posterior constraints with a combination of two human\ndefined summaries (the 1D power spectrum and PDF of the Ly{\\alpha}\ntransmission) that have been corrected for noise, over a wide range of\ncontinuum-to-noise ratios (CNR) in the likelihood case. We found a gain in\nprecision in terms of posterior contour area with our pipeline over the said\ncombination of 65% (at a CNR of 20 per 6 km/s) to 112% (at 200 per 6 km/s).\nWhile the improvement in posterior precision is not as large as in the\nnoiseless case, these results indicate that DL still remains a powerful tool\nfor inference even with noisy, real-world datasets."}

This drives in part the desire to\nconstruct ever-larger telescopes and interferometer arrays and to observe at\nshorter wavelength to lower the diffraction limit of angular resolution.\nAlternatively, one can aim to overcome the diffraction limit by extracting more\ninformation from a single telescope's aperture. A promising way to do this is\nspatial mode-based imaging, which projects focal-plane field onto a set of\nspatial modes before detection, retaining focal-plane phase information crucial\nat small angular scales but typically lost in intensity imaging. However, the\npractical implementation of mode-based imaging in astronomy from the ground has\nbeen challenged by atmospheric turbulence. Here, we present the first on-sky\ndemonstration of a subdiffraction-limited, mode-based measurement using a\nphotonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometer installed on the SCExAO instrument at\nthe Subaru Telescope. We introduce a novel calibration strategy that mitigates\ntime-varying wavefront error and misalignment effects, leveraging\nsimultaneously recorded focal-plane images and using a spectral-differential\ntechnique that self-calibrates the data.

Motivated by the recent proposal that a black\nhole's information load can alter its classical response to small\nperturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal\nphenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole\nmerger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a\nBayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal\nmodes and obtain a lower bound $\\log_{10}p \\gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how\nthe gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the\ncritical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high\nsignal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\\log_{10}p\n\\gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results\ndisfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden\neffect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors."}

It is based on the postulations\nthat quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints,\nrepresent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift\ngenerate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses\ntoward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the\nscale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar,\nvector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of\ntime for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit,\nthe tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra\nmodes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the\nconstraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over\nall length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave\nvector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations\nwith large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range\ninteractions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them\nundetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for\nthe cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and\nadiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space\ndimension."}

We find that\none can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave\nfunction must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly\nsuggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface\nthat crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must\nkeep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the\nevent horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single\ncoherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a\nsuperposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a\nhorizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum\nmacroscopic object.
