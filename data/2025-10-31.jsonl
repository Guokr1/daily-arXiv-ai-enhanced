A series of\ntests were performed to investigate the ability of a saturated dryer to\npreferentially adsorb heavy water vapor. The design of passive tritiated\ncontrol systems is feasible by utilizing a dryer's ability to preferentially\ntrap heavier isotopologues of water. This work investigates this displacement\nphenomenon and the effect of the heavy water humidity on the dryers\nperformance. Significant displacement was observed when a humid stream of heavy\nwater was diverted through a dryer pre-saturated with light water, as indicated\nby changes in the partial pressures of $D_2O$ and $H_2O$. After the capture of\nheavy water in the bed, the subsequent rise in $D_2O$ partial pressure depended\non the humidity of heavy water in the gas stream. Higher humidity values lead\nto faster and steeper mass transfer profiles in the dryer, which could be\nempirically fit with sigmoid curves."}

Originally developed within the CYGNO\nprogram for directional dark matter searches, the system employs a scientific\nCMOS (sCMOS) camera and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to collect secondary\nscintillation light produced during charge amplification. A prototype with a\ncylindrical active volume (radius 3.7 cm, height 5 cm) was tested at the\nINAF--IAPS calibration facility (Rome, Tor Vergata) to assess sensitivity to\nlow-energy electron directionality. We fully reconstruct electrons in the 10-60\nkeV range, obtain angular resolutions as good as 15{\\deg}, and infer modulation\nfactors up to 0.9. These first results demonstrate robust photoelectron\ntracking at tens of keV with strong modulation, indicating that\nphotoelectric-effect polarimetry can be extended to higher energies. This\ncapability is promising for rapid transients (GRBs, solar flares) and would\nbroaden the astrophysical reach of X-ray polarimetry."}

[1]. All spin sectors -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial\n-- are analyzed to obtain the corresponding features. For particle creation, we\nconsider massless bosonic and fermionic perturbations to determine the\nrespective particle densities. Analytical expressions for the greybody factors\nare derived, with suitable approximations for the tensor and spinorial cases.\nThe absorption cross section is computed numerically, and using the\nStefan-Boltzmann law, we estimate the black hole evaporation lifetime. The\nassociated energy and particle emission rates are also discussed, along with\nthe correspondence between quasinormal modes and greybody factors."}

Prepared for submission to MNRAS", "summary": "The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have\nbecome the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in\ncurved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable\nreconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining\nstrong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the\nGRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high\nmagnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as\nelectron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an\nexplicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the\nstrong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be\ncrucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid\nmodel which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an\narbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared\nelectromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus\nallowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model\nmay be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the\nrelativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered\nin the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity.\nWe present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid\nequations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD\nequations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our\nmultifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the\nmagnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate\nsignificantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both\nblack hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either\naccuracy or stability."}

Furthermore, this\nmodel can contribute to accounting for the lack of power anomaly in the low $l$\nangular power spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Using the\nlatest data from the Planck (2018) collaboration, we establish observational\nconstraints on the model parameters, which produce a characteristic low-$\\ell$\nsuppression in the cosmic microwave background spectrum.
