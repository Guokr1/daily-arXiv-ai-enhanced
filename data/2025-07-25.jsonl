SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to\naccommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.\nSPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated\nf-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not\nonly sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming\ndark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily\nmodulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic\nhigh-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching\nsingle-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of\nEu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype\ndetector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier\nchain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\\pm$7 electrons in silicon\ntest samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a\ndemonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment\nin a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.\nFinally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of\nathermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background\nenvironments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing\nperformance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our\nultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR\nprovides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing\nwith material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass\nrange of dark matter parameter space."}

To mitigate the effects\nof electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction\nperformance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons\nunder 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z\nreconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region\nand from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes.

These models allow black holes to exist\nwhile having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been\nshown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an\nastrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that\nsubstantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole\nthermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of\nprimordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\\,Sitter and\nMinkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these\nmetrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands\"), the black hole\ntemperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black\nhole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic\ngamma ray background."}

The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical\nsystem, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate\nvariables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or\nquantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general\nrelativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to\nnon-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism\nthrough various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians\ndescribing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with\nlinear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians\nthat reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to\nrenormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the\nsingularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free\nblack-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning\nfrom a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside\nSchwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both\nsemi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure\nof self-gravitating compact objects and black holes."}

Specifically, it is known that at the foam\nlevel, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the\nparticular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective\ndynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the\nlatter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can\nimmediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of\nthe topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this\nTDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic\nevolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We\nconfront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with\nPantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations\n(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model\nselection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but\nstatistically significant preference over $\\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we\nshow that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe."}

Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of\nsecond-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different\ncombinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a\ncomparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying\ntime spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly\ncorrelated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the\nlow-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are\nnearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,\nwhere the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,\nshorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate\nwaveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,\nconfigurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the\nMichelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation\neffects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and\nanalysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become\neffectively equivalent.
