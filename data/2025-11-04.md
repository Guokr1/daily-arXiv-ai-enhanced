TL;DR: 盖亚任务通过10年观测创建了史上最大的变源分类星表，使用机器学习技术处理超过20亿颗恒星的时间序列数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盖亚任务观测了超过20亿颗恒星，产生了海量的时间序列数据，需要有效方法来提取其中的科学价值，特别是探测和分类变源。

Method: 使用机器学习技术进行交叉匹配、变源探测和变源分类，处理盖亚任务提供的天体测量、测光、分光测光和光谱测量数据。

Result: 创建了有史以来覆盖整个天球的最大分类变源星表，探测到从秒到年时间尺度变化的多种天体。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法成功处理了盖亚任务的大规模时间序列数据，为变源研究提供了前所未有的数据集。

Abstract: The Gaia mission has observed over 2 billion stars repeatedly across the
entire sky over 10 years, revealing the many astronomical objects that vary on
human timescales from seconds to years. Its repeated astrometric, photometric,
spectrophotometric and spectroscopic measurements create an unprecedented
dataset to probe the variable celestial sources down to G ~ 21 mag. To extract
meaningful results from these many time series for so many sources, we have
used machine learning techniques for crossmatching, variability detection, and
variability classification. This approach has now led to the largest catalogue
of classified variable sources ever produced over the entire celestial sphere.

TL;DR: 应用Scaled Gradient Projection算法对ZTF观测图像进行单波段去卷积，在恒星源上表现良好，能保持光度精度、减小通量不确定性、揭示新暗源，并实现潜在的去混叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面天文观测受大气视宁度限制，去卷积可以逆转这种效应，从多方面提升科学数据质量。

Method: 使用Scaled Gradient Projection算法对ZTF观测图像进行单波段去卷积处理。

Result: 去卷积后源具有约1像素的FWHM，检测完整度≥99.6%，能揭示先前无法检测的暗源，识别出超出SExtractor去混叠能力的潜在分离源。

Conclusion: 该方法比Richardson-Lucy去卷积更好且快8倍，可作为可靠的巡天数据处理方法。

Abstract: Ground-based astronomical observations will continue to produce
resolution-limited images due to atmospheric seeing. Deconvolution reverses
such effects and thus can benefit extracted science in multifaceted ways. We
apply the Scaled Gradient Projection (SGP) algorithm for the single-band
deconvolution of several observed images from the Zwicky Transient Facility and
mainly discuss the performance on stellar sources. The method shows good
photometric flux preservation, which deteriorates for fainter sources but
significantly reduces flux uncertainties even for the faintest sources.
Deconvolved sources have a well-defined Full-Width-at-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of
roughly one pixel (one arcsecond for ZTF) regardless of the observed seeing.
Detection after deconvolution results in catalogs with $\gtrsim$99.6%
completeness relative to detections in the observed images. A few observed
sources that could not be detected in the deconvolved image are found near
saturated sources, whereas for others, the deconvolved counterparts are
detected when slightly different detection parameters are used. The
deconvolution reveals new faint sources previously undetectable, which are
confirmed by crossmatching with the deeper DESI Legacy DR10 and with
Pan-STARRS1 through forced photometry. The method could identify examples of
serendipitous potential deblends that exceeded SExtractor's deblending
capabilities, with as extreme as $\Delta m \approx 3$ and separations as small
as one arcsecond between the deblended components. Our survey-agnostic approach
is better and eight times faster than Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and could
be a reliable method for incorporation into survey pipelines.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: BOOM是一个实时联合代理天文警报流的分析框架，专为处理大规模天文数据流设计，性能比现有系统提升约8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高吞吐量巡天望远镜和多种多信使、多波长仪器的出现，急需能够处理相关数据流的软件来满足这些需求。

Method: 构建基于Rust的软件栈，使用非关系型MongoDB数据库、Valkey内存处理队列和Kafka消息集群，实现实时处理工作流。

Result: 系统性能达到现有ZTF系统的约8倍吞吐量，实现了功能对等并展示了自定义过滤器的能力。

Conclusion: 为Rubin时代做准备，制定了BOOM及其公共LSST警报代理Babamul的发展路线图。

Abstract: With the arrival of ever higher throughput wide-field surveys and a multitude
of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength instruments to complement them,
software capable of harnessing these associated data streams is urgently
required. To meet these needs, a number of community supported alert brokers
have been built, currently focused on processing of Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF; $\sim 10^5$-$10^6$ alerts per night) with an eye towards Vera C. Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST; $\sim 2 \times 10^7$
alerts per night). Building upon the system that successfully ran in production
for ZTF's first seven years of operation, we introduce BOOM (Burst & Outburst
Observations Monitor), an analysis framework focused on real-time, joint
brokering of these alert streams. BOOM harnesses the performance of a
Rust-based software stack relying on a non-relational MongoDB database combined
with a Valkey in-memory processing queue and a Kafka cluster for message
sharing. With this system, we demonstrate feature parity with the existing ZTF
system with a throughput $\sim 8 \times$ higher. We describe the workflow that
enables the real-time processing as well as the results with custom filters we
have built to demonstrate the system's capabilities. In conclusion, we present
the development roadmap for both BOOM and Babamul - the public-facing LSST
alert broker built atop BOOM - as we begin the Rubin era.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: StarDICE实验提出使用红外热相机辐射测量数据校正光度数据的新方法，通过热辐射过剩和校准星合成与仪器通量差异来拟合灰消光校正模型，显著提高了光度测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了建立实验室标准与天体物理通量之间的计量链，达到1 mmag的精度目标，需要解决可变大气效应（特别是云的灰消光）这一主要挑战。

Method: 使用红外热相机同时进行辐射测量，基于热辐射过剩和校准星合成与仪器通量差异，逐图像拟合灰消光校正模型，结合现场环境监测、辐射传输模拟和Gaia DR3星表数据。

Result: 校正后残差显著减小，生成分辨率为2角分的消光校正图，精度约0.01星等。最严重灰消光曝光的平均绝对误差从0.64降至0.11星等，非理想光度序列的时间变化可降至每源0.025星等。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效校正灰消光，显著提高光度测量精度，为StarDICE实验的应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The StarDICE experiment seeks to establish a metrology chain linking
laboratory standards to astrophysical fluxes, targeting 1 mmag accuracy in the
$\textit{griz}$ bands. Reaching this precision requires mitigating variable
atmospheric effects, especially gray extinction from clouds, which remains a
major challenge. To address this challenge, we present a novel method for
correcting photometric data using simultaneous radiometric measurements from an
infrared thermal camera. The gray extinction correction model is fitted on an
image-by-image basis as a function of thermal radiance excess and difference
between synthetic and instrumental fluxes of calibration stars. This approach
stands out by avoiding any assumptions about spatial structure and leveraging a
forward model combining in situ environmental monitoring, radiative transfer
simulations and use of Gaia Data Release 3 star catalogs. We demonstrate the
method using data collected from a dedicated experimental remote observation
system, built to conduct repeated observations of two fields over several
nights in varying atmosphere conditions. We show that applying the correction
model to each source in the test sample results in a reduction of residuals
between corrected and reference magnitudes. It delivers extinction correction
maps for individual images with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an accuracy of
$\sim$0.01 mag. This leads to a significant improvement in accuracy per image,
with the mean absolute error decreasing from 0.64 to 0.11 mag for the most gray
extinguished exposures. The temporal variations in extinction for non-ideal
photometric sequences can be reduced to 0.025 mag per source, which is
promising for its application in StarDICE.

### [5] [ATCAT: Astronomical Timeseries CAusal Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00614)
*Zora Tung*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 使用小型Transformer模型和优化的光变曲线编码逻辑，在ELAsTiCC挑战中实现了新的最先进分类性能：仅使用光变曲线数据达到71.8% F1分数，结合元数据达到89.8% F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为应对LSST望远镜将产生的海量时域天文数据分类挑战，需要开发可扩展、准确且高效的分类方法。

Method: 采用小型Transformer模型和优化的光变曲线编码逻辑，结合正则化、引导集成和无监督预训练等技术实现标签高效训练。

Result: 在ELAsTiCC数据集上显著超越先前最佳结果，GPU优化实现速度比其他最先进模型快9倍，推理速度可达33000条光变曲线/秒。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了最先进的分类性能，还具备标签高效、计算效率高和良好校准的特性，适合大规模天文数据分类应用。

Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory
will capture light curves (LCs) for 10 billion sources and produce millions of
transient candidates per night, necessitating scalable, accurate, and efficient
classification. To prepare the community for this scale of data, the Extended
LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC) sought to
simulate a diversity of LSST-like time-domain events. Using a small
transformer-based model and refined light curve encoding logic, we present a
new state of the art classification performance on ELAsTiCC, with 71.8% F1 on
LC-only classifications, and 89.8% F1 on LC+metadata classifications. Previous
state of the art was 65.5% F1 for LC-only, and for LC+metadata, 84% F1 with a
different setup and 83.5% F1 with a directly comparable setup. Our model
outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for fine-grained early detection
at all time cutoffs, which should help prioritize candidate transients for
follow-up observations. We demonstrate label-efficient training by removing
labels from 90% of the training data (chosen uniformly at random), and
compensate by leveraging regularization, bootstrap ensembling, and unsupervised
pretraining. Even with only 10% of the labeled data, we achieve 67.4% F1 on
LC-only and 87.1% F1 on LC+metadata, validating an approach that should help
mitigate synthetic and observational data drift, and improve classification on
tasks with less labeled data. We find that our base model is poorly calibrated
via reliability diagrams, and correct it at a minimal cost to overall
performance, enabling selections by classification precision. Finally, our
GPU-optimized implementation is 9x faster than other state-of-the-art ELAsTiCC
models, and can run inference at ~33000 LCs/s on a consumer-grade GPU, making
it suitable for large-scale applications, and less expensive to train.

### [6] [Modeling dust dynamics in OpenGadget3 - I. SPH implementation of the One-Fluid model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00631)
*Giovanni Tedeschi-Prades,Til Birnstiel,Klaus Dolag,Barbara Ercolano,Mark Hutchison*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 在OpenGadget3中实现了改进的单流体模型，用于模拟气体-尘埃混合物动力学，引入了时间相关的人工粘性和传导性，以及新的尘埃扩散处理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尘埃动力学在天体物理过程中至关重要，需要开发更有效的数值模拟方法来准确模拟气体-尘埃混合物的行为。

Method: 在OpenGadget3中实现单流体模型，添加时间相关的人工粘性和传导性，以及使用压力类项处理尘埃扩散的新方法。

Result: 改进模型成功通过了所有标准基准测试（DUSTYBOX、DUSTYWAVE、DUSTYSHOCK等），在简单和复杂模拟中均表现出稳定性和准确性。

Conclusion: 增强的单流体模型是OpenGadget3中模拟尘埃动力学的可靠工具，虽然保留了原始公式的一些限制，但改进扩展了其适用性并解决了气体-尘埃动力学中的一些挑战。

Abstract: Dust dynamics plays a critical role in astrophysical processes and has been
modeled in hydrodynamical simulations using various approaches. Among
particle-based methods like Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), the
One-Fluid model has proven to be highly effective for simulating gas-dust
mixtures. This study presents the implementation of the One-Fluid model in
OpenGadget3, introducing improvements to the original formulation. These
enhancements include time-dependent artificial viscosity and conductivity, as
well as a novel treatment of dust diffusion using a pressure-like term. The
improved model is tested using a suite of dust dynamics benchmark problems:
DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK, with the latter extended to
multidimensional scenarios, as well as a dusty Sedov-Taylor blast wave.
Additional tests include simulations of Cold Keplerian Disks, dusty
protoplanetary disks, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to evaluate the
model's robustness in more complex flows. The implementation successfully
passes all standard benchmark tests. It demonstrates stability and accuracy in
both simple and complex simulations. The new diffusion term improves the
handling of flows with large dust-to-gas ratios and low drag coefficients,
although limitations of the One-Fluid model in these regimes remain. The
enhanced One-Fluid model is a reliable and robust tool for simulating dust
dynamics in OpenGadget3. While it retains some limitations inherent to the
original formulation, the introduced improvements expand its applicability and
address some challenges in gas-dust dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出基于特征的方法框架，通过跟踪信息论、标度律和几何学的滑动窗口不变量，从一分钟中子监测数据中预测福布什下降事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发实用的早期预警工具，补充幅度阈值方法，实现空间天气业务中的临近预报工作流程。

Method: 为每个站点和事件计算多种标记序列（香农熵、谱熵、排列熵、样本熵、近似熵、Lempel-Ziv复杂度、Hurst指数、关联维数、多种分形维数），使用指数加权移动平均平滑，分析相对于平滑计数导数最小时间的标准化导数。

Result: 紧凑稳健的面板-Hurst指数、Katz分形维数、香农熵、样本熵和Lempel-Ziv复杂度始终领先于计数导数，提供从几十到数百分钟的可操作提前时间。某些描述符具有事件依赖性。

Conclusion: 基于导数对齐的不变量面板可作为实用的早期预警工具，在空间天气业务中实现临近预报工作流程。

Abstract: We present a feature-based framework to anticipate Forbush decreases (FDs)
from one-minute neutron-monitor data by tracking sliding-window invariants from
information theory, scaling, and geometry. For each station and event, we
compute marker series (Shannon, spectral, permutation, sample and approximate
entropy; Lempel-Ziv complexity; Hurst via DFA; correlation dimension; Higuchi,
Katz, and Petrosian fractal dimensions), smooth them with an exponentially
weighted moving average, and analyze within-station standardized derivatives
relative to the time of the minimum of the smoothed count derivative. Leads are
reported in minutes (negative = precedes) and station-level significance is
defined on a pre-onset window via a robust z-score detector with bilateral
threshold and persistence; no cross-correlation or hypothesis testing is
required. Applied to three recent FDs (2023-04-23, 2024-03-24, 2024-05-10), a
compact, robust panel-Hurst (DFA), Katz fractal dimension, Shannon and sample
entropy, and Lempel-Ziv-consistently precedes the count derivative with
substantial station coverage, yielding actionable lead times from tens to
several hundred minutes depending on morphology. Some descriptors are
event-dependent: permutation and spectral entropy are strongly anticipatory in
the extreme May 2024 episode but closer to contemporaneous in the rapid March
2024 case. Heatmaps, violin plots, and station overlays corroborate these
patterns. The approach is reproducible from open code, operates on native
station units without cross-station homogenization, and is qualitatively stable
to window, smoothing, and detector settings. These results support
derivative-aligned invariant panels as practical early-warning tools that
complement amplitude thresholds and enable nowcasting workflows in
space-weather operations.

*Yan Yu,Bin Ma,Tianmeng Zhang,Yi Hu,Yajie Zhang*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 针对中国空间站巡天望远镜的宇宙线污染问题，提出了一种基于深度学习的单图像处理方法，包括改进的DeepCR检测模型和形态敏感的修复方法，在检测精度和科学目标修复方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSST望远镜面临严重的宇宙线污染问题，由于巡天策略限制无法使用传统的多帧叠加方法，需要开发有效的单图像处理方案。

Method: 重新训练DeepCR模型用于宇宙线检测，并提出创新的形态敏感修复方法：对恒星/星系区域使用UNet++模型，背景区域使用自适应中值滤波。

Result: 宇宙线检测达到97.90±0.18%召回率和98.67±0.05%精确率；修复方法对不同强度和位置的宇宙线均有效，光度误差可控制在未污染源的水平，相比掩模方法检测率提高13.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为下一代空间望远镜提供了强大的宇宙线缓解方案，能够有效处理单图像中的宇宙线污染问题。

Abstract: As a space telescope, the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will
face significant challenges from cosmic ray (CR) contamination. These CRs will
severely degrade image quality and further influence scientific analysis. Due
to the CSST's sky survey strategy, traditional multi-frame stacking methods
become invalid. The limited revisits prompted us to develop an effective
single-image CR processing method for CSST. We retrained the DeepCR model based
on CSST simulated images and achieved 97.90+-0.18% recall and 98.67+-0.05%
precision on CR detection. Moreover, this paper puts forward an innovative
morphology-sensitive inpainting method, which focuses more on areas with higher
scientific value. We trained a UNet++ model especially on contaminated
stellar/galactic areas, alongside adaptive median filtering for background
regions. This method achieves effective for CRs with different intensities and
different distances from centers of scientific targets. By this approach, the
photometric errors of CR-corrected targets could be restricted to the level
comparable to those of uncontaminated sources. Also, it increases the detection
rate by 13.6% compared to CR masking. This method will provide a robust CR
mitigation for next-generation space telescopes.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 使用凯克望远镜作为测试平台，开发验证HWO的波前传感和控制策略，特别是针对分段主镜的相位控制，为未来直接成像类地行星做准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接成像类地行星需要达到10^{-10}对比度水平，这要求维持皮米级的波前稳定性，特别是在分段主镜存在的情况下。凯克望远镜具备验证HWO分段相位策略所需的所有硬件组件。

Method: 利用凯克望远镜现有的基础设施，包括分段主镜、电容边缘传感器、变形镜、Zernike波前传感器和高对比度科学仪器，开发闭环控制策略，在科学观测的同时校正主镜分段活塞误差。

Result: 通过使用ZWFS在闭环中感知和校正主镜分段活塞，成功提高了NIRC2科学相机上的Strehl比。

Conclusion: 这项工作将为HWO的误差预算方法和多时间尺度嵌套控制循环策略提供实际观测验证，为未来直接成像类地行星奠定技术基础。

Abstract: Exoplanet direct imaging allows us to directly probe and characterize an
exoplanet's atmosphere, searching for signs of life in its atmospheric
signatures. Directly imaging an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star
requires reaching 10$^{-10}$ contrast levels and will be the goal of the
Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). A key technical barrier to reaching such
deep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of
picometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck
Observatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary
for validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary
mirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor
(ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these
parallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO
wavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the
full system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing
infrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS
installed on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror
segment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This
resulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al.
2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority,
actuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing
infrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability.
Moreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will
validate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and
in particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales.

Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime
which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the
transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and
construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation
equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG)
Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP ,
which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We intend to extend
our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content with a view to also obtaining
conserved quantities in this context.

Motivation: 研究黑洞在散射过程中通过吸收引力波辐射的轨道角动量和能量而获得自旋增加和质量增益的物理机制。

Method: 进行一系列数值相对论模拟，考虑等质量黑洞的广泛初始自旋范围（χi∈[-0.7,0.7]）、不同初始动量、入射角度，识别散射与合并的阈值。

Result: 自旋增加和质量增益在接近阈值角度、大动量和负初始自旋的系统中最大；在阈值角度处，自旋增加随初始自旋线性减小；初始自旋χi=0.7的系统有时会出现自旋下降。

Conclusion: 黑洞散射过程中的自旋增加和质量增益受初始条件显著影响，最大自旋增加为0.3，最大质量增益为15%。

Abstract: Scattering black holes spin up and gain mass through the re-absorption of
orbital angular momentum and energy radiated in gravitational waves during
their encounter. In this work, we perform a series of numerical relativity
simulations to investigate the spin-up and mass-gain for equal-mass black holes
with a wide range of equal initial spins, $\chi_{\rm i}\in[-0.7,0.7]$, aligned
(or anti-aligned) to the orbital angular momentum. We also consider a variety
of initial momenta. Furthermore, we explore a range of incident angles and
identify the threshold between scattering and merging configurations. The
spin-up and mass-gain are typically largest in systems with incident angles
close to the threshold value, large momenta, and negative (i.e. anti-aligned)
initial spins. When evaluated at the threshold angle, we find that the spin-up
decreases linearly with initial spin. Intriguingly, systems with initial spin
$\chi_{\rm i}=0.7$ sometimes experience a spin-down, in spite of an increase in
the black-hole angular momentum, due to a corresponding gain in the black-hole
mass. Across the simulation suite, we find a maximum spin-up of $0.3$ and a
maximum increase in the black-hole mass of $15\%$.

Abstract: A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is
the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of
$f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and
isotropic universes. Within the limits of application of the new thermal
formalism, results on the convergence to Einstein cosmology (or lack thereof)
are first obtained for general $f(R)$ theories, and then illustrated with
power-law and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity.

Abstract: Formal analogies between gravitational and optical phenomena have been
explored for over a century, providing valuable insights into kinematic aspects
of general relativity. Here, this analogy is employed to study light
propagation in linear magnetoelectric media from an effective spacetime
perspective. Starting from Maxwell's equations in covariant form, it is shown
that an effective metric can always be identified for linear, non-dispersive
magnetoelectric materials. The effective metric is then used to construct
analog models in the limit of geometric optics. Among the optical effects
analyzed, it is shown that under reasonable assumptions on the magnitude of the
magnetoelectric response, a one-way propagation region can be established,
which behaves analogously to an event horizon.

TL;DR: 在f(R,T)修正引力框架下研究强磁场中子星结构性质，发现修正引力参数负值越大，中子星最大质量越高；强磁场（10^18高斯）仅轻微降低最大质量而不破坏球对称性。


<details>

Motivation: 研究强磁场中子星在f(R,T)修正引力理论中的结构特性，探索物质-几何耦合在高密度条件下对广义相对论的偏离效应。

Method: 数值求解修正的Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff方程，使用APR、FPS和SLy等各向同性状态方程，分析不同修正引力参数和中心磁场值下的质量-半径序列。

Result: 修正引力参数负值越大，中子星最大引力质量越高；强磁场（10^18高斯）仅轻微降低最大质量且不破坏球对称性；结果与GW170817、PSR和NICER观测数据一致。

Conclusion: f(R,T)修正引力理论能解释观测到的中子星质量，强磁场对中子星结构影响有限，修正引力参数在决定中子星最大质量方面起关键作用。

Abstract: The current work investigates the structural properties of neutron stars in
the presence of a strong magnetic field within the framework of f(R,T) modified
gravity, where the matter-geometry coupling leads to deviations from general
relativity at high matter densities. We present here the mass-radius sequences,
as well as the mass and pressure distributions for various values of the
modified gravity parameter and the central magnetic field. The modified
Tolman-Oppenheimer- Volkoff equations are numerically solved using isotropic
equations of state, specifically the APR, FPS, and SLy models. Comparing the
corresponding results in the context of general relativity suggests that more
negative values of the modified gravity parameter result in higher maximum
gravitational masses. In contrast, strong central magnetic fields of up to 1018
Gauss cause only a slight decrease in maximum mass without disrupting spherical
symmetry. Our findings are in agreement with the observed data from GW170817,
PSR and NICER.

Abstract: In this paper, we have presented the cosmological model of the Universe that
represents late time cosmic acceleration in torsion based gravitational theory,
the $f(T)$ gravity. A well motivated parametrization for the Hubble parameter
has been introduced and the free parameters involved are constrained using the
cosmological datasets. With the constrained values of the free parameters,
other geometrical parameters such as deceleration parameter, jerk parameter,
and snap parameter are analyzed and confronted with the prescribed value of the
cosmological observations. In addition, the dynamical parameters are analyzed
in some non-linear form of $f(T)$ and the energy conditions are also studied
and confirmed with the violation of the strong energy condition. The obtained
cosmological model provides late time phantom behavior of the Universe.

Motivation: 改进引力波色散关系测试方法，以更准确地检验广义相对论，特别是对修正色散关系的理论（如大质量引力子或洛伦兹对称性破缺）进行约束。

Method: 采用群速度参数化、改进的采样程序，并将测试扩展到负指数α（-1, -2, -3），重新分析GWTC-3目录中的引力波事件。

Result: 相比GWTC-3结果，单个事件的后验分布显著改善，组合振幅参数A_α的约束边界平均缩小19%。引力子质量的90%上限从2.42×10^-11 peV改进到2.21×10^-11 peV。对于负指数α的扩展测试，未发现支持广义相对论破缺的证据。

Conclusion: 改进的测试方法显著提高了对修正色散关系参数的约束精度，为检验广义相对论提供了更可靠的工具，目前数据仍支持广义相对论。

Abstract: Searching for a modified dispersion relation is one of the general relativity
tests performed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration with each new cumulative
Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC). It considers classes of theories
that modify the dispersion of gravitational waves by introducing a massive
graviton or breaking Lorentz invariance. The symmetry breaking is parameterized
phenomenologically by a momentum power law term $p^\alpha$ added to the
dispersion relation, with the test placing constraints on the amplitude
$A_\alpha$ of the introduced deviation. In this work, we implement improvements
to the test, chief among them group velocity parametrization, a better sampling
procedure, and extension to negative exponents $\alpha$ of $p$. We then
reanalyze the events from the third catalog, GWTC-3, with our improved method.
Compared with GWTC-3 results, we find significant improvement, mostly from the
improved sampling method, in the posteriors obtained by analyzing individual
event and more modest improvements in the combined bounds on amplitude
parameters $A_\alpha$ -- on average, we observe 19% shrinking of posterior
width. The 90% upper bound on the graviton mass changes from $2.42 \times
10^{-11}$ peV to $2.21 \times 10^{-11}$ peV. For the extension of our test to
$\alpha \in \{-1, -2, -3\}$, we find no evidence in favor of general relativity
violation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了超致密天体回波现象的两种解释：渐近高次准正则模式（回波模式）和准无反射散射模式。通过将准无反射模式扩展为完全无反射模式，并推广对称Damour-Solodukhin虫洞到非对称情况，研究发现这两种谱在复频率平面上具有显著的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究回波现象的物理本质，澄清回波模式与准无反射散射模式之间的关系，探索描述回波现象的有效理论框架。

Method: 采用解析处理方法，基于散射矩阵和格林函数两种互补方法，研究回波模式与反射无模式在复频率平面上的渐近性质。

Result: 发现回波模式与反射无模式的谱具有强相似性，在复频率平面上近似均匀分布且平行于实频率轴，具有相同的模式间距。在|Reω|≫|Imω|极限下，回波模式的实部与反射无模式重合。

Conclusion: 回波模式和反射无模式都提供了描述回波现象的有效工具，对称Damour-Solodukhin虫洞的反射无模式精确位于实频率轴上，任何偏离都反映了虫洞的不对称程度。

Abstract: It is understood that the echo waveforms in ultracompact objects can be
regarded as composed mainly of the asymptotic high-overtone quasinormal modes,
dubbed echo modes, which predominantly lie parallel to the real frequency axis.
Alternatively, Rosato {\it et al.} recently suggested that high-frequency
quasi-reflectionless scattering modes are primarily responsible for the echo
phenomenon. This identification relies on greybody factors as stable
observables, despite the apparent spectral instability of quasinormal modes. In
this work, by extending the definition of quasi-reflectionless modes to
reflectionless ones and generalizing symmetric Damour-Solodukhin wormholes to
asymmetric cases, we examine the underlying similarity between the
reflectionless and echo mode spectra in the complex frequency plane. Through a
primarily analytical treatment, we demonstrate that the asymptotic properties
of these two spectra exhibit a strong resemblance, featuring an approximately
uniform distribution parallel to the real frequency axis with the same spacing
between successive modes. Specifically, the real parts of echo modes coincide
with those of reflectionless modes at the limit $|\mathrm{Re}\omega| \gg
|\mathrm{Im}\omega|$. While echo modes typically possess non-vanishing
imaginary parts, the reflectionless modes of symmetric Damour-Solodukhin
wormholes lie precisely on the real frequency axis, with any deviation serving
as a measure of the degree of asymmetry of the wormhole. We support our
derivations by employing two complementary approaches, based on the scattering
matrix and the Green's function, and argue that both perspectives provide
effective tools for describing the echo phenomenon.

Result: 发现过去和未来的奇点在有限仿射参数或固有时间内都无法达到，时空在共形重标度下变为准FLRW时空，混沌行为得到抑制。

Conclusion: 共形变换能够消除Bianchi IX时空中的奇点，使时空在共形框架下变得测地线完备，并抑制混沌行为。

Abstract: We hereby address the cosmological singularity problem in a general
gravitational theory invariant under Weyl conformal transformations. In
particular, we focus on the Bianchi IX spacetime and we show that both the
initial (big bang) and final (big crunch) singularities disappear in an
infinite class of conformal frames naturally selected according to analyticity.
It turns out that the past and future singularities are both unattainable
within a finite affine parameter (for massless particles) or within a finite
proper time (for massive and conformally coupled particles). In order to prove
such a statement, we show the geodesic completion of the spacetime when probed
by massless, massive, and conformally coupled particles. Finally, the chaotic
behavior of the spacetime near the singularity is tamed by a conformal
rescaling that turns the Bianchi IX metric into a quasi-FLRW spacetime.

Abstract: In this work, we consider a spherically symmetric static black hole metric in
Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, and investigate the impact of relevant parameters on
the black hole shadow and polarization images. For black hole shadow images, we
consider two geometrically thick accretion disk models such as a
phenomenological RIAF-like model and an analytical HOU disk model. In each
case, we observe a bright ring-like structure corresponding to the higher-order
images with a surrounding region of non-zero intensity that represents the
primary image. The increasing values of $\hat{\lambda}$ or $\hat{\gamma}$
results in decrease the size of the higher-order image, while increasing values
of observer inclination $\theta_{o}$ alter its shape and cause the horizons
outline to be obscured. On the other hand, in HOU disk model, at high observer
inclinations, the obscuration of the horizons outline by radiation from outside
the equatorial plane is weakened. Consequently, the brightness of the primary
image in the phenomenological model is significantly greater than that in the
HOU disk model, indicating the strong gravitational lensing effect. For the
polarized images, we use only the HOU disk model with anisotropic radiation,
assuming an infalling accretion flow matter. The obtained results illustrate
that the polarization intensity $P_{o}$ in the higher-order image region is
significantly stronger than as compare to other regions, and it is rapidly
decreases away from this region. The variation in $\hat{\lambda}$ and
$\hat{\gamma}$ depicts the intrinsic structure of the space-time and $\theta_o$
depends on the observers orientation, together they shape the polarization
features.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统波形建模假设双星系统孤立存在，但实际可能存在第三个天体。研究目的是理解遥远第三体如何影响双星动力学，特别是潮汐相互作用。

Method: 采用微扰方法处理三体问题，修改了轨道运动方程和双星组分四极矩演化方程，分析了潮汐相互作用对辐射能量和相位积累的影响。

Result: 研究发现对于b-EMRI系统，潮汐效应较弱；而对于b-IMRI系统，这些效应最为显著，值得深入研究。

Conclusion: 第三体的存在会对双星动力学产生可观测的影响，特别是在b-IMRI系统中，潮汐相互作用效应显著，需要在波形建模中予以考虑。

Abstract: For waveform modelling of compact binary coalescence, it is conventionally
assumed that the binary is in isolation. In this work, we break that assumption
and introduce a third body at a distance. The primary goal is to understand how
the distant third body would affect the binary dynamics. However, in the
present work, we treat the three-body problem perturbatively and study tidal
interaction in the binary due to the third body's presence. We introduce
appropriate modifications to the equations governing the orbital motions and
the evolution equations of the binary component's quadrupole moment. Further,
we obtain the radiated energy and accumulated dephasing for the binary. We show
that for b-EMRI, the effect is weak in the tidal sector, while for systems such
as b-IMRIs, it would be most relevant to study these effects.

Motivation: 探索Hayward黑洞（既可视为规则时空，又可视为渐近安全引力有效几何）中大质量标量场的动力学行为，特别是准正规模和灰体因子的特性。

Method: 使用带Padé改进的WKB方法计算准正规谱和灰体因子，并通过时域积分和Prony分析进行验证。

Result: 场质量显著抑制准正规振荡的衰减率，产生长寿命模式；时域中标准指数衰减被具有幂律包络的振荡尾部取代；灰体因子显示传输峰向高频移动且低频部分被抑制。

Conclusion: 准正规模与灰体因子的对应关系对大质量场仍然有效，对于大多极数高度准确，但随着场质量增加或多极数减少而逐渐失去精度。

Abstract: We study the dynamics of a massive scalar field in the background of the
Hayward black hole, which can be interpreted both as a regular spacetime and as
an effective geometry arising from Asymptotically Safe gravity. The quasinormal
spectrum and grey-body factors are computed using the WKB method with Pad\'e
improvements and confirmed through time-domain integration followed by Prony
analysis. We find that the mass of the field significantly suppresses the
damping rate of quasinormal oscillations, giving rise to long-lived modes that
continuously approach arbitrarily long-lived states (quasi-resonances) at
certain critical field masses. In the time domain, the standard exponentially
decaying ringdown is replaced by oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope.
The corresponding grey-body factors reveal a pronounced shift of the
transmission peak toward higher frequencies and a suppression of the
low-frequency part of the spectrum. Finally, we show that the correspondence
between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors remains valid for massive
fields, being highly accurate for large multipole numbers and gradually losing
precision as either the field mass increases or the multipole number decreases.

Method: 通过分离Klein-Gordon方程的变量，将径向部分简化为一般Heun方程，使用Heun函数计算准正规模式，并分析能量和角动量通量变化。

Result: KR参数显著修改准正规模式谱，左分支基模存在不稳定性；KR场改变了超辐射的阈值和Robin耦合参数范围。

Conclusion: KR场在黑洞扰动建模中具有重要作用，能显著影响准正规模式和超辐射特性。

Abstract: We investigate the scalar perturbation of a newly proposed Kalb-Ramond (KR)
BTZ-like black hole. After the separation of variables for the Klein-Gordon
equation, we find that the radial part reduces to the general Heun equation.
Using the Heun function, we compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) subject to generic
Robin boundary conditions, which shows that the KR parameter substantially
modifies the QNM spectrum and only the fundamental mode on the left branch has
an instability. To ascertain whether the instability is superradiant, we
further analyze how the KR field changes the energy and angular momentum
fluxes. Our results show that the KR parameter shifts the threshold and the
range of the Robin coupling parameter where the superradiance occurs,
underscoring the importance of the KR field in modeling black hole
perturbations.

Conclusion: 能量条件的满足对爱因斯坦-以太理论的耦合参数施加了比先前理论和观测考虑更严格的限制。

Abstract: We perform the first study of traversable wormhole solutions in the
background of Einstein-Aether theory. We show that the field equations admit
some wormhole geometries, for several combinations of values of the aether
coupling constants. We investigating the null and weak energy conditions for
wormhole solutions with three types of the worm hole shape function. In
contrast to Einstein gravity, we find that by choosing adequate values for the
parameters of the models, wormhole geometries respect the energy conditions at
the wormhole throat and also throughout the whole space. Satisfaction of these
energy conditions led to some constraints on the value of the Einstein-Aether
theory. Comparing these constraints with those previously obtained from
theoretical and observational considerations, we find that the satisfaction of
energy condition put more limitations on the values of the Einstein-Aether
couplings.

TL;DR: DenoiseGapFiller (DGF) 是一个深度学习框架，专门用于重建被数据间隙和仪器噪声破坏的引力波环降信号，通过双分支编码器-解码器架构实现高质量信号重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引力波环降信号在观测中常因数据间隙和仪器噪声而损坏，这会影响信号检测和参数估计的准确性，因此需要开发能够有效重建这些损坏信号的方法。

Method: 采用双分支编码器-解码器架构，通过混合层和Transformer风格块进行融合，在包含高达20%数据间隙的合成环降波形上进行端到端训练。

Result: DGF实现了平均波形失配0.002，时域残差幅度降低约一个数量级，0.01-1 Hz频段的功率谱密度抑制1-2个数量级，恢复了0.01-0.1 Hz频段准正则模态的峰值。

Conclusion: 该模型能够忠实重建原始信号，为后续科学工作奠定了基础，在检测证据中产生更轻的惩罚，并为参数估计提供更紧密的可信区域。

Abstract: We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically
designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data
gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder
architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks.
Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the
segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual
amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the
power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of
magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency
representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully
reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the
detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a
foundation for the following scientific work.

Result: 发现第二代TDI与第一代具有相同灵敏度；A、E、T通道的灵敏度独立于TDI代数和具体组合；A和E通道响应相等，T通道低频响应较弱；大多数灵敏度曲线在特定频率范围内呈现平坦段。

Conclusion: 这些解析和近似公式为未来空间引力波探测器的仪器优化和数据分析研究提供了有用的基准。

Abstract: Forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will employ
second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress laser frequency
noise and achieve the sensitivity required for GW detection. We introduce an
inverse light-path operator $\mathcal{P}_{i_{1}i_{2}i_{3}\ldots i_{n-1}i_{n}}$,
which enables simple representation of second-generation TDI combinations and a
concise description of light propagation. Analytical expressions and
high-accuracy approximate formulas are derived for the sky- and
polarization-averaged response functions, noise power spectral densities
(PSDs), and sensitivity curves of TDI Michelson, ($\alpha,\beta,\gamma$),
Monitor, Beacon, Relay, and Sagnac combinations, as well as their orthogonal
$A, E, T$ channels. Our results show that: (i) second-generation TDIs have the
same sensitivities as their first-generation counterparts; (ii) the $A, E, T$
sensitivities and the optimal sensitivity are independent of the TDI generation
and specific combination; (iii) the $A$ and $E$ channels have equal averaged
responses, noise PSDs, and sensitivities, while the $T$ channel has much weaker
response and sensitivity at low frequencies ($2\pi fL/c\lesssim3$); (iv) except
for the $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $\zeta$ combinations and the $T$ channel,
all sensitivity curves exhibit a flat section in the range $f_{n}<f\lesssim
1.5/(2\pi L/c)$, where the noise-balance frequency $f_{n}$ separates the
proof-mass- and optical-path-dominated regimes, while the response-transition
frequency $\sim 1.5/(2\pi L/c)$ separates the response function's low- and
high-frequency behaviors; (v) the averaged response, noise PSD, and sensitivity
of $\zeta$ scales with those of the $T$ channel. These analytical and
approximate formulations provide useful benchmarks for instrument optimization
and data-analysis studies for future space-based GW detectors.

contains but also on how that matter resists gravity in different directions.
In this work, we investigate the final fate of highly magnetized
radiation-dominated spherically symmetric dissipative stellar configurations.
We study the dynamics of collapse by introducing a dimensionless geometric
factor $f(\theta, \phi)$ defined by the angular dependence of the radiative
opacity. Using the field equations, we derive direction-sensitive threshold
conditions that determine whether collapse initiates, halts, or reverses. The
resulting inequalities unify black hole formation, bounce behavior, and delayed
trapping of geodesics into a single geometrically controlled framework. This
theoretical analysis would help analyze the collapse through pre-computed
opacity tables for different magnetic field, temperature, and density profiles,
along with other data available for such considered profiles.

Motivation: 建立从运动方程到度量结构的直接路径，提供独立于传统变分框架的几何视角，为动力学系统研究提供基础。

Method: 通过施加合适的动力学约束将半喷射提升为喷射，然后通过重新参数化提取相关的度量结构。

Result: 应用于静态时空时恢复了光学度量、大质量粒子的雅可比度量及其在电磁场中带电粒子的推广；在平面圆形限制三体问题中自然产生了Randers型Finsler度量。

Conclusion: 该方法为动力学系统提供了独立的几何视角，可能成为进一步研究的基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a systematic approach to the geometrization of dynamics
from the viewpoint of the geodesic equation. The method promotes a semispray to
a spray through the imposition of suitable dynamical constraints, and the
associated metric structure is extracted via reparameterization. When applied
to static spacetimes, this spray-to-metric framework recovers the optical
metric, the Jacobi metric for massive particles, and its generalization for
charged particles in electromagnetic fields. We further show that a
Randers-type Finsler metric arises naturally in the planar circular restricted
three-body problem. By establishing a direct pathway from equations of motion
to metric structures, this work offers a geometric perspective, independent of
the traditional variational framework, may provide a basis for further studies
on dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了两种不同的非线性来源：非线性电动力学修正和非对易变形效应，为研究非对易几何与非线性电动力学的相互作用提供了新途径。

Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general
nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic
invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the
$\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are
encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting
equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this
framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its
nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a
general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed
solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion
perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate
the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several
prominent NLE theories.

Conclusion: 亚太阳质量致密双星合并的探测对宇宙学和核物理都具有重要意义，潮汐效应是区分原初黑洞与中子星的关键特征。

Abstract: The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as
one of the most compelling signatures of a population of primordial black holes
(PBHs). We critically examine whether such systems can be distinguished from
stellar binaries, such as those composed of neutron stars (NSs), which could
also populate the subsolar mass range. Unlike PBHs, the gravitational-wave
signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which increase by
several orders of magnitude as the mass decreases. We forecast the capability
of current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors to constrain tidal
effects in putative subsolar binaries. We also discuss the broader implications
that the detection of a subsolar merger would have for both cosmology and
nuclear physics.

Motivation: 重新审视黑洞吸积动力学，当周围介质密度不可忽略时，传统的史瓦西近似需要修正，以解决质量发散等非物理问题。

Method: 采用牛顿力学方法，对史瓦西近似进行启发式修正，考虑介质密度的影响。

Result: 修正后的模型消除了质量在有限时间内发散的问题，显著改变了黑洞的热力学性质，行为比传统模型更合理。

Conclusion: 虽然基于牛顿方法，但该修正模型为量子引力和反弹模型提供了有价值的启示，需要更严格的处理来验证结论。

Abstract: We revisit the dynamics of a black hole accreting energy from a surrounding
homogeneous and infinite space. We argue for a simple heuristic modification of
the Schwarzschild approximation when the density of the medium is not
negligible anymore. The resulting behavior is drastically modified: the mass
divergence at finite time is cured and the thermodynamical properties are
deeply changed. Some potential consequences for quantum gravity and bouncing
models are also pointed out. Those conclusions being mostly obtained from a
Newtonian approach, they only aim at guiding toward a more rigorous treatment.
Still, interestingly, the behavior is far more convincing that the one usually
obtained.

Method: 回顾Comisso-Asenjo磁重联过程，引入热点成像方法，分析热点强度的时间演化，考察能量提取发生与否、观测者方位角变化、黑洞膨胀参数和自旋的影响。

Result: 第一耀斑可能作为能量提取的潜在特征；观测者方位角变化会改变第一和第二耀斑的时间间隔；较大的膨胀参数和较高的自旋都会使能量提取信号更难识别。

Conclusion: 磁重联过程在Kerr-Sen黑洞中产生可观测的热点图像变化，第一耀斑可作为能量提取的标志，但黑洞参数会影响该信号的检测难度。

Abstract: In the Kerr-Sen black hole, this study investigates the changes in hotspot
images before and after the occurrence of magnetic reconnection. After
reviewing the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection process and introducing the
hotspot imaging method, we examine the temporal evolution of hotspot intensity,
including when energy extraction occurs, when it does not occur, and when the
observer's azimuthal angle is altered. We also discuss the influence of the
black hole's expansion parameter and spin on hotspot imaging. The results
indicate that the first flare may serve as a potential signature of ongoing
energy extraction: changing the observer's azimuthal angle may alter the time
interval between the first and second flares: a larger expansion parameter
makes it more difficult to identify the energy extraction signal, and a higher
spin also makes it more challenging to detect the energy extraction signal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This work explores the universal classification of thermodynamic topology for
charged static black holes within the $z=3$ Ho\u{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity theory,
considering both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We introduce a new
topological subclass, denoted as $\ddot{W}^{1-}$. This finding expands the
existing topological classification, going beyond the five previously defined
classes and their respective subclasses. The $\ddot{W}^{1-}$ subclass presents
a distinct and previously unobserved stability profile: In the low-temperature
regime, an unstable small black hole appears in the phase space, whereas, while
in the high temperature regime, two unstable small black holes exist together
with a stable large black hole. Our study underscores the dependence of charged
black hole stability on the selection of the ensemble. These results contribute
to refining and expanding the topological framework in black hole
thermodynamics, providing key perspectives on the underlying nature of black
holes and gravity.

Abstract: We investigate several geometrical and physical properties of the recently
found $W$-soliton solution (neutral case). We discuss both the genuine 5d
solution and its reduction to 4d and highlight similarities and differences. In
both cases, we study scattering processes of massless and massive particles in
the background, reconstructing the gauge-invariant scattering angle, either
with exact expressions or with large-angular momentum expansion expressions,
which we show how to resum in a useful form. Finally, we analyze the
propagation of a test scalar field in the $W$-soliton background and compute
the spectrum of Quasi Normal Modes in the case of (non-)minimal coupling and
the radiated energy in the case of minimal coupling. Our result for the energy
loss is fully analytic and presented in a Post-Newtonian expansion, following
the approach termed gravitational self force.

TL;DR: 本文通过拓扑方法研究静态球对称时空中自旋测试粒子的类时圆轨道，发现在相邻视界之间拓扑数为W=-1（存在不稳定轨道），在最外层视界外W=0（轨道成对出现或不存在），这些结论与粒子自旋方向无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自旋测试粒子在静态球对称时空中的运动，探索轨道拓扑性质与时空结构的基本关系，即使考虑自旋效应时仍能揭示不变的拓扑特性。

Method: 基于Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon形式体系和Tulczyjew自旋补充条件，构建辅助势场和关联向量场，计算类时圆轨道的拓扑绕数W。

Result: 在相邻视界间W=-1（至少存在一个不稳定轨道），最外层视界外W=0（轨道成对出现或不存在），这些结果在Schwarzschild、Schwarzschild-AdS和Schwarzschild-dS时空中得到验证。

Conclusion: 拓扑方法揭示了即使包含自旋效应时仍保持不变的轨道性质，突出了时空结构本身对粒子轨道拓扑的根本影响。

Abstract: Based on a detailed study of the motion of spinning test particles within the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon formalism under the Tulczyjew spin-supplementary
condition in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, we investigate the
topological properties of timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for such particles.
By constructing an auxiliary potential and an associated vector field on the
equatorial plane, we compute the topological winding number W for regions
between horizons and outside the outermost horizon in asymptotically flat,
anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) black hole spacetimes. Our results
show that between two neighboring horizons (including the cosmological horizon
in the dS case), the topological number is W=-1, indicating the presence of at
least one unstable TCO. Outside the outermost horizon, we find W=0 for both
asymptotically flat and AdS black holes, implying that any TCOs must appear in
stable-unstable pairs or be absent. These conclusions are independent of the
spin orientation (co-rotating or counter-rotating) of the test particle. The
analysis is supported by explicit examples in Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-AdS,
and Schwarzschild-dS spacetimes, confirming the general topological
predictions. While the effective potential for spinning particles has been
previously studied, the topological approach employed here reveals invariant
properties that remain robust even when spin is included, thereby highlighting
the fundamental influence of the spacetime structure itself.

Method: 分析Brans-Dicke-Kerr时空的图像特征，研究不同ω参数值下的阴影形态和结构变化。

Result: 发现当a≤M时阴影持续存在且随ω减小而变平变小；ω<1/2时出现特殊的水母状分形结构；a>M时图像中出现由两个分离斑块组成的灰色区域。

Conclusion: Brans-Dicke-Kerr时空可通过其图像特征与Kerr和Kerr-de Sitter情况区分，这些效应有助于揭示时空内在结构并为测试Brans-Dicke理论提供观测依据。

Abstract: We have studied the images of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with a
dimensionless Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$, which belongs to axisymmetric
rotating solutions in the Brans-Dicke theory. Our results show that the
Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime with the parameter $\omega>-3/2$ represents naked
singularities with distinct structures. For the case with $a \leq M$, the
shadow in the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime persists, gradually becomes flatter
and smaller as $\omega$ decreases. Especially when $\omega<1/2$, the shadow in
the image exhibit a very special ``jellyfish" shape and possesses a
self-similar fractal structure. For the case with $a > M$, a distinct gray
region consisting of two separate patches appears in the image observed by
equatorial observers. This indicating that the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetime can
be distinguished from the Kerr and Kerr-de Sitter cases based on its image.
These effects of the Brans-Dicke parameter could help us to reveal the
intrinsic structure of the Brans-Dicke-Kerr spacetimes and provide a foundation
for testing Brans-Dicke theory through future high-precision observations.

Conclusion: 利用事件视界望远镜的观测数据成功约束了四维爱因斯坦-高斯-博内特引力理论中的高斯-博内特耦合常数。

Abstract: In order to better describe gravitational phenomena on both very small and
cosmological scales, there have been constant attempts to generalize and expand
the theory of General Relativity (GR) since its inception. The Einstein Gauss
Bonnet (EGB) theory is one such extension that adds spacetime corrections
related to curvature. Since the standard Gauss Bonnet term is purely
topological, it does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions.
To get around this restriction, however, an invariant four dimensional limit
has been developed. In this work, we study Extreme Compact Charged Objects
(ECCOs), which can resemble black holes, in a gravity framework that is
compatible with Einstein Gauss Bonnet in four dimensions. Our main goal is to
compare theoretical predictions with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
observational data in order to constrain the Gauss Bonnet coupling constant
{\alpha}. In order to achieve this, we investigate important optical
characteristics like the shadow, light bending angle, and other associated
observables, as well as the geodesic structure of ECCO spacetimes in EGB
gravity. Finally, we apply these findings to constrain the Gauss Bonnet
constant.

Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and
spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear
electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual
formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a
real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to
the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free
branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are
entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints,
finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental
scalar quasi-normal modes ($< 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios),
indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do
not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to
explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes,
extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.

Abstract: We systematically investigate the directional dependence of Gaussian
quadripartite quantum steering and its redistribution among different modes in
the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. For physically accessible
sectors, we identify three distinct behaviors: (i) steering from
non-gravitational to gravitational observers undergoes sudden death at maximal
asymmetry with the Hawking temperature, marking the crossover from two-way to
one-way steerability; (ii) steering in the opposite direction decays
monotonically and vanishes only in the extreme black hole limit, highlighting
its directional sensitivity to spacetime curvature; (iii) steering from hybrid
gravitational-non-gravitational partitions to non-gravitational mode persists
at a finite asymptotic value set by the initial squeezing parameter. Moreover,
all inaccessible steerings generated by the Hawking effect exhibit an intrinsic
asymmetry, with their specific behavior being strongly dependent on the
steering direction.

Abstract: The idea of extra spatial dimensions arises from attempts to unify gravity
with other fundamental interactions, develop a consistent theory of quantum
gravity, and address open problems in particle physics and cosmology.
Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding how such dimensions
modify gravitational theories. One way to probe their impact is through the
analytical study of astrophysical processes such as black hole accretion. Since
accretion efficiently converts gravitational energy into radiation, this makes
it a powerful tool to test modified gravity (MOG) theories and
higher-dimensional frameworks via the behavior of dark compact objects like
black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the
dynamics of neutral particles around a higher-dimensional, regular, spherically
symmetric MOG compact object, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO), energy flux, temperature, and differential luminosity. We further
analyze the accretion of a perfect fluid onto the same object, deriving
analytical expressions for the four-velocity and proper energy density of the
inflowing matter. Our findings show that extra dimensions reduce the ISCO
radius while enhancing the corresponding flux and temperature. Finally, by
comparing the effective disk temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$ with Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, we argue that MOG and
higher-dimensional corrections to the accretion disk properties could be close
to the current threshold of detectability.

Motivation: 研究带有挠率的修正引力理论的半经典处理，特别是在爱因斯坦-嘉当理论框架下，探索非最小耦合标量场的量子效应。

Method: 使用Hadamard重整化方法，构建重整化拉格朗日量（用微分形式表示），处理能量-动量和自旋密度算符的期望值中的尺度和重整化模糊性。

Result: 获得了能量-动量和自旋密度算符的明确定义的期望值，识别了重整化模糊性，并分析了在挠率存在下仍然存在的共形异常。

Conclusion: 成功建立了爱因斯坦-嘉当理论中非最小耦合克莱因-戈登场的半经典处理框架，解决了重整化问题并确认了共形异常的持续性。

Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory of modified gravity with nontrivial
spacetime torsion. In particular, we show that the semiclassical treatment can
be axiomatized in the case of Einstein--Cartan theory with a nonminimally
coupled, free Klein--Gordon field, in four dimensions. Using Hadamard
renormalization, we obtain well-defined expectation values for both, the
energy--momentum and spin--density operators. These objects exhibit scale and
renormalization ambiguities; we identify the latter by constructing a
renormalization Lagrangian in terms of differential forms, which are
particularly well suited for this purpose. Furthermore, we analyze the
conformal anomaly, which persists in the presence of torsion.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于广义质量-视界熵的宇宙学框架中重子不对称性的产生。这种熵是Bekenstein-Hawking面积律的幂律扩展，通过修正Friedmann方程影响哈勃参数演化，使得标准超引力耦合能产生非零的物质-反物质不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在修正的引力-热力学框架下，如何通过广义质量-视界熵来解释宇宙中观测到的重子不对称性，并检验标准Bekenstein-Hawking熵的微小偏离是否必要。

Method: 应用引力-热力学猜想，基于广义质量-视界熵推导修正的Friedmann方程，研究其对哈勃参数演化的影响，并分析标准超引力耦合在修正框架下产生重子不对称性的机制。

Result: 与观测数据比较得到对熵指数的严格约束：0 < 1 - n ≲ O(10⁻²)，在解耦温度T_D ≈ 10¹⁶ GeV时，这与当前暴胀尺度张量模式波动的上限一致。

Conclusion: 微小的、物理上显著的偏离标准Bekenstein-Hawking熵(n=1)可能是实现与当前宇宙学观测完全一致性所必需的。

Abstract: We investigate the generation of the baryon asymmetry within the cosmological
framework based on a generalized mass-to-horizon entropy. This entropy,
recently proposed as a power-law extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law,
arises from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency
with the Clausius relation. By applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture,
the resulting corrections to the Friedmann equations modify the evolution of
the Hubble parameter. Consequently, even the standard supergravity coupling
between the Ricci scalar and the baryon current can generate a non-vanishing
matter-antimatter asymmetry. Comparison with observational data yields a
stringent constraint on the entropic exponent, namely $0 < 1 - n \lesssim
\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, at the decoupling temperature $T_D \simeq
10^{16}\,\text{GeV}$, corresponding to the current upper limit on tensor-mode
fluctuations at the inflationary scale. These findings indicate that minor,
subtle, yet physically significant departures, from the standard
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy ($n = 1$) may be required to achieve full
consistency with present cosmological observations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的正能量定理建立在渐近平坦流形上，但实际天体物理系统存在于膨胀宇宙中，其第二基本形式是脐点的。因此需要为具有脐点第二基本形式的初始数据集建立能量概念。

Method: 采用de Sitter空间作为背景时空，利用其平坦膨胀坐标下由脐点超曲面叶化的特性，通过将Liu-Yau能量适应到该框架中来定义准局域能量。

Result: 成功定义了在宇宙膨胀背景下的准局域能量，并证明了当宇宙学常数有界时该能量具有正定性。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了正能量定理的应用范围，为宇宙学背景下的引力系统提供了合适的能量定义和正定性结果。

Abstract: The positive energy theorems are a fundamental pillar in mathematical general
relativity. Originally proved by Schoen-Yau and later Witten, these theorems
were established for asymptotically flat manifolds where the metric tends to
the standard Euclidean metric and whose second fundamental form decays to zero
at infinity. This ansatz on the metric and second fundamental form is motivated
by the desire to model an isolated gravitational system with a Minkowski space
background for the spacetime. However, actual astrophysical massive objects are
not truly isolated but rather exist within an expanding cosmological universe,
where the second fundamental form is umbilic. With this in mind, we seek a
notion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form.
In this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding
cosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as
the background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is
foliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This
cosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the
presence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one.
We define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to
our framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded
values of the cosmological constant.

Motivation: 传统MIMO系统中最大似然解码器在数字硬件上具有指数级时间复杂度，近似解算器最多只有多项式时间复杂度，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用CMOS技术设计环形振荡器，使用FeFET作为耦合元件构建CMOS+X OIM设计，通过SPICE模拟验证FeFET在28nm HKMG CMOS技术节点中的电导调制特性。

Result: FeFET器件在1-60微西门子范围内具有高线性电导变化，适用于构建MIMO规模达100×100天线的OIM系统，且性能无明显下降。

Conclusion: 设计的模拟OIM如果实验实现，将提供与MIMO规模成对数关系的计算时间缩放，相比传统数字硬件解码器在计算速度上有巨大改进。

Abstract: Symbol decoding in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless
communication systems requires the deployment of fast, energy-efficient
computing hardware deployable at the edge. The brute-force, exact maximum
likelihood (ML) decoder, solved on conventional classical digital hardware, has
exponential time complexity. Approximate classical solvers implemented on the
same hardware have polynomial time complexity at the best. In this article, we
design an alternative ring-oscillator-based coupled oscillator array to act as
an oscillator Ising machine (OIM) and heuristically solve the ML-based MIMO
detection problem. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is
used to design the ring oscillators, and ferroelectric field effect transistor
(FeFET) technology is chosen as the coupling element (X) between the
oscillators in this CMOS + X OIM design. For this purpose, we experimentally
report high linear range of conductance variation (1 micro-S to 60 micro-S) in
a FeFET device fabricated at 28 nm high-K/ metal gate (HKMG) CMOS technology
node. We incorporate the conductance modulation characteristic in SPICE
simulation of the ring oscillators connected in an all-to-all fashion through a
crossbar array of these FeFET devices. We show that the above range of
conductance variation of the FeFET device is suitable to obtain optimum OIM
performance with no significant performance drop up to a MIMO size of 100
transmitting and 100 receiving antennas, thereby making FeFET a suitable device
for this application. Our simulations and associated analysis using the
Kuramoto model of oscillators also predict that this designed classical analog
OIM, if implemented experimentally, will offer logarithmic scaling of
computation time with MIMO size, thereby offering a huge improvement (in terms
of computation speed) over aforementioned MIMO decoders run on conventional
digital hardware.

Abstract: Under the dual background of deep adjustment of global energy pattern and
severe challenges of environmental problems, solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has
become the focus of research on efficient and clean energy conversion
technology due to its many excellent characteristics. The electrochemical
performance of SOFC is affected by various factors such as gas flow pattern
(co-flow, counter-flow, cross-flow), flow rate (cathode and anode channel
gases), and operating voltage. Accurately analysing the variation of
electrochemical indexes with each factor is the basis for proposing the design
scheme of high efficiency reaction of the cell. Therefore, a three-dimensional
multi-field coupling model of SOFC is established in this study, and the model
parameters and boundary conditions covering electrochemistry, gas flow,
substance diffusion, etc. are set to study the influence of the coupling
between factors on the electrochemical performance of the cell. These results
show that with the decrease of operating voltage, the electrochemical reaction
rate of the cell increases significantly, the gas mole fraction gradient
increases, and the inhomogeneity of the electrolyte current density
distribution is enhanced. Under low-voltage operating conditions, the
cross-flow flow pattern shows better electrochemical performance advantages,
and its power density profile takes the lead in different current density
intervals. With the increase of the flow rate of the flow channel gas, the
output power density curve of the cell shows an overall upward trend, and then
the driving effect of the flow rate increase on the power density increase is
gradually weakened due to the saturated cathodic reaction. This study reveals
the influence of the coupling of flow pattern, flow rate and voltage on the
electrochemical performance of SOFC, and provides guidance for the commercial
application of SOFC.

Abstract: Monolithic 3D stackable 1T1C DRAM technology is on the rise, with initial
prototypes reported by the industry. This work presents a comprehensive
reliability study focusing on the intricate interplay between the row hammer
effect and the floating body effect. First, using a TCAD model of a 3D DRAM
mini-array, we categorize different cases of adjacent cells and show that the
notorious row hammer effect induced by charge migration is significantly
mitigated compared to 2D DRAM. However, we found that when incorporating an
impact ionization model to account for the floating body characteristics of the
silicon access transistor, the capacitive coupling between vertically stacked
cells is severely exacerbated. Second, we conduct an in-depth investigation
into the floating body effect itself. We systematically examine the dependence
of this effect on key device parameters, including body thickness, doping
concentration, and gate work function.

Abstract: Recent advances in metamaterials and fabrication techniques have revived
interest in mechanical computing. Contrary to techniques relying on static
deformations of buckling beams or origami-based lattices, the integration of
wave scattering and mechanical memory presents a promising path toward
efficient, low-latency elastoacoustic computing. This work introduces a novel
class of multifunctional mechanical computing circuits that leverage the rich
dynamics of phononic and locally resonant materials. These circuits incorporate
memory-integrated components, realized here via metamaterial cells infused with
shape memory alloys which recall stored elastic profiles and trigger specific
actions upon thermal activation. A critical advantage of this realization is
its synergistic interaction with incident vibroacoustic loads and the inherited
high speed of waves, giving it a notable performance edge over recent
adaptations of mechanically intelligent systems that employ innately slower
mechanisms such as elastomeric shape changes and snap-through bistabilities.
Through a proof-of-concept physical implementation, the efficacy and
reconfigurability of the wave-based gates are demonstrated via output probes
and measured wavefields. Furthermore, the modular design of the fundamental
gates can be used as building blocks to construct complex combinational logic
circuits, paving the way for sequential logic in wave-based analog computing
systems.

Abstract: Germanium-Tin (GeSn) semiconductors are promising for mid-infrared
optoelectronics owing to their silicon compatibility, tunable bandgap, and
potential for room-temperature operation. Released GeSn membranes provide an
additional degree of freedom to extend the operation wavelength through
epitaxial strain relaxation, while their transferability expands design
flexibility. On the other hand, metasurfaces have become an effective strategy
to engineer light--matter interaction, and their integration with
photodetectors can enhance performance and introduce new functionalities. Here,
we demonstrate a mid-infrared photodetector consisting of a transfer-printed
Ge$_{0.89}$Sn$_{0.11}$ membrane integrated with an Au plasmonic metasurface.
The photodetector exhibits a wavelength cutoff exceeding 3.0~$\mu$m with nearly
fourfold increase in responsivity at 2.5~$\mu$m as compared to unreleased
films, attributed to Fabry--P\'erot resonance. Furthermore, the integration
with an anisotropic metasurface yields detectors with strong polarization
sensitivity, achieving a measured contrast ratio of $\sim$4:1 between
orthogonal polarizations. Moreover, the operation wavelength of the
photodetector can be selectively tuned by varying the geometric scale of the
metasurface. The experimental results show excellent agreement with
simulations, confirming the effectiveness and versatility of this integrated
metasurface--membrane design.

Abstract: Controlling the directionality of the acoustic scattering with single
acoustic metaatoms has a key importance for reaching spatial routing of sound
with acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we present the experimental
demonstration of the acoustic analogue of the Kerker effect realized in a
two-dimensional coiled-space metaatom. By engineering the interference between
monopolar and dipolar resonances within a high-index acoustic metaatom, we
achieve directional scattering with suppressed backward or forward response at
the first and second Kerker conditions respectively. Experimental measurements
of the scattered pressure field, in a parallel-plate waveguide environment,
show good agreement with the full-wave simulations. Our results validate the
feasibility of Kerker-inspired wave control in acoustic systems and open new
opportunities for directional sound manipulation.

Abstract: Carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) have been extensively used in the
aerospace and wind energy industries due to their superior specific mechanical
properties and corrosion resistance. However, their higher electrical
resistivity makes them susceptible to lightning strike damage, which
necessitates the addition of a surface lightning strike protection (LSP) layer.
Traditional LSP systems, such as copper mesh or expanded foil, reduce lightning
strike damage, but are not easily drapable around complex geometries and may
introduce delamination-prone regions within the composite. Here, we propose a
novel manufacturing strategy for architected hybrid composites as drapable LSP
by weaving stainless steel yarns within the woven carbon fiber composites. We
varied the metal-to-carbon yarn ratio and stacking configuration to assess
damage evolution under quasi-static arc exposures and simulated lightning
strikes. Our results elucidate that incorporating hybrid layers into composites
significantly reduced surface temperatures, through-thickness damage, and mass
loss under both electric arc impacts. The composites with the proposed LSP
layers also exhibited higher retention of flexural modulus and strength
compared to the reference CFRP. Advanced air mobility (AAM) vehicles, which
operate at lower altitudes, face significant safety challenges due to their
high susceptibility to lightning strikes. Therefore, the proposed hybridized
composites can be used as an efficient and drapable LSP around complex shapes
in AAM vehicles, offering enhanced safety and protection.

Abstract: Graphene is an exceptional platform for spin-based non-volatile memory,
logic, and neuromorphic computing by combining long-distance spin transport
with electrical tunability at room temperature. However, advancing beyond
passive spin channels requires devices capable of generating large spin signals
with efficient rectification capabilities, which are essential for active
spintronic components. Here, we demonstrate a folded-bilayer graphene
spin-valve device with giant non-local spin signals in the several mV range
with pronounced spin-rectification effects. The efficient spin injection
creates a giant spin accumulation of 20 meV, and generates a spin-diode effect
with an asymmetry of over an order of magnitude between forward and reverse
bias conditions. This spin-diode effect arises from the nonlinear coupling
between large spin accumulation and the applied electric field. These large
spin signals, together with the spin-diode effect, are achieved with
folded-bilayer graphene, offering a promising platform for developing active
ultrathin two-dimensional spintronic devices.

Abstract: Fast quasi-adiabatic driving (FAQUAD) is a central technique in shortcuts to
adiabaticity (STA), enabling accelerated adiabatic evolution by optimizing the
rate of change of a single control parameter. However, many realistic systems
are governed by multiple coupled parameters, where the adiabatic condition
depends not only on the local rate of change but also on the path through
parameter space. Here, we introduce an enhanced FAQUAD framework that
incorporates path optimization in addition to conventional velocity
optimization, extending STA control to two-dimensional parameter spaces. We
implement this concept in a coupled elastic-waveguide system, where the
synthetic parameters-detuning and coupling-are controlled by the thicknesses of
the waveguides and connecting bridges. Using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry,
we directly map the flexural-wave field and observe adiabatic energy transfer
along the optimized path in parameter space. This elastic-wave platform
provides a versatile classical analogue for exploring multidimensional
adiabatic control, demonstrating efficient and compact implementation of
shortcut-to-adiabaticity protocols.

TL;DR: 使用4D-STEM技术精确表征聚焦离子束(FIB)的完整点扩散函数，包括传统方法忽略的束尾区域，为精密纳米制造提供更准确的离子-物质相互作用分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聚焦离子束在精密纳米制造中应用广泛，但传统方法只表征束芯区域，低估了完整的点扩散函数范围，特别是在杂质放置等精密任务中，需要准确了解离子-物质相互作用剖面。

Method: 采用四维扫描透射电子显微镜(4D-STEM)，通过会聚束电子衍射(CBED)模式收集已知离子通量校准区域和静态驻留点的衍射图样，使用峰值信噪比(PSNR)进行互相关分析。

Result: 4D-STEM数据集对缺陷定量具有超高灵敏度，比传统暗场成像更能抵抗扫描伪影，能够在低剂量区域全面分析离子诱导损伤，提供更准确的FIB性能表征。

Conclusion: 该方法补充了图像分辨率方法，能够全面分析离子诱导损伤，即使在低剂量区域也能提供更准确的FIB性能表征，支持超越传统仅关注束芯分辨率指标的应用定制。

Abstract: Focused ion beams (FIBs) are widely used in nanofabrication for applications
such as circuit repair, ultra-thin lamella preparation, strain engineering, and
quantum device prototyping. Although the lateral spread of the ion beam is
often overlooked, it becomes critical in precision tasks such as impurity
placement in host substrates, where accurate knowledge of the ion-matter
interaction profile is essential. Existing techniques typically characterise
only the beam core, where most ions land, thus underestimating the full extent
of the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we use four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to resolve the ion beam
tail at defect densities equivalent to $<$0.1 ions nm$^{-2}$. Convergent beam
electron diffraction (CBED) patterns were collected in calibration regions with
known ion fluence and compared to patterns acquired around static dwell spots
exposed to a 30 keV Ga$^{+}$ beam for 1-10 s. Cross-correlation using peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) revealed that 4D-STEM datasets are ultra-sensitive
for defect quantification and more robust against scanning artefacts than
conventional dark-field imaging. This approach is complementary to image
resolution methods enabling a comprehensive profiling of ion-induced damage
even at low-dose regimes, offering a more accurate representation of FIB
performance and supporting application tailoring beyond the conventional
resolution metrics focused solely on the beam core.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习方法（特别是梯度提升技术）改进闪烁体-SiPM粒子探测器的粒子位置和能量沉积估计精度，相比传统分析方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于物理模型的分析算法在粒子位置重建和能量估计方面精度有限，希望通过机器学习方法提升闪烁体-SiPM粒子探测器的性能。

Method: 使用GEANT4模拟宇宙μ子和高能氧离子通过探测器，训练XGBoost和LightGBM模型预测粒子入射位置和沉积能量，并研究混合策略如混合提升和探测方法。

Result: 两种机器学习算法均优于分析基线，探测方法在位置和LET估计方面带来可测量的增益，而混合提升无明显改进。

Conclusion: 机器学习驱动的重建方法显著增强了闪烁体-SiPM粒子探测器的性能。

Abstract: Scintillator-SiPM Particle Detectors (SSPDs) are compact, low-power devices
with applications including particle physics, underground tomography,
cosmic-ray studies, and space instrumentation. They are based on a prism-shaped
scintillator with corner-mounted SiPMs. Previous work has demonstrated that
analytic algorithms based on a physical model of light propagation can
reconstruct particle impinging positions and tracks and estimate deposited
energy and Linear Energy Transfer (LET) with moderate accuracy. In this study,
we enhance this approach by applying machine learning (ML) methods,
specifically gradient boosting techniques, to improve the accuracy of spatial
location and energy deposition estimation. Using the GEANT4 simulation toolkit,
we simulated cosmic muons and energetic oxygen ions traversing an SSPD, we
trained XGBoost and LightGBM models to predict particle impinging positions and
deposited energy. Both algorithms outperformed the analytic baseline. We
further investigated hybrid strategies, including hybrid boosting and probing.
While hybrid boosting provided no significant improvement, probing yielded
measurable gains in both position and LET estimation. These results suggest
that ML-driven reconstruction provides a powerful enhancement to SSPD
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够快速模拟探测器光子簇射的生成模型，解决传统模拟方法计算成本高的问题，同时实现全角度覆盖和位置无关的训练数据。

Method: 使用点云模型结合角度条件生成技术，通过位置无关的训练数据训练模型，并对预处理和超参数进行激进优化以提升推理速度。

Conclusion: CaloClouds3展示了点云模型在探测器模拟中的潜力，实现了快速、灵活的光子簇射生成，为物理性能评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: We present CaloClouds3, a model for the fast simulation of photon showers in
the barrel of a high granularity detector. This iteration demonstrates for the
first time how a pointcloud model can employ angular conditioning to replicate
photons at all incident angles. Showers produced by this model can be used
across the whole detector barrel, due to specially produced position agnostic
training data. With this flexibility, the model is usable in a full simulation
and reconstruction chain, which offers a further handle for evaluating physics
performance of the model. As inference time is a crucial consideration for a
generative model, the pre-processing and hyperparameters are aggressively
optimised, achieving a speed up factor of two orders of magnitude over Geant4
at inference.
