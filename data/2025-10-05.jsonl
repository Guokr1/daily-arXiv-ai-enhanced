Whilst the narrative of our home as a 'humdrum' system has\nbecome ingrained in the public psyche via Sagan, there are at least two\nstriking facts about our existence which we know are certainly unusual. First,\nthe stelliferous period spans ~10Tyr - yet here we are living in the first 0.1%\nof that volume. Second, over three-quarters of all stars are low-mass M-dwarfs,\nstars with no shortage of rocky habitable-zone planets - and yet, again, our\nexistence defies this trend, previously dubbed the Red Sky Paradox. Two\nplausible resolutions are that a) stars below a certain mass, $M_{crit}$, do\nnot produce observers, and, b) planets have a truncated temporal window for\nobservers, $T_{win}$, negating the longevity advantage of M-dwarfs. We develop\na Bayesian model that encompasses both datums and jointly explores the two\nresolutions covariantly. Our analysis reveals that 1) the hypothesis that these\nobservations are mere luck is disfavored with an overwhelming Bayes factor of\n~1600; 2) some truncation of low-mass stars is indispensable, lowering\n$T_{win}$ alone cannot well-explain the observations; and, 3) the most\nconservative limit on $M_{crit}$ occurs when fixing $T_{win}=10$Gyr, yielding\n$M_{crit}>0.34 M_{\\odot}$ [$0.74 M_{\\odot}$] to 2$\\sigma$ [1$\\sigma$]. Our work\nchallenges the tacit assumption of M-dwarfs being viable seats for observers\nand, indirectly, even life."}

Analytical studies\nof such effects are possible within the geometrical optics approximation, where\nthe medium introduces additional light bending due to refraction. These studies\ntypically assume a cold non-magnetized plasma, for which light propagation is\nindependent of the medium's velocity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to\nthe general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its\ninfluence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary\nspacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between\nrotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the\nmedium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane\nof a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium.\nAssuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic\ntreatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational\nmotion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we\nanalyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly\ninteresting results. First, we show that, to the first order in the medium's\nvelocity, the radial motion does not affect the light deflection. Second,\nassuming slow rotation of the gravitating object, we demonstrate that the black\nhole rotation and the medium motion can produce equivalent observational\nsignatures. We find the quantitative condition under which these effects\ncompensate each other. This relation becomes particularly clear for a Kerr\nblack hole, discussed as an example."}

Especially below 100 MHz,\nphase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can\ncomplicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address\nthis challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays\nfrom ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions\nencountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique:\nwe modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von\nMises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from\n$2\\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less\nheavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method\nreliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in\ntime whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the\nclock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing\nshows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the\nold algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even\nunder good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides\nreliable solutions across a wider range of conditions. Conclusions: This new\nalgorithm represents a significant advance for large-scale surveys, offering a\nmore dependable way to study ionospheric effects and furthering research in\nionospheric science and low-frequency radio astronomy."}
