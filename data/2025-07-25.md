### [1] [Effective Pressure of the FRW Universe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17789)
*Shi-Bei Kong*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了$N$维FRW宇宙在爱因斯坦引力、高斯-博内引力和洛弗洛克引力中的有效压力，发现其行为因维度和引力理论而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同引力理论中FRW宇宙的有效压力特性，揭示其与维度和引力理论的关系。

Method: 通过定义有效压力$P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$，分析其在爱因斯坦引力、高斯-博内引力和洛弗洛克引力中的表现。

Result: 有效压力在爱因斯坦引力中为负且随视界半径减小；在高斯-博内引力中（$N\geq6$）有最小值且非恒负；洛弗洛克引力中可出现多个零点和极值点。

Conclusion: 有效压力与维度及引力理论密切相关，且在特定条件下等同于完美流体的普通压力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the effective pressure of the $N$-dimensional
FRW(Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe in Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet
gravity, and Lovelock gravity. The effective pressure is defined by
$P_{eff}:=-dE/dV$, where $E=\rho V$ is the effective energy and $V$ is the
volume of the FRW universe inside the apparent horizon. The effective pressure
in Einstein gravity is always negative and its absolute value decreases with
the horizon radius $R_A$. The effective pressure in Gauss-Bonnet gravity is
different with the one in Einstein gravity only when $N\geq6$, and in this
case, the effective pressure is not always negative and has a minimum. The
effective pressure in Lovelock gravity can have multiple zero-points and
extreme points. The effective pressure in different dimensions has interesting
relations. We also find that under certain condition, the effective pressure is
equivalent with the `ordinary' pressure $p$ of the perfect fluid, and this
condition do not depend on the specific choice of gravitational theories.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and
limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric
teleparallel gravity. In Chapter2, we analyze the cosmological implications of
$f(T,\mathcal{T})$ theory by considering the squared-torsion model
$f(T,\mathcal{T})= \alpha \mathcal{T}+ \beta T^2$, where $T$ represents torsion
and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In Chapter3, we
explore the inflationary scenario within the framework of torsion-trace
coupling gravity, utilizing a Lagrangian density derived from a function
denoted as $f(T,\mathcal{T})$. In Chapter4, we aim to investigate the dark
sector of the Universe, which encompasses the enigmatic components of the Dark
Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We consider an extended form of the Equation
of State (EoS) for DM, widely known as the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensation
(EBEC) EoS for DM. In Chapter5, we propose an extended formulation of symmetric
teleparallel gravity by generalizing the gravitational Lagrangian through the
inclusion of an arbitrary function of $f(Q,\mathcal{T_{\mu\nu}}
\mathcal{T^{\mu\nu}})$. We derived the FRW equations for a flat, homogeneous,
and isotropic spacetime. In Chapter6, we delved into the dark sector of the
Universe, specifically focusing on DM and DE. We examine an extended version of
the EoS for DM, commonly referred to EBEC EoS for DM, given as $p=\alpha \rho +
\beta \rho^2$, alongside the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian given by $f(Q)= \gamma
Q^2$.

Abstract: We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at
fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes

conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the
bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known
algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the
Penrose inequality, to include their derivatives.

Result: 成功获得无需奇异物质的可穿越虫洞解，有效违反零能量条件。

Conclusion: 双曲对称性为构造可穿越虫洞提供新途径，无需依赖奇异物质，扩展了虫洞研究的可能性。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of exact solutions for traversable wormhole
geometries in a static and hyperbolic symmetric spacetime. In the conventional
form of studying wormhole geometry, traversability requires the presence of
exotic matter, which also provides negative gravity effects to keep the
wormhole throat open. Using hyperbolic symmetry we obtain a solution already
provided with negative energy density that replaces this effect and allows us
to derive wormhole geometries that effectively violate the null energy
condition. To achieve this goal, we use a generalized complexity factor for
hyperbolic symmetry adapted to study wormhole geometries and with a suitable
redshift function in order to construct a Casimir-like traversable hyperbolic
wormhole. A detailed study has been conducted on the behavior of the matter
sector, the energy conditions, and the traversability conditions.

### [5] [Updated constraints on modified gravity from binary pulsars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18188)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用TEMPO2软件、MCMC4Tempo2插件和统一的Python流程分析数据，提取开普勒和后开普勒参数，结合多个双星系统数据进行联合分析。

Result: 对PSR J1713+0747的分析显示，G的时间变化率在95%置信水平下为(0.32±0.31)×10^-12 yr^-1，偶极辐射参数κ_D为(-0.04±0.14)×10^-4，结果与广义相对论一致。

Conclusion: 通过高精度数据，论文提供了对修正引力理论关键参数的更新约束，结果支持广义相对论。

Abstract: Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity
(GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative
theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a
time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar
gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,
namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the
Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital
dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian
parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do
this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python
pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different
binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and
the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars
(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times
10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint
on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times
10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide
updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we
find that our results are consistent with GR.

### [6] [Primordial black hole formation in matter domination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18312)
*Ehsan Ebrahimian,Ali Akbar Abolhasani,Mehrdad Mirbabayi*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了在物质主导时期由原始波动坍缩形成的原始黑洞（PBHs），发现其形成阈值与峰的形状密切相关，有效阈值高于极端情况下的理论值，且需要较大的原始波动幅度，导致PBH形成效率仅略高于辐射主导时期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨物质主导时期原始黑洞的形成机制及其与波动形状和幅度的关系，以评估其形成效率。

Method: 通过分析峰的形状分布和速度分散的增长，计算PBH的形成阈值和自旋参数。

Result: 发现有效阈值高于理论值，且需要较大的原始波动幅度（ζ_rms∼10^-1），PBH形成效率仅略高于辐射主导时期，自旋参数较小。

Conclusion: 物质主导时期的PBH形成效率较低，且需要较大的原始波动幅度，其自旋参数略高于辐射主导时期形成的PBH。

Abstract: We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare
primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The
collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as
they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat
perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the
growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the
initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$.
Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic
cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th}
\sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim
10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales.
Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than
Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be
$a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed
in Radiation Domination.

### [7] [Correlation and Redundancy of Time-Delay Interferometry Configurations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18397)
*Gang Wang*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 比较了多种第二代TDI配置的性能，发现低频下表现相似，高频下短时间跨度的PD4L方案表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同TDI配置的性能差异，为未来空间引力波任务设计提供参考。

Method: 对比分析多种代表性TDI配置在不同时间跨度和频段下的表现。

Result: 低频下各配置性能相近，高频下短时间跨度的PD4L方案更优。

Conclusion: PD4L方案因高频性能优越，是未来任务的理想选择。

Abstract: Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational
wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the
required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of
second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different
combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a
comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying
time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly
correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the
low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are
nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies,
where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime,
shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate
waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast,
configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the
Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation
effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and
analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become
effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time
domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior
performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future
space-based GW mission designs.

### [8] [New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18322)
*Selin Aşmanoğlu,Jens Boos,Christopher D. Carone*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了满足限制曲率条件的非奇异黑洞模型，探讨其对黑洞质量、温度、寿命及暗物质比例的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索黑洞质量与调节器尺度对黑洞热力学和霍金辐射的影响，特别是在原始黑洞暗物质背景下的观测效应。

Method: 采用具有德西特和闵可夫斯基核心的模型，分析调节器对黑洞质量范围、温度、比热和寿命的影响。

Result: 发现调节器尺度会影响黑洞的质量范围和暗物质比例限制，尤其是对伽马射线背景的观测约束。

Conclusion: 非奇异黑洞模型在调节器尺度较大时，可能对原始黑洞暗物质的观测和理论产生显著影响。

Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy
the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always
sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole
mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist
while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been
shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an
astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that
substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole
thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of
primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and
Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these
metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole
temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black
hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic
gamma ray background.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用Gaia任务的高精度天体测量数据探测随机引力波背景的方法，重点分析了相对天体测量法的理论可行性及其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过Gaia任务的高精度数据，研究引力波对恒星位置的微小影响，探索相对天体测量法在探测随机引力波背景中的潜力。

Method: 计算了相对天体测量法的天体测量响应和重叠减少函数，并通过Fisher矩阵分析比较了相对与绝对天体测量法的灵敏度。

Result: 相对天体测量法对近距离恒星对的灵敏度有限，而大角距恒星对虽理论上更灵敏，但受限于Gaia的扫描规律。结合脉冲星计时阵列可略微提高高频段的灵敏度。

Conclusion: 相对天体测量法理论可行，但实际应用中存在局限性；结合其他观测手段可提升探测能力。

Abstract: Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of
stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the
observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these
apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision
and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a
stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the
two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although
Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal
plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit
the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can
be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which
effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute
the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative
astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the
literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of
relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis
shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is
limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs
with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are
practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate
that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays
leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than
approximately 10^-7 Hz.

### [10] [Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18345)
*Etera R. Livine,Yuki Yokokura*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文将广义相对论中的爱因斯坦方程转化为一维力学系统，通过耦合经典或量子物质场，生成非零有效哈密顿量，展示了黑洞内部结构的量子效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究广义相对论中球对称静态时空的动力学，探索量子修正对黑洞内部结构的影响。

Method: 将几何部分建模为一维力学系统，利用Misner-Sharp质量和拉普拉斯作为共轭变量，耦合物质场生成有效哈密顿量。

Result: 发现无奇点的黑洞解，由量子物质稳定，从负Ricci标量过渡到外部Schwarzschild度量。

Conclusion: 为自引力致密天体内部结构的半经典修正和量子效应建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric
static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial
coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical
system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate
variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or
quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general
relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to
non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism
through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians
describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with
linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians
that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to
renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the
singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free
black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning
from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside
Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both
semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure
of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.

### [11] [Topological dark energy from spacetime foam: A challenge for $Λ$CDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18389)
*Fotios K. Anagnostopoulos,Stylianos A. Tsilioukas,Emmanuel N. Saridakis*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑暗能量（TDE）的模型，通过时空泡沫和欧几里得量子引力技术，优于标准的ΛCDM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种新的暗能量模型，通过拓扑非平凡解（如瞬子）来改进数据拟合效率，并允许暗能量在宇宙演化中改变符号。

Method: 利用爱因斯坦-高斯-博内引力理论，计算瞬子密度，推导出拓扑诱导的有效暗能量密度演化方程。

Result: TDE模型在平坦和非平坦情况下均优于ΛCDM，并通过了BBN约束。

Conclusion: TDE模型在统计上显著优于ΛCDM，且不影响宇宙的热历史。

Abstract: Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean
Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological
Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with
regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam
level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the
particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective
dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the
latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can
immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of
the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this
TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic
evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We
confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with
Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations
(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model
selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but
statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we
show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.

Motivation: 探讨宇宙初始阶段中重力、电磁、弱和强相互作用系统的稳定性。

Result: 证明了Kasner指数在该机制下的非线性稳定性。

Conclusion: 将Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck的结果扩展到更复杂的Vlasov场系统。

Abstract: In $3+1$ dimensions, we study the stability of Kasner solutions for the
Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field-Vlasov system. This system incorporates gravity,
electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions for the initial stage of our
universe. Due to the presence of the Vlasov field, various new challenges
arise. By observing detailed mathematical structures and designing new delicate
arguments, we identify a new strong sub-critical regime and prove the nonlinear
stability with Kasner exponents lying in this full regime. This extends the
result of Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck [8] from the Einstein-scalar field
system to the physically more complex system with the Vlasov field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示天文研究资金分配的不平衡，尤其是对外星智能研究的忽视，尽管公众和科学家对此有浓厚兴趣。

Method: 通过分析资金分配、公众调查数据和心理学研究，论证了外星智能研究的科学价值和公众需求。

Result: 研究发现资金分配与科学价值和公众兴趣不符，且人类对外星接触的适应性被低估。

Conclusion: 结论是应重新考虑资金优先顺序，建立全面的外星智能研究计划，以推动科学发现和满足公众兴趣。

Abstract: We examine the funding disparity in astronomical research priorities: the
Habitable Worlds Observatory is planned to receive over $10 billion over the
next two decades whereas extraterrestrial intelligence research receives nearly
zero federal funding. This imbalance is in contrast to both scientific value
and public interest, as 65% of Americans and 58.2% of surveyed astrobiologists
believe extraterrestrial intelligence exists. Empirical psychological research
demonstrates that humanity possesses greater resilience toward extraterrestrial
contact than historically recognized. Contemporary studies reveal adaptive
responses rather than mass panic, conflicting with the rationale for excluding
extraterrestrial intelligence research from federal funding since 1993. The
response to the recent interstellar object 3I/ATLAS exemplifies consequences of
this underinvestment: despite discovery forecasts of a new interstellar object
every few months for the coming decade, no funded missions exist to intercept
or closely study these visitors from outside the Solar System. We propose
establishing a comprehensive research program to explore both biosignatures and
technosignatures on interstellar objects. This program would address profound
public interest while advancing detection capabilities and enabling potentially
transformative discoveries in the search for extraterrestrial life. The
systematic exclusion of extraterrestrial intelligence research represents
institutional bias rather than scientific limitation, requiring immediate
reconsideration of funding priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模天文调查产生的复杂数据集对传统分析方法提出了挑战，需要新的机器学习技术来处理。

Method: 使用长短期记忆自动编码器（LSTM-AE）将多色测光数据视为波长序列，编码到二维潜在空间，并结合多种数据源进行分析。

Result: 对3,112,259颗恒星的重建结果显示，99.51%的恒星SED形状误差小于0.05星等，模型具有去噪能力并能检测稀有恒星类型。

Conclusion: LSTM-AE方法在多波段测光数据分析中表现出色，能够重建SED、去噪并检测稀有恒星类型，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Observational astronomy has undergone a significant transformation driven by
large-scale surveys, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response
System (Pan-STARRS) Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and the Gaia
Mission. These programs yield large, complex datasets that pose significant
challenges for conventional analysis methods, and as a result, many different
machine learning techniques are being tested and deployed. We introduce a new
approach to analyzing multiband photometry by using a long-short term memory
autoencoder (LSTM-AE). This model views mean measurements of multicolor
photometry as a sequence in wavelength in order to encode patterns present in
the stars' spectral energy distributions (SEDs) into a two-dimensional latent
space. We showcase this by using Pan-STARRS grizy mean magnitudes, and we use
globular clusters, labels from SIMBAD, Gaia DR3 parallaxes, and PanSTARRS
images to aid our analysis and understanding of the latent space. For 3,112,259
stars in an annulus around the North Galactic Cap, 99.51% have their full SED
shape reconstructed--that is the absolute difference between the observed and
the model predicted magnitude in every band--within five hundredths of a
magnitude. We show that the model likely denoises photometric data, potentially
improving the quality of measurements. Lastly, we show that the detection of
rare stellar types can be performed by analyzing poorly reconstructed
photometry.

sides, respectively. OBSIDs identified the observations, and we had 80 and 161
OBSIDs to be reprocessed at the end of the commissioning period and performance
verification and calibration period, respectively. The combination of the
containerized PPL utilizing Singularity of a container platform running on the
JAXA's "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system and working disk
images formatted to ext3 accomplished a 33x speedup in PPL tasks over our
regular VM. Herein, we briefly describe the data processing in XRISM and our
porting strategies for PPL in the HPC environment.

Antarctic ice. The system comprises nearly 2,000 cameras and illumination LEDs,
which are present on every D-Egg and mDOM, the newly designed optical modules

Abstract: The SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS), a subsystem of
the Aditya Solar wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) onboard India's Aditya-L1
satellite, is designed to study different aspects of energetic particles in the
interplanetary medium from the Sun-Earth L1 point using six detector units
oriented in different directions. This article presents details of the one-year
operation (08 January 2024 - 28 February 2025) of the AL1-ASPEX-STEPS after the
insertion of the satellite into the final halo orbit around the L1 point with
emphasis on performance, science observations, and scientific potentials. Four
out of six AL1-ASPEX-STEPS units exhibit a stable detector response throughout
the observation period, confirming operational robustness. This work also
includes the temporal variation of particle fluxes, spectra of ions during
selected quiet times and transient events, and cross-comparisons with existing
instruments at the L1 point. A strong correlation (with coefficient of
determination, R2 ~ 0.9) is observed in the cross-comparison study,
establishing the reliability of the AL1- ASPEX-STEPS observations.
AL1-ASPEX-STEPS also captures different forms of energetic ion spectra similar
to those observed by previous missions. These results underscore the
instrument's potential to contribute significantly to the study of energetic
particle acceleration, transport, and long-term space weather monitoring from
the Sun-Earth L1 vantage point.

TL;DR: SPLENDOR是一种新型探测器平台，结合窄带半导体靶材和低噪声电荷读出技术，用于探测暗物质能量沉积，灵敏度低于eV级。其模块化设计支持多种靶材和读出技术，并计划通过量子传感升级实现亚电子分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索暗物质，尤其是在亚MeV质量范围内的参数空间，需要高灵敏度和方向性探测技术。SPLENDOR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用强关联f电子半导体（如Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$）和低温高电子迁移率晶体管（cryoHEMT）放大器，实现亚eV能量阈值和方向性灵敏度。

Result: 原型探测器在硅测试样品中实现了20±7电子的电荷分辨率，验证了架构可行性，并展示了在高低背景环境下的灵敏度预测。

Conclusion: SPLENDOR为暗物质探测提供了新方法，结合量子传感和材料设计，有望在亚MeV质量范围内取得突破。

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector
platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge
readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV
scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to
accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies.
SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated
f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not
only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming
dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily
modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic
high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching
single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of
Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype
detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier
chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon
test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a
demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment
in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results.
Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of
athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background
environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing
performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our
ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR
provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing
with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass
range of dark matter parameter space.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大似然估计的多参数联合重建方法，用于高纯锗探测器的三维位置重建，显著降低了噪声敏感性和系统偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在独立重建各维度位置时存在噪声敏感性和系统偏差问题，需要更稳健的方法。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的多参数联合重建方法，并使用积分型参数以减少电子噪声影响。

Result: 在100 keV光子下，Z方向最大重建偏差从0.4 mm降至0.02 mm，X/Y方向从0.4 mm降至0.016 mm，分辨率在Z方向为0.07-0.16 mm，X/Y方向为0.07-0.44 mm。

Conclusion: 该方法为高纯锗探测器的三维位置重建提供了有效解决方案，适用于医学成像和伽马射线天文等领域。

Abstract: Orthogonal-strip planar high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors can
reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) positions of photon interactions through
analysis of parameters extracted from multiple charge signals. The conventional
method independently reconstructs positions in each dimension using
amplitude-based parameters, leading to noise sensitivity and systematic biases.
In this study, we propose a multi-parameter-joint reconstruction method based
on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) which establishes a mapping between
pulse shape parameters and corresponding 3D positions. To mitigate the effects
of electronic noise, we employ integral-based parameters. The reconstruction
performance was evaluated using pulse shape simulations. For 100 keV photons
under 1 keV root-mean-square (RMS) electronic noise, the maximum Z
reconstruction bias was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.02 mm in the central region
and from 2 mm to 0.15 mm near the electrodes. The maximum reconstruction bias
in the X/Y directions was reduced from 0.4 mm to 0.016 mm. Furthermore, the use
of integral-based parameters mitigated the rapid degradation of resolution
under high-noise conditions. The achieved position resolution ranged from 0.07
mm to 0.16 mm in the Z directions and from 0.07 mm to 0.44 mm in the X/Y
direction. This method offers a promising approach to 3D position
reconstruction with HPGe detectors for applications such as medical imaging and
gamma-ray astronomy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面引力波探测器在30 Hz以下频率的主要噪声源是控制引起的位移噪声，而紧凑激光干涉传感器是改进局部位移传感的主要候选方案。

Method: 通过在HRTS系统上安装COBRIs，测量光学腔长度稳定性，模拟噪声水平，并分析干涉传感器阻尼的影响。

Conclusion: 实验设计展示了COBRIs在低频位移传感中的潜力，但仍需改进测试设施以进一步验证其性能。

Abstract: One of the limiting noise sources of ground-based gravitational wave
detectors at frequencies below 30 Hz is control-induced displacement noise.
Compact laser interferometric sensors are a prime candidate for improved local
displacement sensing. In this paper we present the design of an experiment that
aims to demonstrate the advantages of interferometric sensors over shadow
sensors. We focus on the compact balanced readout interferometer (COBRI) - a
sensor currently in development that is based on deep frequency modulation. We
mount COBRIs on two HAM Relay Triple Suspension (HRTS) systems that suspend two
mirrors forming an optical cavity. By measuring the length stability of this
cavity relative to a stable reference we aim to probe the direct motion
reduction when using COBRIs for active damping and we aim to investigate their
behavior and auxiliary functions, such as absolute ranging, in the context of
the 6 degree-of-freedom controls of the suspensions. Here we describe the
design of the experiment and simulations of the achievable noise levels that
were obtained using mechanical models of the HRTS suspensions. We discuss all
relevant noise sources, the modeled influence of the interferometric sensor
damping and the current limitations and necessary improvements of our testing
facility in terms of seismic pre-isolation to achieve a shadow sensor limited
noise at around 5 Hz, where, according to our simulations, we can demonstrate
superior performance for COBRIs in the longitudinal degree of freedom.

Abstract: The performance of amorphous selenium (a-Se) as a cryogenic photodetector
material is evaluated through a series of experiments using laterally
structured devices operated in a custom optical test stand. These studies
investigate the response of a-Se detectors to low-photon fluxes at high
electric fields near avalanche conditions, the linearity of the photoconductive
response over a wide dynamic range and the direct detection of narrowband 130
nm vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) illumination. At 87 K, matched-filter analysis
shows reliable single-shot detection with efficiencies greater than or equal to
80 percent and area under the curve (AUC) greater than or equal to 0.85 using
as few as approximately 6800 incident 401 nm photons, corresponding to
approximately 3400 photons within field-active regions after accounting for
geometric constraints. Measurements are performed at cryogenic temperatures
using calibrated photon fluxes derived from a silicon photomultiplier reference
and a characterized optical filter stack. Additional experiments using a
tellurium-doped a-Se (a-SeTe) device explore the material's behavior under
identical test conditions and demonstrate that avalanche is achievable in
a-SeTe at cryogenic temperatures. The results demonstrate reproducible
low-noise operation, VUV sensitivity and field-dependent gain behavior in a
lateral a-Se architecture, representing the first reported observation of
avalanche multiplication in laterally structured a-Se and a-SeTe devices at
cryogenic temperatures. These findings support the potential integration of
laterally structured a-Se devices into next-generation pixelated liquid-argon
time projection chambers (TPCs) requiring scalable, high-field-compatible
photon detection systems.
