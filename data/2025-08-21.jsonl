The proposed method is based on the\naccurate reconstruction of the response function using a surrogate model. The\nresulting model is convoluted with the (normalized) expected/measured neutron\nspectrum to obtain an effective measure of the bubble detector's response,\nherein referred to as effective $c$ or $c_\\text{eff}$. This effective value for\nthe response is energy-independent after the convolution. In this way, our\napproach includes the spectral distribution of neutrons arriving at the\ndetector to determine the integral neutron flux. Analyzing our experimental\nresults obtained at the DRACO PW laser and comparing the results to previously\nused methods to obtain neutron fluxes from bubble detectors returns a reduction\nin neutron flux of up to \\SI{31}{\\%}.

To date, most studies\nhave focused on systems with subsonic modulation, where the phase velocity of\nthe modulation wave is lower than that of the guided elastic waves. In\ncontrast, wave propagation under supersonic modulation remains largely\nunexplored, and the associated nonreciprocal phenomena present an open\nchallenge. In this work, we investigate the dynamic response of elastic\nlongitudinal waves propagating through a spatially bounded medium subjected to\nsupersonic modulation of its elastic properties. We show that supersonic\nmodulation gives rise to directional wavenumber bandgaps in the dispersion\ndiagram, characterized by vanishing wavenumbers. Using a theoretical framework\nbased on mode-coupling theory, we reveal how supersonic modulation governs\namplitude modulation and frequency conversion in wave transmission and\nreflection at spatial interfaces. This leads to nonreciprocal parametric\namplification and frequency conversion, phenomena not previously reported in\nbounded elastic media. Remarkably, the observed parametric amplification is not\ndriven by an imaginary component of the wavenumber, but instead arises from the\ninterference between counter-propagating Floquet-Bloch modes at spatial\ninterfaces. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical predictions and\nillustrate nonreciprocal amplification and frequency conversion effects. Our\nfindings pave the way for the design of nonreciprocal elastic wave devices with\nadvanced functionalities such as signal processing, energy amplification, and\nfrequency conversion."}

This\ndirectional dependence effectively breaks reciprocity, where the operational\nbandwidth is defined by the synchronization region (Arnold tongue), and can be\nbroader than resonance based methods.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in symmetric\nteleparallel gravity incorporating a parity-violating (PV) term and a\nnon-minimally coupled boundary term. The presence of this non-minimally coupled\nboundary term help to avoid the strong coupling problem inherent in PV\nsymmetric teleparallel gravity, thereby enabling our study of the SIGWs in this\nPV symmetric teleparallel gravity. We calculate the SIGWs generated during the\nradiation-dominated era and compute the corresponding energy density spectrum\nwith a monochromatic primordial power spectrum, numerically. The resulting\nenergy density spectrum of SIGWs exhibits significant deviations from that is\npredicted by general relativity, particularly at high frequencies. This\ndifferent feature is detectable by future space-based GW detectors like LISA,\nTianQin and Taiji."}

It turns out that the relative timing\nof formation of trapped surfaces and the singularity plays a crucial role here.\nThe dynamics of apparent horizon governs the visibility of singularity, and we\ncharacterize precise conditions here for spherically symmetric collapse with a\ngeneral type-I matter field. This is done in terms of the existence of outgoing\nnull geodesic families from the central singularity.
