We present an extension of the\nFlexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves\n(GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of\nGR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN)\ncoefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time-\nand frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying\npotential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing\nformula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian\napproaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on\ndeviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most\nrecent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW\nphases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter\nspace with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\\odot}$, the optimal regime for\ntesting deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the\nstrength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and\nthe SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown\ncontributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between\ninspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these\ninspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of\nrobust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of\ngravity and BHs with GW observations."}

DLC is\na promising material for UCN transport and storage due to its high Fermi\npotential, low neutron absorption, and low depolarization probabilities. First\ncoating attempts on a full length aluminum UCN guide were successfully coated\nwith densities of 2.2-2.3 g/cm$^3$, corresponding to Fermi potentials of\n198-207 neV as measured by X-ray reflectometry (XRR).

KIDs spanning 210 - 850 GHz across seven instrument\nmodules will be deployed in the Prime-Cam instrument of CCAT Observatory's Fred\nYoung Submillimeter Telescope at an elevation of 5600 m on Cerro Chajnantor in\nChile's Atacama Desert. The natural frequency-division multiplexed readout of\nKIDs allows hundreds of detectors to be coupled to a single radio frequency\n(RF) transmission line, but requires sophisticated warm readout electronics.\nThe FPGA-based Xilinx ZCU111 radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) offers a\npromising and flexible solution to the challenge of warm readout. CCAT uses\ncustom packaged RFSoCs to read out KIDs in the Prime-Cam instrument. Each RFSoC\ncan simultaneously read out four RF channels with up to 1,000 detectors\nspanning a 512 MHz bandwidth per channel using the current firmware. We use\nfive RFSoCs to read out the >10,000 KIDs in the broadband 280 GHz instrument\nmodule inside a testbed receiver.

We also present the preliminary\naveraged spectral responses of the 280 GHz instrument module using KIDs from\nthe TiN array and the first Al array as a demonstration of the end-to-end\nperformance of the readout and optical systems. These measurements demonstrate\nthe foundation that will enable us to simultaneously read out over 10,000 KIDs\nwith the RFSoC and represent a critical step toward reading out the ~100,000\nKIDs in Prime-Cam in its future full capacity configuration."}

Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that\ncould not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the\npossibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian\nnoise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest.\nWe present evidence for a population of \\textit{microglitches} in LIGO\ngravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter\nestimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123.

On-chip filterbank spectrometers are a promising\ntechnology in this respect; however, they must overcome an orders-of-magnitude\nincrease in detector counts, efficiency loss due to dielectric properties, and\nstringent fabrication tolerances that currently limit scaling to resolutions of\norder 1000 over a large array. We propose coupling a medium-resolution Fourier\ntransform spectrometer to a low-resolution filterbank spectrometer focal plane,\nwhich serves as a post-dispersion element. In this arrangement, medium\nresolution imaging spectroscopy is provided by the Fourier transform\nspectrometer, while the low resolution filterbank spectrometer serves to\ndecrease the photon noise inherent in typical broadband Fourier transform\nspectrometer measurements by over an order of magnitude. This is achieved while\nmaintaining the excellent imaging advantages of both architectures. We present\npredicted mapping speeds for a filterbank-dispersed Fourier transform\nspectrometer from a ground-based site and a balloon-borne platform. We also\ndemonstrate the potential that an instrument of this type has for an R~1000\nline intensity mapping experiment using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as an\nexample platform.

However, in all\ncases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the\npermanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a\nno-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear\ngravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate\nfractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of\nGeneral Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional\nconsistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the\nabsence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D>4$."}

Through analytical integrations of\nthe kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We\nfind that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM),\nuniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT)\ngauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\\eta^n$, where\n$n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal\n(Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges\nthe late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For\nsubhorizon modes ($ k\\eta \\gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that\nSIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a\nkernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational\nwave components (oscillating as $\\sin(k\\eta)$ and $\\cos(k\\eta)$), eliminating\nspurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\\eta)^{-1} $ and\nyields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only\nluminal modes represent physical SIGWs."}

Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended\nSchwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage\nof expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates.\nIts main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer\nrepresented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal\nstructure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a\ncompelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems -\nincluding those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it\nexhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's\noriginal r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's\nlight cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres.\nThe proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's\nsix-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that\nexists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit\n(Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that\nis well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks\non general relativity."}
