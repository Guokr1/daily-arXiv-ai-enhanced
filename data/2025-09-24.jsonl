(2025)], we developed the performance\noptimization framework spectre-ml for gamma spectrometers with variable\nperformance across many readout channels.

In this work, we integrate the pyGEM\nuranium enrichment assay code with our spectre-ml framework, and show that the\nU-235 enrichment relative uncertainty can be directly used as an optimization\ntarget. We find that this optimization reduces relative uncertainties after a\n30-minute measurement by an average of 20%, as tested on six different H3D M400\nCdZnTe spectrometers, which can significantly improve uranium non-destructive\nassay measurement times in nuclear safeguards contexts.

This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour\nsearches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new\n``particle-mesh-particle'' interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh\nmethod for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first,\nquantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy,\nand momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink --\nare deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple\ncontributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then\ncommunicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer\nstates are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to\nenforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme\nin the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its\napplication to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion.

The upgrade\nincorporates a static atmospheric dispersion corrector (ADC) using Ohara i-line\nglasses (BAL15Y and S-FPL51Y), carefully selected for high internal\ntransmission (> 99\\%), and optimized to improve throughput and image quality\nacross the 360 - 1000 nm band. The ADC consists of two identical Amici prisms,\nfixed at an orientation optimized for the HET's nominal zenith angle\n(35\\textdegree), correcting dispersion over the HET zenith range of\n26.5\\textdegree to 43.5\\textdegree. Relay optics were optimized to improve blue\nend sensitivity and maintain substantially sub-fiber-core RMS spot radii across\nthe full field of view. Simulations, including atmospheric dispersion modeling\nin ZEMAX show residual dispersion $\\le$ 0.42\" considering the entire range of\nwavelengths and zenith distances, with transmission efficiency of 91 to 94\\%.\nWe also discuss how the mechanical design integrates all optical elements,\nincluding the ADC, in a rigid, modular input head assembly mounted in the HET\nPrime Focus Instrument Package (PFIP). This optimized fiber feed enhances\ncoupling efficiency, improves S/N in the blue, and enables higher radial\nvelocity precision , maintaining HET - HRS as a leading facility for high -\nresolution spectroscopy."}

The Dirac-Bergmann analysis has revealed a violation of local\nLorentz invariance in NGR. We review the recent status of NGR, considering the\nresults of its Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We then reconsider the vierbein\nperturbation framework and identify the origin of each perturbation field in\nthe vierbein field components. This identification is mandatory for adequately\nfixing gauges while guaranteeing consistency with the invariance guaranteed by\nthe Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We find that the spatially flat gauge is adequate\nfor analyzing a theory with the violation of local Lorentz invariance. Based on\nthe established vierbein perturbative framework, introducing a real scalar\nfield as a test matter, we perform a second-order perturbative analysis of NGR\nwith respect to tensor, scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector and pseudo-vector\nmodes. We reveal the possible propagating modes of each type of NGR.

In contrast to the fluid particles of this perfect fluid\nspacetime which follow non-geodesic world-lines and escape to infinity, we\nprove that freely-falling test particles of McVittie spacetime can reach the\nblack hole horizon in finite proper time. We review the relevant evidence and\nargue that the fate of an extended test body is less clear. More precisely: we\nconsider expanding McVittie spacetimes with a non-negative cosmological\nconstant. In each member of this class, we identify a region of the spacetime\nsuch that an observer following an initially-ingoing timelike geodesic crosses\nthe black hole horizon of the spacetime in a finite amount of proper time. The\ncurvature behaves in interesting ways along these geodesics. In the case of a\npositive cosmological constant, curvature scalars (of zero, first and second\norder in derivatives), Jacobi fields and parallel propagated (p.p.) frame\ncomponents of the curvature remain finite along timelike geodesics running into\nthe black hole horizon. For a vanishing cosmological constant, scalar curvature\nterms of zero and first order as well as Jacobi fields remain finite in this\nlimit. However, scalar curvature terms of second order diverge, and we show\nthat there are p.p.\\ frame components of the curvature tensor that also diverge\nin this limit. We argue that this casts a doubt as to whether or not an\nextended test body can survive crossing the black hole horizon in this case."}
