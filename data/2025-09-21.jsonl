To extend beyond natural\nsynthesis, the design of functional metamaterials requires the solution of two\ninverse problems, i.e., modulating the spatial distribution of physical\nproperties to achieve target functionalities, and generating geometric\nstructures to realize the desired physical property distribution. Until now,\nrealizing special functionalities from metamaterials primarily relies on the\nprocess of joining individual 'building blocks' of functional materials, which\nare deliberately designed to attain required responsive behaviors, such as the\nnon-uniform displacement field. However, the discontinuity of the physical\nproperty distribution between the building blocks in the resulted structure,\noften leads to problems such as excessive stress concentration in the joining\nareas and limited design flexibility. To overcome the above problems, we\nproposed a new method for automatic design of functional metamaterials to\nachieve continuity in both geometry and physical properties. The fundamental\ntheory of the method is the incorporation of spherical harmonics to represent\nand modulate the spatial distribution of stiffness, which then serves as a\nnon-uniform distribution function for stochastic generation of anisotropic\nspinodal infills with high continuity. The proposed method have potential wide\napplications for designing functional components with programmed responsive\nbehaviors, such as realizing customized tissue supporting and information\nencoding."}

To support the detectors required for HWO and future\nfar-IR missions, at the required power consumption and detector count, we are\ndeveloping a radiation-tolerant reconfigurable readout system for both imaging\nand energy-resolving single photon KID detector arrays. We leverage an existing\nRFSoC-based system we built for NASA balloons that has a power consumption of\n30 Watts and reads out 2000-4000 detectors (i.e. 7-15 mW/pixel), and move to a\nradiation tolerant Kintex Ultrascale FPGA chip to bring low-power wide\nbandwidth readout to a space-qualified platform for the first time.

It\nreviews astrophysical and cosmological evidence, highlights the Standard\nModel's limitations, and motivates searches for WIMPs, axions, and dark photons\nthrough direct, indirect, and collider-based strategies.\n  The experimental work includes the Micromegas-based TREX-DM experiment for\nlow-mass WIMPs, with studies of argon and neon-based gas mixtures, detector\ndesign, shielding, readout, and background suppression. GEM integration boosted\ngain by up to 45. A UV LED-based internal calibration system was developed for\ncompact, low-background operation, while pressure-dependent gain studies\noptimized future low-background TPCs. The thesis also advances axion and dark\nphoton searches via haloscopes and introduces the DarkQuantum prototype, a\nsuperconducting qubit coupled to microwave cavities for single-photon\ndetection. This system enabled the most stringent exclusion limit on massive\ndark photon interactions at 5.051 GHz, demonstrating the feasibility of\nquantum-enhanced detectors.\n  Overall, the work bridges classical and quantum detection techniques,\nadvancing WIMP searches and pioneering compact quantum sensors for axion and\ndark photon detection, laying the foundation for future high-sensitivity dark\nmatter experiments."}

As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust,\nradiation, stiff matter, and dark energy.

We also introduce a novel\nformulation for calculating the Bayes factor for the F-statistic, enabling a\nquantitative assessment of its performance against standard full\nfrequency-domain (FFD) Bayesian inference. Using the benchmark event GW150914,\nwe demonstrate that the F-statistic method is not only approximately $70\\%$\nfaster than FFD but is also statistically stable across different sampler\nconfigurations, with a log-Bayes factor between runs smaller than $0.1$.\nFurthermore, the F-statistic exhibits superior stability against changes in\nsampler configuration, yielding consistently lower Jensen-Shannon divergence\nvalues between analysis runs. While the F-statistic produces slightly broader\nconstraints on some parameters, we argue this represents a more honest\nuncertainty quantification, particularly in high-dimensional parameter spaces\nwith complex posterior structures.

In this work, we go beyond these limitations by\nconsidering arbitrary $q$-th excited states $|q\\rangle$, aiming to investigate\ntheir role in preserving quantum resources. We analyze the influence of the\nHawking effect on multipartite quantum states in the Schwarzschild spacetime,\nwith particular attention to quantum entanglement and coherence. Our results\nshow that, under the influence of the Hawking effect, increasing the excitation\nnumber $q$ leads to a reduction in quantum entanglement and mutual information,\nwhile enhancing quantum coherence. This indicates that the Hawking effect on\nexcited multipartite states tends to degrade quantum correlations but\nsimultaneously protects quantum coherence in curved spacetime. Therefore, when\nimplementing quantum information protocols in gravitational settings, reducing\nthe excitation number $q$ is favorable for maintaining entanglement, whereas\nincreasing $q$ may be advantageous for tasks that rely on quantum coherence in\nrelativistic quantum information processing."}
