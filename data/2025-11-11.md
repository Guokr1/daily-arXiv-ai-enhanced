### [1] [Fundamental Limits to Phase and Amplitude Estimation in the High-Strehl Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05707)
*Jacob Trzaska,Amit Ashok*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种能够饱和相位和振幅估计基本极限的波前传感器，适用于高斯特列尔比条件下的地基望远镜波前传感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地基望远镜受大气视宁度影响，分辨率受限。补偿这些效应对于实现超大型望远镜的潜力至关重要，这需要精确的波前控制，而波前传感器的精度是主要限制因素。

Method: 使用信息论推导最小可实现的残余误差，采用Holevo Cramer-Rao界作为度量标准。提出了一种能够完美提取和相移望远镜活塞模式的波前传感器。

Result: 提出的波前传感器可以完美提取和相移望远镜的活塞模式，并提供了最优相移的闭式表达式。对于圆形孔径，该实现能够饱和基本极限。

Conclusion: 该波前传感器使用当前可制造的光学元件，易于消色差处理，并且可以轻松修改以适应任意孔径形状。

Abstract: Context: Ground-based telescopes are susceptible to seeing, an atmospheric phenomenon that reduces the resolving power of large observatories to that of a home telescope. Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.
  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.
  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.
  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.

### [2] [A Firefly-inspired Model for Deciphering the Alien](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06139)
*Cameron Brooks,Estelle Janin,Gage Siebert,Cole Mathis,Orit Peleg,Sara Imari Walker*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于萤火虫通信模式的新SETI方法，通过信号结构特征而非复杂内容来识别外星信号，使用脉冲星数据验证了该模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SETI研究过于人类中心主义，忽视了地球上其他智能物种的通信方式。萤火虫等非人类物种的通信模式可能为寻找外星智能提供新思路。

Method: 基于萤火虫通信模式构建模型，利用澳大利亚望远镜国家设施的脉冲星数据生成模拟信号，检测信号与周围天体现象的结构差异。

Result: 模型证明外星信号不需要复杂内容，仅通过其与自然背景的进化优化对比度即可识别，成功在脉冲星数据中检测到具有结构差异的模拟信号。

Conclusion: SETI研究应超越人类中心主义假设，关注通信信号的基本结构特性，借鉴地球生物多样性中的智能形式来扩展探测方法。

Abstract: The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI) is, historically, a search for aliens like us, inspired by human centric ideas of intelligence and technology. However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection. We discuss implications for broadening SETI methodologies, leveraging the diverse forms of intelligence found on Earth.

Abstract: The Sino-French SVOM (Space Variable Objects Monitor) mission is a space-based astronomy mission complemented with ground-based dedicated instrumentation. It aims to explore and study high-energy cosmic phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals. The structure, technical design, implementation, and performance of the FOCS system are also described in detail. We conclude with a summary of the current status of the FOCS system and our near-future development plan.

Conclusion: AstroPix探测器技术成熟，能够满足未来空间高能望远镜和ePIC探测器BIC成像层的性能要求，为伽马射线成像和粒子识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AstroPix is a high-voltage CMOS (HV-CMOS) monolithic active pixel sensor originally developed to enable precision gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy in the medium-energy regime (approximately 100 keV-100 MeV) based on the groundwork laid by ATLASpix and MuPix. It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV.
  With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation.
  As part of the ongoing detector R&D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer. This presentation will highlight recent performance test results from these AstroPix detector configurations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用深度学习筛选脉冲星候选体的优化搜索流程，通过减少折叠步骤时间显著加速搜索过程，在真实数据集上达到98.3%的准确率和98.44%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 下一代射电望远镜的脉冲星搜索需要从数百万候选体中高效筛选出最有希望的候选体，这促使了基于人工智能工具的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法可提高SMART调查的处理效率，也适用于未来SKA脉冲星巡天，能够泛化到不同望远镜的数据处理。

Abstract: Pulsar searching with next-generation radio telescopes requires efficiently sifting through millions of candidates generated by search pipelines to identify the most promising ones. This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset. This approach can be used to improve the processing efficiency for the SMART and is also relevant for future SKA pulsar surveys.

Method: 开发了CSST无缝光谱成像系统的仿真框架，分析光谱色散特性和结构设计，评估不同天体目标的检测性能。

Conclusion: 成功开发了CSST无缝光谱设备的仿真框架，为后续数据处理和科学研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST), slated to become China's largest space-based optical telescope in the coming decade, is designed to conduct wide-field sky surveys with high spatial resolution. Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification. Furthermore, the GI spectral band exhibits superior detection efficiency compared to the GV and GU bands, establishing it as the primary observational band for stellar and galactic studies. This work successfully develops a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectroscopic equipment.

Conclusion: GEHONG是一个功能强大的光谱模拟工具，为CSST-IFS望远镜的观测准备和数据分析提供了重要支持。

Abstract: We developed a Python package GEHONG to mock the three-dimensional spectral data cube under the observation of an ideal telescope for the Integral Field Spectrograph of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST-IFS). This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra. That makes GEHONG able to mock various types of targets, including galaxies, AGNs, star clusters, and HII regions.

Motivation: MCI具有大视场和同时三波段观测能力，特别适合观测星系团，为研究星系演化、暗物质和暗能量提供强大工具。需要开发模拟框架来测试数据处理流程并最大化其在星系团研究中的潜力。

Method: 从CosmoDC2目录模拟强透镜星系团，计算引力势并进行光线追踪，推导星系团场内星系的真实位置、形状和光分布。同时整合了星系团内光(ICL)和光谱能量分布(SED)。

Conclusion: 该框架为测试MCI数据管道提供了关键基准，并最大化其在星系团研究中的潜力。

Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), one of the instruments aboard the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST), is designed to simultaneously observe the sky in three filters, covering wavelengths from the near-ultraviolet (NUV) to the near-infrared (NIR). With its large field of view ($7.5^{\prime}\times7.5^{\prime}$), MCI is particularly well-suited for observing galaxy clusters, providing a powerful tool for investigating galaxy evolution, dark matter and dark energy through gravitational lensing. Here we present a comprehensive simulation framework of a strong lensing cluster as observed by MCI, aiming to fully exploit its capabilities in capturing lensing features. The framework simulates a strong lensing cluster from the CosmoDC2 catalog, calculating the gravitational potential and performing ray-tracing to derive the true positions, shapes and light distribution of galaxies within the cluster field. Additionally, the simulation incorporates intra-cluster light (ICL) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), enabling further strong lensing analyses, such as ICL seperation from galaxy light and mass reconstruction combining strong and weak lensing measurements. This framework provides a critical benchmark for testing the MCI data pipeline and maximizing its potential in galaxy cluster research.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive end-to-end simulation analysis of the optical imaging performance of the China Survey Space Telescope (CSST) under in-orbit conditions. An integrated system model incorporating five static and two dynamic error sub-models was established. Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV. The end-to-end simulation approach adopted in this paper provides a theoretical foundation for improving the image quality in large-aperture, off-axis space telescopes.

Abstract: Stray light significantly influences the detection capabilities of astronomical telescopes. The actual stray-light level during observations depends not only on the telescope's inherent stray-light suppression capability but also on its operational orbit conditions. Accurate estimation of stray-light levels is crucial for assessing image quality and performing realistic scientific simulations. To rapidly estimate stray-light levels under realistic, complex operational conditions, we developed an analytical model tailored to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST). Our model simulates stray-light backgrounds generated by off-field sources such as moonlight, starlight, and earthshine, incorporating the effects of zodiacal light, as well as scattering and ghost images induced by bright in-field stars. The proposed method allows quick and accurate evaluation of stray-light conditions, facilitating both image simulation and observational scheduling.

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space-based observatory. Its main survey camera is designed to conduct high spatial resolution near-ultraviolet to near-infrared imaging and low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. To maximize the scientific output of CSST, we have developed a comprehensive, high-fidelity simulation pipeline for reproducing both imaging and spectroscopic observations. This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements. Our pipeline serves as a vital tool for optimizing CSST main survey strategies and ensuring robust cosmological measurements.

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive system analysis for an instrument onboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), designed for high-precision, high-accuracy differential astrometry, with the primary scientific goal to determine the mass of Earth-like planets around the nearest Sun-like stars. The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane. We evaluate the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and propose a way forward reaching TRL 5 level for key technologies by the Mission Consolidation Review in 2029.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种新型微模式气体探测器，使用3D打印技术制造厚GEM作为单一增益元件，简化探测器结构并实现稳定运行

Method: 设计、制造并测试10cm×10cm活性面积的3D打印厚GEM，包含三个不同间隙环尺寸(0.1mm、0.15mm、0.2mm)的区域，在Ar/CO2 70:30气体中测试性能

Result: 0.15mm间隙环区域在稳定运行下达到10^4以上增益，放电率低；气体增益随时间变化，首小时快速上升，随后24小时缓慢下降后稳定

Conclusion: 3D打印厚GEM可作为单一增益元件的气体探测器，0.15mm间隙环设计性能最佳，实现了无需预放大的稳定高增益运行

Abstract: We present the first micropattern gaseous detector that employs a small 3D-printed Thick-GEM as its sole gain element. The detector can achieve sufficient gas gain for regular operation without the need for pre-amplification by additional gain elements. We describe the design, quality control, assembly, and test of this detector. The 10 cm $\times$ 10 cm active area of the Thick-GEM features three separate sectors with different sizes of the clearance rim annuli (0.1 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.2 mm) around the 0.7 mm diameter holes. The gas gain is found to depend strongly on the rim size. When operated in Ar/CO$_2$ 70:30 gas, the sector with 0.15 mm annulus rims reaches a gain above 10$^4$ while operating in a stable manner with an acceptably low discharge rate. The gain reach under stable operation is found to be considerably lower in the other two sectors. The gas gain shows a characteristic time-dependence as it rises quickly in the first hour of operation and then drops slowly over the next 24 hours and subsequently stabilizes.

Conclusion: 识别了一种不依赖于局部曲率的纯扭转机制，通过该机制相干手性电流可以在中微子丰富的环境中影响有效引力行为。

Abstract: We investigate stationary torsional configurations supported by chiral Majorana neutrino currents in linearized gravity. A Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation (with no physical time interpretation) is introduced to drive the metric perturbation toward fixed points sustained by chiral sources while keeping curvature invariants negligible. We show that divergence-free chiral currents can support globally non-trivial torsional holonomy stabilized by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups pi1(S1) and pi3(S3). Toroidal skyrmionic domains emerge when one chirality dominates, whereas a chiral-flip interference sector enables Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions. In the static limit, a Green-function formulation provides a finite-range Yukawa-type response governed by the neutrino coherence length. These results identify a purely torsional mechanism, independent of local curvature, through which coherent chiral currents may influence effective gravitational behavior in neutrino-rich environments.

Motivation: 研究DSR修正对两体狄拉克方程的影响，填补DSR修正两体方程研究的空白，为这一新领域开辟研究途径。

Method: 推导协变两体狄拉克方程，引入DSR修正，得到修正的波动方程。采用一阶近似计算结合能级，应用于类正电子素系统。

Result: DSR修正导致结合能级位移，精细结构常数变为能量依赖参数：α_eff(E)/α ≈ 1 - E/4E_p。在大相对距离处DSR效应尤为显著。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究DSR修正两体方程的工作，模型显示DSR修正会引起结合能级位移，为后续研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This study investigates a modified two-body Dirac equation in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, inspired by Amelino-Camelia's doubly special relativity (DSR). We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant αbehaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \(α_{eff(E)}/α\approx 1 - \frac{E}{4E_p}\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied. This model is the first of its kind, opening new avenues for further research in this area.

*Damien A. Easson*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 量子场论中的迹异常足以在任何具有非零表面重力内视界的稳态时空中强制执行强宇宙监督原理。在二维膨胀子约化模型中，异常诱导的Polyakov项导致内视界附近产生有限的能量-动量张量分量，而仿射框架能量呈指数增长，从而将内视界转化为Tipler-强奇点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子效应如何影响强宇宙监督原理，特别是迹异常在内视界稳定性中的作用，以解决经典广义相对论中可能存在的因果性问题。

Method: 使用二维膨胀子约化四维爱因斯坦-麦克斯韦理论耦合N个共形场，分析迹异常诱导的Polyakov项在内视界附近的行为，计算能量-动量张量的分量。

Result: 发现内视界附近⟨T_vv⟩趋于有限值N/(48π)κ_-²，而仿射框架能量T_kk呈指数增长e^{2κ_-v}，导致潮汐力爆发，将内视界转化为零性的Tipler-强奇点。

Conclusion: 迹异常是恢复强宇宙监督原理的最小量子成分，该机制是局域的、普适的、状态无关的，适用于Kerr/Kerr-Newman、Λ>0和非奇异内部等情形。

Abstract: We show that the trace anomaly of quantum field theory is sufficient to enforce strong cosmic censorship in any stationary spacetime with an inner horizon of nonzero surface gravity. In the two-dimensional dilaton reduction of four-dimensional Einstein--Maxwell theory coupled to $N$ conformal fields, the anomaly-induced Polyakov term yields a finite $\langle T_{vv}\rangle \to \frac{N}{48π}κ_-^2$ near the Cauchy horizon, while the affine-frame energy grows as $T_{kk}\propto e^{2κ_- v}$. The resulting tidal blow-up converts the inner horizon into a null, Tipler--strong singularity. The mechanism is local, universal, and state-independent, and extends to Kerr/Kerr--Newman, $Λ>0$, and nonsingular interiors. Thus, the trace anomaly is the minimal quantum ingredient restoring strong cosmic censorship.

Motivation: 探索引力波探测器能否观测到原初信号中的显式微分同胚破缺效应，这有助于检验广义相对论之外的引力理论。

Result: aLIGO可观测s_{00}≲-0.1的信号，而更灵敏的未来探测器如LISA和DECIGO可探测s_{00}≈-5×10^{-4}和-3×10^{-3}的破缺。大爆炸核合成对相对论自由度ΔN_{eff}的约束与引力波速度的现有界限一致。

Conclusion: 当前和未来的引力波探测器具有探测原初信号中显式微分同胚破缺的潜力，为检验广义相对论之外的引力理论提供了新的观测窗口。

Abstract: We investigate the potential for current and future gravitational-wave detectors to observe imprints of explicit diffeomorphism violation in primordial signals. Starting from a simple model with known effects, we derive the strain amplitude and power spectrum for primordial gravitational waves, both of which are affected by the symmetry breaking. Through this, we directly find predictions for the tensor spectral index and tensor-to-scalar which are different from general relativity. By considering the known sensitivity curves for NANOGrav, SKA, THEIA, $μ$-ARES, ASTROD-GW, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, AION-km, AEDGE, ET, and aLIGO, we place observability limits on the parameters controlling the diffeomorphism violation. For instance, we find that aLIGO could observe signals for \(s_{00} \lesssim -0.1\), while more sensitive future detectors like LISA and DECIGO could probe violations as small as \(s_{00} \approx -5 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(-3 \times 10^{-3}\), respectively. Finally, we consider the existing constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ which is tightly constrained by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, where we find that $ΔN_{\rm eff}$ only weakly depends on the symmetry breaking but places a lower bound on the coefficients which is consistent with available bounds from the speed of gravitational waves.

Motivation: 广义相对论无法自然地解释暗能量而不引入精细调节的宇宙学常数，因此需要探索替代的引力理论框架。

Method: 研究Teleparallel Gravity和Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity的扩展，通过研究静态球对称解来评估这些理论与局部引力约束的一致性。

Result: 一些模型能够复制所需的宇宙学行为，但往往无法满足太阳系观测边界，特别是在预测的爱丁顿参数方面存在偏差。

Conclusion: 需要一种统一的方法来在宇宙学和局部尺度上测试修正引力理论，以确保理论在不同尺度上的一致性。

Abstract: The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe highlighted General Relativity's inability to naturally account for dark energy without invoking a finely tuned cosmological constant. In response, a wide range of alternative paradigms have been proposed. Among these, Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, which depart from the Riemannian framework of General Relativity and instead rely on torsion or non-metricity to describe gravitational interactions, have gained increasing attention in recent years. We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter. Our findings underscore the need for a unified approach that tests modified gravity theories across both cosmological and local scales.

TL;DR: 开发了数值高效框架来评估引力理论参数，并应用于约束Kerr-BR时空中的视界尺度磁场，利用EHT观测数据。该方法实现了近线性计算效率，首次支持从任意稳态黑洞的视界尺度观测中进行统计稳健的参数推断。

Conclusion: 该方法成功约束了黑洞视界尺度磁场，结果支持爱因斯坦引力理论，为任意稳态黑洞的参数推断提供了高效框架。

Abstract: In this Letter, we have developed a numerically efficient framework for evaluating parameters in metric theories of gravity, and applied it to constrain the horizon-scale magnetic field in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) spacetime using the latest EHT observations. The method's adaptive ray-tracing strategy achieves near-linear computational efficiency without loss of numerical accuracy. Owing to this efficiency, the framework enables high precision shadow modeling at minimal computational cost and, for the first time, supports statistically robust inference of black hole parameters from horizon-scale observations for arbitrary stationary black holes. The above framework is applied to the recently obtained Kerr-BR black hole, an exact magnetized and rotating solution to the Einstein field equations. We have evaluated the horizon-scale magnetic fields of M87* and Sgr A*, with the latter showing a field strength of $93.3^{+14.7}_{-23.8}G$, consistent with the equipartition estimate of $71G$ from polarized ALMA observations, thereby supporting Einstein's gravity.

Result: 获得了包含黑洞质量m、电荷e和背景电场E作为自由参数的静态解，在共动参考系中解是静态的。

Conclusion: 带电黑洞在外部电场中的动力学行为与具有相同荷质比的带电测试粒子相似，但存在重要差异。

Abstract: A simple exact solution of the Einstein - Maxwell field equations for charged non-rotating black hole accelerated by an external electric field is presented. The background space-time, described by the well known Bertotti-Robinson solution, contains a spatially homogeneous electric field and possess the topology AdS2 x S2. The black hole mass m, its charge e and the value of the background electric field E are free parameters of the constructed solution. In the "rigid" (non-inertial) reference frame comoving a black hole, this solution is static. The value of acceleration of a black hole due to its interaction with the external electric field is determined by the condition of vanishing of conical singularities on the axis of symmetry. The dynamics of a charged black hole in the external electric field is compared with the behaviour of a charged test particle with the same charge to mass ratio.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文研究了对称远平行引力在修正f(Q)理论中的宇宙学意义，构建了一个指数f(Q)模型，该模型能够平滑偏离广义相对论并容纳早期暴胀和晚期加速膨胀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索超越ΛCDM模型的引力理论，特别是f(Q)引力理论，以更好地理解宇宙加速膨胀现象，并检验其与观测数据的一致性。

Method: 构建指数f(Q)模型f(Q)=Q+η₁Q₀(1-e^{-η₂√(Q/Q₀)})，使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法约束模型参数，结合宇宙计时器、Pantheon和Pantheon+超新星数据集进行分析。

Result: 模型支持晚期加速膨胀场景，与当前宇宙学观测数据吻合良好。重构的哈勃参数和距离模数与ΛCDM模型一致，但在高红移处存在细微差异。能量条件分析显示强能量条件在低红移处被破坏，而主导能量条件和零能量条件得到满足。

Conclusion: 指数f(Q)引力模型是一个可行的替代理论，虽然ΛCDM模型在统计上仍更受青睐，但该模型提供了理论动机明确的可行替代方案来描述宇宙加速膨胀。

Abstract: The current paper reports an investigation of the cosmological implications of symmetric teleparallel gravity within a modified $f(Q)$ theory. We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + η_1 Q_0\left(1 - e^{-η_2 \sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $η_1$, $η_2$, $H_0$, and $Ω_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $μ(z)$ show strong consistency with $Λ$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied. Cosmic age estimates from the model are consistently in agreement with Planck constraints. Our results indicate the viability of exponential $f(Q)$ gravity. A comparative statistical analysis reveals that while $Λ$CDM remains statistically preferred based on AIC and BIC criteria, the exponential $f(Q)$ model yields comparable fits and remains a theoretically motivated and viable alternative for describing cosmic acceleration.

Conclusion: 相互作用模型对ΛCDM模型有中等证据反对，而非相互作用模型只有不确定证据。动力学系统分析揭示了从早期刚性物质主导到晚期加速膨胀的宇宙演化过程，结果与观测一致。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider an interacting scalar field dark energy model with an exponential potential and a dark sector coupling \( Q = 3γHρ_{dm} \), which has been observationally tested using recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 , Unanchored Type Ia Supernovae, and the compressed CMB likelihood. We find that the Interacting model predicts a Hubble constant of $h = 0.659 \pm 0.0063$, deviating from the $Λ$CDM value by approximately $2.93σ$, while the Non-Interacting model shows a $3.78σ$ deviation. The positive coupling parameter (\( γ> 0 \)) further suggests a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $Λ$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results.

Motivation: 虽然已知光滑事件视界是零超曲面且具有半渗透性，但此前未明确证明后者是前者的必然结果。本文旨在建立这一联系并简化数值计算中视界的定位。

Method: 通过数学证明，展示了时间定向零超曲面的因果世界线只能单向穿透的性质，并基于此定义了障碍物和黑洞区域。

Result: 证明了零超曲面的半渗透性是其固有属性，提出了障碍物和黑洞区域的新概念，这些概念自然包含了事件视界和有界黑洞。

Conclusion: 障碍物仅需局部零性和全局分离性两个简单属性定义，有望简化静态和动态视界在数值计算中的定位过程。

Abstract: We prove that if S is a time-oriented null hypersurface of a Lorentzian n-manifold (M, g), the causal world-lines, which intersect transversally S and are time-oriented in a compatible way, cross the hypersurface all in the same direction, the other being forbidden. Even if it is known that a smooth event horizon (in the sense of Penrose, Hawking and Ellis) is a null hypersurface and has the above semi-permeability property, at the best of our knowledge, it was not known so far that the latter is a mere consequence of the former. Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes. Since barriers are defined by two simple properties -- the merely local property of "nullity" combined with the global property of "separating the space-time" -- we expect they may be used to simplify computations for locating static and/or dynamic horizons in numerical computations.

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be distorted by intervening mass distributions while propagating, leading to frequency-dependent modulations that imprint a distinct signature on the observed waveforms. Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.

Motivation: 研究Kerr-Taub-NUT黑洞的观测特征，探索NUT荷（或引力磁单极子）在黑洞中存在的可能性证据。

Method: 采用数值反向光线追踪方法，分析Kerr-Taub-NUT黑洞在薄吸积盘照射下的内阴影、红移特性和强度分布。

Result: 发现增加自旋参数会使临界曲线变形为"D"形，同时缩小和扭曲内阴影。当n=0.3、theta_o=80度时，内阴影出现"鸭舌帽状"新形态，其右下边缘突出超出临界曲线，形成"扩展内阴影"。

Conclusion: 这种与Kerr黑洞预测的偏差可能为未来高精度天文观测提供NUT荷存在的新证据。

Abstract: In this paper, we apply numerical backward ray-tracing to study the observational appearance of Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) black holes illuminated by thin accretion disk flows. We obtained the inner shadow, redshift characteristics, and intensity distribution of thin-disk images of the KTN black hole, as observed by a common observer located at different positions. The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a "D" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel "duck-cap-like" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the "extended inner shadow", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission. Such deviations from Kerr predictions could be tested by future high-precision astronomical observations, potentially offering new evidence for the existence of NUT charge (or the gravitomagnetic monopole) in black holes.

Abstract: In this study, the cosmological implications of nonminimally coupled $f(Q)$ gravity are examined within the metric-affine formalism, in which the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ couples directly to the matter Lagrangian. Within the symmetric teleparallel framework, a representative $f(Q)$ model is constructed, and the corresponding background cosmological equations are derived. The analysis aims to test whether this geometric formulation yields more consistent realizations of nonminimal matter-geometry couplings. A comprehensive statistical MCMC analysis is performed using cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO DR2, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+, DESY5, and Union3 samples. To complement the statistical study, we employ machine learning methods, such as linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest algorithms, to evaluate the predictive performance and robustness of the data. The results indicate that a partial alleviation of the $H_0$ tension can be achieved for a broad range of parameter choices. Nonetheless, $f(Q)$ gravity emerges as a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, motivating further exploration of extended models consistent with all observations.

Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism where a first-order phase transition modulates the decay rate of a massive field. This modulation, even if the scalar field has negligible energy density, subsequently generates an observable stochastic gravitational-wave background. The stochastic nature of bubble nucleation leads to the asynchrony of phase transitions, generating superhorizon-scale density perturbations through spatial variations in the decay rate $Γ$. These perturbations subsequently source second-order gravitational waves with peak amplitudes governed by the phase transition parameter \(β/H_*\) and decay rate $Γ$.
  We apply this mechanism in the reheating scanario where the decay rate of inflaton are modulated by the scalar field that undergoes a first-order phase transition.
  Numerical calculations reveal that the gravitational wave energy spectrum typically reaches \(Ω_{\text{GW}} \sim 10^{-10}\), demonstrating prospects for detection by space-based interferometers like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.
  This work establishes a new approach to probe phase transition processes in the early Universe without requiring significant vacuum energy release.

Conclusion: f(R,T)引力框架下的这些暴胀模型在当前观测限制下具有可行性，为调和暴胀理论与观测数据提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The advent of high-precision cosmological observations has challenged many traditional inflationary models. Data from $Planck$ 2018 along with the BICEP/$Keck$ 2018 result have already ruled out most of the established models by placing tight constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD & CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity. The cosmological observable parameters, viz. scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and running of scalar spectral index $n_{sk}$ are estimated for the three models, and their trajectories are plotted in the $n_s-r$ plane. The model results are evaluated in light of the $Planck$, BICEP/$Keck$, DESI DR2, and ACT DR6 data. We observe that for a certain model parameter space, these potentials are viable within the current observational bounds.

Conclusion: 研究为克尔几何作为合并后黑洞正确描述提供了最强观测支持，未检测到视界尺度偏差。

Abstract: We perform a long-duration Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave data to constrain the near-horizon geometry of black holes formed in binary mergers. Deviations from the Kerr geometry are parameterized by replacing the horizon's absorbing boundary with a reflective surface at a fractional distance epsilon. This modification produces long-lived monochromatic quasinormal modes that can be probed through extended integration times. Building on previous work that set a bound of log10(epsilon) = -23.5 for GW150914, we reproduce and validate those results and extend the analysis to additional events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. By combining posterior samples from multiple detections, we construct a joint posterior yielding a tightened 90 percent upper bound of log10(epsilon) < -27.12, demonstrating the statistical power of population-level inference through cumulative evidence. Finally, analyzing the newly observed high signal-to-noise ratio event GW250114 from the O4b run, we obtain the most stringent single-event constraint to date, log10(epsilon) < -29.58 (90 percent credible region). Our findings provide the strongest observational support to date for the Kerr geometry as the correct description of post-merger black holes, with no detectable horizon-scale deviations.

Abstract: We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} < H <1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.

Result: 当M''S' - S''M' ≠ 0时两种方法等价；中性黑洞弦和带电黑洞弦具有相同的全局拓扑数W = +1；电荷不影响拓扑分类。

Conclusion: 两种缠绕数计算方法在特定条件下等价；电荷不影响黑洞弦的拓扑分类，这可能反映了AdS背景中柱对称黑洞的普遍性质。

Abstract: In this paper, the equivalence between two methods for computing winding numbers is established: the approach of $φ$-mapping topological current and the residue method. The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.

Conclusion: 这些解析表达式实现简单，适用于通过频率域Teukolsky方程计算极端质量比旋近系统的引力波。

Abstract: We derive the approximate analytical solutions of the bound timelike geodesic orbits in the effective-one-body (EOB) frame with extreme-mass ratio limit. The analytical solutions are expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals using Mino time $λ$ as the independent variable. Since Mino time decouples the $r$ and $θ$-motion, we also give explicit expressions for three orbital frequencies $Ω_r, ~Ω_θ, ~Ω_φ$ using the Fourier series expansion. With these analytical expressions at hand, we can perform Fourier expansions in Mino time $λ$ for any function expressed in terms of the coordinates $(r,θ,φ)$. In particular, the observer's time t is decomposed into Mino time $λ$, and the frequency-domain description is constructed from the $λ$-Fourier expansion and the expansion of t. These analytical expressions are quite simple to implement, and can be applicable for calculating gravitational waves (GWs) from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with the frequency-domain Teukolsky equation.

Abstract: The dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in extreme astrophysical environments are effectively modeled by Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE), a framework essential for studying objects like neutron stars and accreting black holes. The inherently nonlinear nature of the FFE equations makes finding exact solutions a challenging task. This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts.

Motivation: 传统f(R,T)或f(R,L_m)理论引入了额外的几何自由度，可能违反局部引力测试。本文旨在构建一个既能改变物质-时空相互作用，又保持与广义相对论在低密度极限一致的修正引力框架。

Method: 在物质拉格朗日量中引入φ(T)加权因子，保持几何部分不变。这相当于对物质部分进行有效重整化，在高密度时发挥作用，在低密度时平滑过渡到广义相对论。

Result: 在参数空间中识别出一个稳健的窗口，能够产生平滑无奇点的宇宙反弹，具有有界密度、在反弹点有限的Ḣ>0，并保持红外极限下ΛCDM的恢复。

Conclusion: 该机制为奇点解析提供了一条自然途径，同时保留了标准宇宙学的经验成功，为宇宙学奇点问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate a modified gravity framework where the geometric Einstein--Hilbert sector remains untouched while the matter Lagrangian is weighted by a nontrivial function $φ(T)$ of the energy--momentum trace. Unlike $f(R,T)$ or $f(R,\mathcal L_m)$ theories, this construction alters how matter curves spacetime without introducing extra geometric degrees of freedom, thereby remaining consistent with local tests of gravity. Physically, the factor $φ(T)\mathcal L_m$ can be interpreted as an effective renormalization of the matter sector, relevant at high densities and smoothly reducing to GR at low densities. Within this setup we identify a robust window in parameter space leading to a smooth and nonsingular cosmological bounce, with bounded density, finite $\dot H>0$ at the bounce, and preservation of the infrared limit where $Λ$CDM is recovered. This mechanism provides a natural route to singularity resolution while retaining the empirical successes of standard cosmology.

Abstract: The exponential $f(R)$ gravity model provides a theoretically well-motivated extension of General Relativity, introducing a modified gravitational dynamics at late times consistent with a dynamical dark energy scenario, while recovering the $Λ$CDM-like regime at high redshifts with a smooth transition. Using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we constrain the parameters of the exponential $f(R)$ model in combination with the total neutrino mass $\sum m_ν$, employing the latest measurements from cosmic chronometers, the DESI DR2 BAO data, the CMB acoustic scale, and the Pantheon+ supernovae compilation, comparing the results with the $Λ$CDM and the $w_0w_a$CDM models. Our results show that the exponential $f(R)$ model remains consistent with current observations while slightly alleviating the Hubble tension and the neutrino mass problem relative to $Λ$CDM, although the constraints on $\sum m_ν$ are tighter than those obtained for the phenomenological $w_0w_a$CDM scenario. These results indicate that the interplay between modified gravity and neutrino physics in the late Universe may offer a viable framework for further investigation of cosmological tensions.

Conclusion: 背景减法在超越纯引力理论时仍然可靠，但在某些特殊物质场情况下需要额外注意。

Abstract: The background subtraction method has long served as a practical tool for computing the Euclidean action and thermodynamic quantities of black holes. While its equivalence to the Iyer-Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer-Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.

Abstract: In this paper, we elucidate the concept of local acoustic metamaterials. These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.
