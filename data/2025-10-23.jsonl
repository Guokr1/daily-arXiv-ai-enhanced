A\nsignificant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid\nvariations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the\narray, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated\nsignal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable\nsensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based\nphase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We\nadopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these\nphase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly\nerratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman\nfiltering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions,\nwhich permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model\nalso removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during\ncalibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs\nat all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance.

This\nis the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators\nsince 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents\nwork within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of\nGeant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity.\nEfforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to\nnuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation\nquenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be\naddressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments.\nFor that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed\nsince 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data\nwith Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies\nin certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations\nhave proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF\nincreases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis\nhas contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a\nmultiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have\nbeen conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual\nmodulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure.\nFinally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused\non background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the\nexperiment's sensitivity."}

In this work, we demonstrate dynamic modulation of dipole's\ndecay rate by exploiting the tunable plexcitonic modes (graphene plasmons and\nQD-excitons) in the strong coupling regime. By integrating a quantum dot inside\na graphene spherical shell and tuning the local optical response of hybrid\nmodes via voltage-bias, we achieve continuous and reversible control over the\ndecay rate, leading to significant enhancement or suppression of dipole\nemission from near- to far-infrared regime. Furthermore, the plexcitonic peaks\nshows much sharper linewidths in contrast to bare graphene plasmons even in the\noff-resonant coupling which indicates higher sensitivity of the systems at\ntuned wavelengths. We demonstrate the phenomenon with the numerical solution of\n3D Maxwell's equations using MNPBEM tool. Our approach demonstrate a versatile\nplatform for programmable emission control and offer a promising pathway for\ndeveloping reconfigurable quantum photonic devices, such as tunable\nsingle-photon sources and ultrafast optical switches."}

We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki\nmodel on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time\ngrowth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus\nconclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant\nphenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective\ncosmological constant encompassed in its definition.

It is based on a high-temporal-resolution (1\nsecond) wind measurements obtained from a transmission line in Slovenia,\nEurope. Wind speed and direction variability are analysed, and two averaging\nmethods, namely vector averaging, where velocity is averaged as vector, and\nhybrid averaging, where speed is averaged as scalar, are employed. DTR\ncalculations are performed on both high-resolution data and averaged data (5\nminute averaging window). It is demonstrated that averaging has a significant\neffect on both Nusselt number and ampacity, and the effect exhibits a strong\nangular dependency on the relative angle of the wind to the line. Therefore,\ntwo limit cases are studied: in the case of parallel wind, averaged data\nunderestimates the ampacity, and there is a significant amount of cases where\nthe underestimation is larger than 10 %. In the case of perpendicular wind, the\ntwo averaging methods affect the results in different ways, but both result in\na substantial amount of cases where ampacity is overestimated, potentially\nleading to unsafe operation. The main takeaway of the study is that averaging\nwind velocity has a significant impact on DTR results, and special emphasis\nshould be given to the averaging method, as different methods affect the\nresults in different ways."}

This wormhole, built in\nthe framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a\njunction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on\neach side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at\ndifferent locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to\nthe observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the\nspace-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered\nthere. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric\nwormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with\neither one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich\nmulti-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong\nreduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new\nrings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the\nsingle-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat\ndistinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight\nthe potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the\nexistence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their\nmulti-ring structure."}

Despite their\npotential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations\n-naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic\nfields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs\nby performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations\nthat differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We\nfind that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared\nto the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast,\nwhen the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin\nto the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the\nexpected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through\nsuperradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed\npredominantly by this process are expected to be stable."}
