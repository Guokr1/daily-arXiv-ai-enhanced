Compared to ultrafast spectroscopies, these techniques have very high structural-information content and competitive time-resolution, but sensitivity to relative changes in electron scattering intensity is orders of magnitude lower. Hybrid pixel counting detectors (HPCDs) are a promising technology for improved sensitivity and signal-to-noise in UED(S) experiments, as they offer near-zero readout noise and dark counts with the possibility of new acquisition modalities (e.g. shot-to-shot normalization) due to their high frame rates. However, it is well known that HPCDs suffer from count losses at high electron fluxes even in CW beam applications. How this translates to ultrashort electron pulse exposures has yet to be determined and is critical to understanding the application of this technology to ultrafast electron scattering experiments. Here we show that count losses are exacerbated significantly in ultrafast (pulsed) experiments and that HPCDs require count rates to be kept below $\\approx 2$ electrons per pixel per pulse. This count-rate limitation presents a severe constraint on electron bunch charge when interrogating single crystal samples. A model for the electron counting uncertainties in HPCDs across the entire relevant range of average count rates is proposed, from which we derive experimental strategies to optimize data quality in UEDS using direct electron detectors. Finally, we suggest ways HPCDs could be better adapted to ultrashort pulsed beam experiments."}

In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity."}

Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation."}

The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems.

To assess whether additional changes might be appropriate, we examine the distribution of the SHIFTA1, SHIFTA2 values derived from the wavecals (the x and y offsets of the spectral image on the detector), we re-visit the wavelength-dependent fading of the lamps, and we perform simulations to estimate the exposure times that would be needed to obtain accurate SHIFTA values. While the current wavecals do appear to yield reasonable SHIFTA, increases in the default exposure times for some of the shortest-wavelength settings would help to ensure reliable wavelength zero points as the lamps continue to fade."}

The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing.

The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small. These results demonstrate that halo-induced modifications of optical and dynamical black hole signatures are strongly controlled by the density profile parameters."}

A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure.

The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity).

This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation."}

While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors."}

This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies."}

In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \\simeq 0.976$ and $r \\simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of β, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1σlevel while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, λ\\sim 0.3-0.5$, and $β\\sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \\simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \\lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $β$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $ξ$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes."}

We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (ρ_c > 10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield Γ> 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases."}

In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable."}

Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--García black hole as the seed."}

Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation."}

(in press)", "summary": "The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal."}
