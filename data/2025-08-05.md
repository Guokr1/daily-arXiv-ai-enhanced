### [1] [Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in regular coordinates with cosmological time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00951)
*Leonardo de Lima,Davi C. Rodrigues*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文研究了Schwarzschild-de Sitter时空中的两种时间依赖坐标系，证明了它们等价且可用于描述SdS时空。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索黑洞与宇宙背景之间的相互作用，扩展现有坐标系的应用。

Method: 从爱因斯坦方程出发，在SdS时空中引入Friedmann-Robertson-Walker坐标，推导出两种时间依赖的坐标系。

Result: 证明两种坐标系等价，并提供了与Kottler坐标和Lake-Israel坐标的显式变换关系。

Conclusion: 这些结果有助于进一步理解黑洞与宇宙背景的相互作用，并为相关研究提供工具。

Abstract: Starting from the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS)
spacetime and imposing Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates at large
distances, we find two coordinate systems with time-dependent metrics that are
smooth across both the black hole and cosmological horizons. These coordinates
require a positive cosmological constant for regularity, and thus they are not
de Sitter extensions of the Kruskal-Szekeres or Israel coordinates. One of the
coordinate systems was only found in 1999 (Abbassi coordinates), and it has led
to conflicting interpretations in the literature, while the other was briefly
commented on and promptly dismissed as unphysical or incompatible with SdS. We
derive that the second solution is equivalent to the first one, and that both
are indeed equivalent descriptions of SdS spacetime. We also derive explicit
coordinate transformations linking these coordinate systems to the Kottler
coordinates and the maximally extended Lake-Israel coordinates. Among other
applications, these results, which extend the largely used cosmological and
local coordinates, should be useful for further developments in understanding
the exact interplay between black holes and the cosmological background, which
has been the focus of a number of recent works.

### [2] [Spherically symmetric solution in quadratic non-metricity gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00958)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文在二次非度量引力中找到了精确的球对称解，证明二次项可充当宇宙常数，并反驳了文献中关于高阶非度量引力无球对称解的说法。此外，带电场方程的解与非带电情况相同。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文献中关于高阶非度量引力无球对称解的争议，并探索二次项在引力中的作用。

Method: 通过解析方法寻找二次非度量引力中的球对称解，并分析带电场方程的特性。

Result: 找到了精确的球对称解，证明二次项可充当宇宙常数，且带电与非带电情况解相同。

Conclusion: 本文结果反驳了现有文献的结论，为高阶非度量引力的研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We explicitly find an exact spherically symmetric solution in quadratic
non-metricity gravity. We show that the quadratic term acts as a cosmological
constant. This solution contradicts all the claims in the literature that there
is no spherically symmetric solution for higher-order non-metricity gravity.
Moreover, we demonstrate that for the charged field equations, the solution can
be identical to the non-charged case. This is because the off-diagonal
components of the field equation do not feel the effect of the charge.

### [3] [Analysis and research on superradiant stability of Kerr-sen Black Hole](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01120)

Motivation: 探究Kerr Sen黑洞的超辐射稳定性和稳态共振，填补相关研究的空白。

Method: 引入变量y，分析扰动频率在特定范围内（由自旋参数和量子数决定）的超辐射行为。

Result: 当扰动频率在特定范围内时，Kerr Sen黑洞表现出超辐射稳定性，与KN黑洞的行为类似。

Conclusion: Kerr Sen黑洞在特定条件下具有超辐射稳定性，扩展了先前对KN黑洞的研究结果。

Abstract: Kerr Sen black holes possess stretchon parameters and hidden conformal
symmetries. The superradiant stability and steady state resonance of such black
holes warrant further investigation and form the primary motivation for this
study. In this work,we introduce an additional variable, referred to as y, to
generalize the findings of the previous study. When the frequency of the
perturbation lies within a specific range namely, above a certain threshold
determined by the spin parameter and below the sum of the azimuthal quantum
number times the angular velocity at the horizon and the product of the charge
with the electric potential at the horizon,the Kerr Sen black hole exhibits
superradiant stability. This behavior is similar to the superradiant
characteristics previously observed in KN black holes.

Conclusion: 结论指出，量子引力修正显著改变了黑洞的几何和热力学性质，为理解量子黑洞提供了新的视角。

Abstract: A novel quantum black hole model is derived by incorporating the Lorentzian
term within the loop quantum cosmology framework of the quantum
Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model features a quantum-corrected metric
tensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution.
Investigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected
black holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the
exponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a
significant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this
term and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the
Lorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS
model and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the
near-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties
with both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the
anti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the
temperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass
diminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a
logarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase
transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the
de Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black
holes, again differing from classical expectations. Similarly to the anti-de
Sitter case, LQG corrections in the de Sitter case also lead to an extra phase
transition in the heat capacity at small radius.

### [6] [A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01378)
*Zhibang Yao,Gen Ye,Alessandra Silvestri*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种空间协变理论框架下的暗能量模型，通过独立控制背景和扰动的系数，实现任意背景演化并避免线性扰动中的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究暗能量的性质及其对宇宙演化的影响，尤其是如何避免理论中的不稳定性和直接分析幻影穿越。

Method: 通过引入时间相关的自由函数，独立控制背景和扰动，并分析标量模式的行为。

Result: 模型在小尺度上标量模式以有限声速传播，但在大尺度下冻结，避免了强耦合问题。

Conclusion: 该模型（Freezing Gravity）在避免不稳定性方面表现出色，为暗能量研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general
model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and
perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients,
and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of
time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary
background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear
perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing
without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this
model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches
infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the
infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling
issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom
becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR
limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model
\emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a
finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole
in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.

### [7] [Gravitational Waves from Simulated Mergers of 2 and 3 Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01414)
*Faisal Alotaibi*

Main category: gr-qc

Motivation: 研究多黑洞碰撞的引力波信号及其数值模拟的可行性。

Method: 采用Brill-Lindquist初始数据和六阶有限差分法，通过BSSN公式演化系统，利用Weyl标量ψ4计算引力波信号。

Result: 三黑洞碰撞的约束违反更高，检测到意外的引力反冲。

Conclusion: 成功模拟双黑洞合并并提取引力波，但三黑洞碰撞的数值误差和反冲现象需进一步研究。

Abstract: In this project, we simulate the collision of two and three black holes using
NRPy+ (`Python-based code generation for numerical relativity and beyond')
module and BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation, and extract
the resulting gravitational waveforms. Using Brill-Lindquist initial data and
sixth-order finite differences, we evolve the system using the BSSN formulation
and compute the gravitational-wave signal via the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$. To
assess numerical error, we plot the Hamiltonian constraint and observe that
constraint violations are significantly higher in the three-black-hole
collision. Unexpected gravitational recoil is also detected, which may
influence waveform extraction and that is left for further investigation.
Despite the limitations in computational resources imposed by the Google Colab,
we successfully model the merger of a binary black hole system, and we were
able to extract the corresponding gravitational waves.

### [8] [Aharonov-Bohm Effects for Electromagnetism and Gravity in Four-Dimensional Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01538)

Conclusion: 研究确立了引力规范结构的量子可观测性，为实验验证提供了理论支持。

Abstract: This paper investigates a geometric framework for the gravitational
Aharonov-Bohm effect in four-dimensional spacetime, demonstrating how spacetime
curvature induces nonlocal quantum phase shifts within field-free regions. By
constructing vector bundles on spacetime manifolds equipped with Levi-Civita
connections, we derive the holonomy transformations for parallel-transported
quantum states. Under the Newtonian approximation, metric decomposition into
Minkowski background plus scalar potential perturbations reveals through the
linearized Einstein field equations that the gravitationally induced phase
shift is mathematically isomorphic to its electromagnetic counterpart. These
results establish the quantum observability of gravitational gauge structures
and provide theoretical support for experimental verification via atom
interferometry.

### [9] [Statistical Entropy Based on the Generalized-Uncertainty-Principle-Induced Effective Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01559)

TL;DR: 论文研究了广义不确定性原理（GUP）框架下黑洞的统计熵，通过构建三种不同的有效度量，证明了黑洞熵满足Bekenstein-Hawking面积定律，并揭示了GUP如何自然消除紫外发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子引力效应对黑洞统计熵的影响，验证广义不确定性原理（GUP）在黑洞热力学中的适用性。

Method: 构建三种GUP诱导的有效度量，利用't Hooft砖墙方法分析其对黑洞熵的影响。

Result: 黑洞统计熵满足Bekenstein-Hawking面积定律，GUP自然消除了紫外发散，无需人工截断。

Conclusion: GUP修正下的面积定律具有普适性和鲁棒性，为量子引力效应与黑洞热力学的相互作用提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the statistical entropy of black holes within the framework of
the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) by employing effective metrics that
incorporate leading-order and all-orders quantum gravitational corrections. We
construct three distinct effective metrics induced by the GUP, which are
derived from GUP-corrected temperature, entropy, and all-orders GUP
corrections, and analyze their impact on black hole entropy using 't Hooft's
brick wall method. Our results show that, despite the differences in the
effective metrics and the corresponding ultraviolet cutoffs, the statistical
entropy consistently satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law when expressed
in terms of an invariant (coordinate-independent) distance near the horizon.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GUP naturally regularizes the ultraviolet
divergence in the density of states, eliminating the need for artificial
cutoffs and yielding finite entropy even when counting quantum states only in
the vicinity of the event horizon. These findings highlight the universality
and robustness of the area law under GUP modifications and provide new insights
into the interplay between quantum gravity effects and black hole
thermodynamics.

### [10] [Wave Function Collapse Triggering Spacetime Dynamics in Semiclassical Gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01573)

Result: 提出了一种连续经典时空模型，支持因果性，并设计了实验验证方案。

Conclusion: 该框架为量子与引力动力学统一提供了新途径，未来实验可验证其预测。

Abstract: We propose a novel semiclassical mechanism to unify quantum mechanics and
general relativity, where wave function collapse in a superposition state
induces a rapid change in the energy-momentum tensor, triggering spacetime
dynamics that propagate at the speed of light. Unlike models assuming
superposed spacetimes, we posit that the superposition yields a single,
continuous classical spacetime driven by the expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor. Upon collapse, the abrupt shift modifies the spacetime
metric via Einstein's field equations, respecting causality. We explore this
for a particle in a spatial superposition, propose detailed experimental
designs with numerical simulations of gravitational perturbations, address
potential theoretical challenges, and discuss implications for existing
quantum-gravity theories. This framework offers a pathway to reconcile quantum
and gravitational dynamics without quantizing spacetime, with testable
signatures in future experiments.

Conclusion: 暴胀过程中可能产生显著的多体纠缠，为相关研究提供了新视角，并讨论了可能的观测特征。

Abstract: We explore novel generation of genuine multipartite entanglement within
gravitational particle production processes during inflationary stages. To this
end, we focus on perturbative production mechanisms, considering a
non-minimally coupled scalar inflaton field with quartic self-coupling
potential and computing probability amplitudes arising from its gravitational
interaction with background perturbations. The corresponding entanglement
amount is quantified using the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, that
provides a \emph{geometric interpretation of particle entanglement, in terms of
the Fubini-Study metric}. We observe that, in the limit of negligible
squeezing, the total amount of entanglement is dominated by the infrared cutoff
scale, in agreement with previous studies analyzing the von Neumann entropy
within bipartite scenarios. We then show that \emph{non-negligible multipartite
entanglement signatures may emerge across inflation, even during the latest
stages of slow-roll}, highlighting their dependence on inflationary momentum
scales. Generalizations to regimes with non-negligible squeezing, cubic
non-Gaussianities, additional spectator fields and possible observational
signatures are also discussed.

Result: 量子修正参数α的增加导致事件视界和静态极限内移，能层区域扩大，能量提取效率显著提高，最大效率为11.64%。

Conclusion: 量子修正对黑洞能量学有显著影响，导致与经典克尔理论的预测明显不同。

Abstract: We explore the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole spacetime
modified by a quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Focusing on particle
splitting within the ergoregion, we analyze the Penrose process and compute the
extraction efficiency \( \eta \) as a function of both the spin parameter \( a
\) and the quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Our results show that
increasing \( \alpha \) induces an inward shift of the event horizon and the
static limit, resulting in a modest expansion of the ergoregion. This geometric
change significantly enhances the energy extraction potential. By numerically
solving the horizon equation, we determine a maximum extraction efficiency of
11.64\%. Additionally, we derive the expression for the irreducible mass,
highlighting its fundamental role in constraining the amount of extractable
rotational energy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that quantum corrections
have a substantial impact on black hole energetics, leading to marked
deviations from predictions based on classical Kerr theory.

Abstract: Stability of circular orbits of the dust particles within a charged rotating
disc of dust with respect to perturbations in the equatorial plane is analyzed.
Within Einstein-Maxwell theory, the charged rotating disc of dust is an
axisymmetric, stationary solution given in terms of a post-Newtonian expansion.
The disc solution is characterized by a rigid rotation around the axis of
symmetry and a constant specific charge $\epsilon$. It is found that for
$\epsilon<1$ all realized dust particle orbits are stable and for $\epsilon=1$
all dust particles are in marginally stable states.

Abstract: The current transit universe model is a precise solution to the equations of
a new type of gravity theory called metric-affine Myrzakulov $f(R,T,Q,T_m)$
[Herko et al. Phys. Dark Univ. 34 (2021) 100886]. We find a hyperbolic solution
and determine the limits on the model's parameters using the latest
observational data. We examine how certain cosmological factors, like the
deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective equation of state parameter
$\omega_{eff}$, dark energy equation of state parameter $\omega_{de}$, and
matter energy density parameter $\Omega$, change over time to help explain the
properties of the observable universe. We establish a hyperbolic solution and
obtain the observational constraints on the model parameters using the latest
observational datasets. We study the evolution of several cosmological
parameters, including the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective equation of
state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{eff}$, dark energy EoS parameter $\omega_{de}$,
to explain the properties of the observable universe. We perform the Om
diagnostic test for the model, and it represents the phantom scenarios of the
model. The behavior of the dark energy EoS parameter $\omega_{de}$ reveals the
quintom-A-type universe characteristics.

great detail. Compared with static spherical black holes in the same theory,
there is one major difference: there are three branches of NUT solutions,
whereas there are only two branches of static spherical black hole solutions.
Compared with neutral NUT solutions in Weyl gravity, where the solutions
intersect with each other, the charged NUT solutions we find are disconnected.

Abstract: According to the Cosmic Censorship conjecture, naked singularities are
thought to be forbidden in nature and must remain hidden by a horizon. In this
work, we present the causal structure of an exact solution to the
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing a wormhole (WH), where the ring
singularity, without even horizon, is untouchable, this is, causally
disconnected from the rest of the universe. We analyze its metric functions in
Papapetrou coordinates to verify metric analyticity in spacetime, construct the
Carter-Penrose diagram, and use Boyer-Linquist coordinates to visualize the
lining of the ring singularity by the throat. We conclude that the ring
singularity in this WH is lined by the throat, similar to how the event horizon
lines the ring singularity in the Kerr-Newman black hole, satisfying the
Wormhole Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. In this work we show that the topology
of the WH is such that the two sides of the throat are separated by the
singularity, but are topologically identified, giving rise to an instantaneous
connection between these two regions.

Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-vacuum field equations of Cotton gravity and
Conformal Killing gravity admit a generalized class of Vaidya-type solutions.
In particular, beyond the standard induced term associated with the matter

purely geometric origin, arising from the unique structure of these theories.
This extended solution generalizes the classical Vaidya spacetime in General

Abstract: The introduction of thermodynamics into gravitational physics began 5 decades
ago with the discovery that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems once
semiclassical quantum effects are taken into account. Notions of temperature,
entropy, work, and phase changes that were introduced into gravitational
physics and originally applied to black holes, were later extended to
cosmological horizons and other settings as well. A major development occurred
15 years ago with the introduction of pressure in the form of a cosmological
constant. By extending the thermodynamic phase space to include this term,
along with its conjugate volume, black holes were found to exhibit a broad
variety of phase transitions that resembled phenomena seen in chemistry labs.
Black hole thermodynamics has become Black Hole Chemistry, which has led to a
wealth of insights into the nature of black holes, introducing concepts such as
Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points into
gravitational physics. I discuss the origins of Black Hole Chemistry and its
basic features covered in an earlier review [1], and then go on to describe
developments in the subject that have taken place since then. Examples include
multicritical behaviour, polymeric transitions, superfluid transitions, scalar
hair, heat engines, NUT-charge, acceleration thermodynamics, the Joule-Thompson
expansion, holography, complexity, central charge criticality, microstructure,
thermodynamic tension, phase dynamics, and thermodynamic topology. This wealth
of new phenomena suggest that we likely still have a lot to learn from Black
Hole Chemistry.

Conclusion: 通过平均理论简化动力学分析，揭示了标量场模型的渐进行为和避免奇点的条件。

Abstract: We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational
Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological
interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the
associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of
the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the
structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a
generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and
matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble
parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of
cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters
that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the
dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as
a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between
the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases,
both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the
suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical
analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that
ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of
singularities.

Result: 结果显示，坍缩物质转变为冻结星的量子隧穿概率为1（忽略可忽略的修正），表明这种转变是必然的。

Conclusion: 结论是冻结星的形成是不可避免的，为黑洞模拟物提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The frozen star is a type of black hole mimicker: An ultracompact object
whose exterior geometry resembles that of a general-relativistic black hole but
differs in its matter composition and in the regularity of its interior
geometry. It is sourced by a spherically symmetric collection of open-string
flux tubes, which posses an extremely anisotropic energy-momentum-stress tensor
with maximally negative radial pressure. The frozen star represents an
effective classical description of the highly quantum, closed-string polymer
model. A key challenge for any model of a black hole mimicker is to explain how
such objects can form from a collapsing body of matter. We started to address
this important problem in a previous article by adapting the Euclidean-action
method of Gibbons and Hawking to show that the transition into a frozen star is
likely. Here, we improve on our previous results by showing that the transition
probability for a collapsing shell of matter to tunnel quantum mechanically
into a frozen star is unity, up to negligible corrections. Our conclusion is
that such a transition is therefore inevitable.

Result: 发现NMC理论允许新的时空解，并影响流体的性质；提出了多种应力-能量张量的定义及其能量条件。

Conclusion: NMC理论为引力研究提供了新的视角，但其复杂性需要进一步研究。

Abstract: In this work we have proposed some spherically symmetric, static spacetimes
in a theory of gravity which permits non-minimal coupling (NMC) between
curvature of spacetime and fluid variables. It is shown that these
non-minimally coupled theories may admit of new class of metric solutions.
Known metric solutions from GR can also be solutions of the non-minimally
coupled theories, for these cases the NMC affects the nature of the fluid which
sources the spacetime. The paper presents multiple ways in which the modified
field equations appearing in non-minimally coupled theories can be solved. The
NMC produces multiple definitions of the stress-energy tensor. The paper
discusses the complexity related to these sources of curvature as, unlike in
minimally coupled general relativity, in the present theory the Ricci curvature
itself can affect the stress-energy tensor of the effective fluid which seeds
spacetime curvature. The various energy conditions related to various forms of
possible stress-energy tensors are presented in the paper.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this work, we examine the influence of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and
$f(R,T)$ gravity on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) around a magnetically
charged black hole. By analyzing the effective potential, specific energy, and
angular momentum of circular orbits, we study how the NED parameter $\alpha$
and the gravitational coupling parameter $\beta$ affect orbital dynamics.
Increasing $\alpha$ leads to systematic deviations from the Reissner Nordstrom
behavior, reflected in shifts in the ISCO radius and orbital frequencies. We
further explore QPO-generating radii using the Relativistic Precession (RP),
Warped Disk (WD), and Epicyclic Resonance (ER2-ER4) models. We further extend
our analysis by performing an MCMC-based parameter estimation using QPO data
from black holes spanning a wide range of mass scales. This approach yields
consistent observational constraints on the model parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates the spin precession of test particles moving in the
equatorial plane of general stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes using the
Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations. The spin precession angles for two cases,
the small-spin case and the spin-orbital plane parallel case, are derived using
different approximations. For the small-spin case, the precession angle of the
spin components in the equatorial plane along circular orbits is found, and
perpendicular component is shown to be a constant of motion. For the
spin-orbital plane parallel case, it is shown that in general the orbital and
spin motions generally do not affect each other, and the spin precession angle
is calculated using the post-Newtonian method to an arbitrarily high order of
the orbital semi-latus rectum p. The precession angles in both cases are
analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively in the Kerr-Newman spacetime to
elucidate their features. For large orbital radii, it is shown that the leading
order of the precession angle series is generally proportional to the spacetime
mass while the Lense-Thirring effect always appears from the subleading order.
These precession results are then applied to various astronomical systems to
determine their spin precession rates. For systems with observational data, our
results show excellent agreement. For systems without observational data, we
predict their spin precession rates at both the leading and Lense-Thirring
effect orders. These predictions indicate that Jupiter's satellites exhibit
exceptionally large geodetic spin precession and their Lense-Thirring effect
may be detectable with current technology.

Conclusion: 该研究为离散广义相对论提供了物理意义明确的完整可观测集，并建议重新表述圈量子引力的自旋网络态空间。

Abstract: We study how the problem of observables is fully resolved for background
independent theories defined on finite graphs. We argue the correct analogue of
coordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind
of permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes
the entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables
can be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local
correlations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background
independent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph
notions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful
complete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a
reformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and
reveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph
isomorphism problem.

TL;DR: 研究了具有单或双光子球的有毛Schwarzschild黑洞（hSBH）的干涉特征，发现其图像中的光子环结构在长基线上产生强且普遍的干涉特征，可用于黑洞参数精确测量和引力理论测试。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机包括：光子环结构在黑洞图像中的干涉特征可用于精确测量黑洞参数和测试引力理论；hSBH描述了标准Schwarzschild黑洞（SBH）因额外源引起的变形，并在某些参数范围内可能具有双光子球。

Method: 采用解析和数值方法，分析了单光子球和双光子球hSBH的干涉特征。

Result: 对于单光子球hSBH，图像复可见度振幅呈现阻尼振荡；双光子球情况下，若内光子球有效势低于外光子球，光子会被引力捕获，复可见度振幅也呈现阻尼振荡；若内势较高，则出现拍频模式。

Conclusion: 复可见度振幅可以编码中心黑洞光子球结构的特征，为黑洞参数测量和引力理论测试提供新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the interferometric signatures of hairy
Schwarzschild black holes (hSBHs) that have either single or double photon
spheres. Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring
structure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric
signatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole
parameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the
deformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional
sources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter
regimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH
with a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image
exhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon
sphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the
outer one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by
gravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our
findings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature
of the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.

Conclusion: 标量非度量性引力理论能够解释宇宙的多阶段演化，包括加速膨胀和减速阶段，为宇宙学模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) universe in the framework of scalar non-metricity theory of gravity. In
the model, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) described by the
scalar field. In the paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the evolution
of the observed universe. We probe the universe with and without an interaction
between DM and the effective energy density including scalar field in the
non-metricity theory that describes the DE. The critical points of the
autonomous system and their stability are determined to understand the
behaviour of the universe. The cosmological models accommodate the late
accelerating phase of the universe for a given set of parameters, a
matter-dominated saddle point is also found to exist which is flowed by a
decelerating phase dominated by stiff fluid like DE. We obtain a new class of
cosmological model accommodating early inflation, matter-dominated era, and a
future decelerating phase followed by late acceleration of the universe.

Abstract: This study presents a new class of static, spherically symmetric traversable
wormhole solutions within the framework of non-minimal Einstein-Yang-Mills
(EYM) gravity, where the Yang-Mills field is purely magnetic and governed by
the SU(2) gauge symmetry. By incorporating a non-zero redshift function and a
direct coupling between the Ricci scalar and the Yang-Mills field strength
tensor, the work examines the influence of the non-minimal coupling constant
$\xi$ and the magnetic charge $Q$ on the wormhole geometry. The analysis
demonstrates that suitable choices of these parameters can satisfy the
flare-out and throat conditions, allowing for physically viable traversable
wormholes without requiring exotic matter. The study further evaluates the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, showing that quantum corrections, which are
modeled through Euler-Heisenberg-type contributions, reduce the total
gravitational mass and may stabilize the structure. The energy conditions are
analyzed, revealing localized violations of the null and weak energy conditions
at the wormhole throat, while the strong energy condition remains satisfied.
Additionally, light deflection in the presence of the wormhole is calculated,
indicating positive deflection angles and confirming the overall attractive
nature of the gravitational field. These findings highlight the role of
non-minimal gauge-gravity couplings in constructing observationally
distinguishable wormhole configurations.

Result: 发现两个条件可分别消除半个自由度，结果与微扰方法一致。

Conclusion: 通过约束条件成功减少自由度，验证了理论的可行性。

Abstract: A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence
of non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is
investigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric
sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking
of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine
the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which
correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic
background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of
which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further
classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also
apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete
example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing
two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on
the perturbative method.

Abstract: In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian
analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and
SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for
H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the
Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel
density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the
cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is
on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical
character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and
the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs
to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB
places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck
collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time
data can be successfully matched under the same standard.

Abstract: As humanity advances toward long-term lunar presence under NASA's Artemis
program, the development of lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC)
capabilities has become increasingly critical. The high cost of transporting
materials from Earth makes in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) essential, with
lunar regolith serving as a promising local feedstock. Additive manufacturing
(AM) offers a compelling platform for LBMC due to its geometric flexibility,
material efficiency, and capacity for on-demand, site-specific production. This
study investigates material extrusion (MEX) AM of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK)
composites containing 10 to 50 wt% lunar regolith simulant (LRS). PEEK and
LMS-1D powders were melt-compounded via twin-screw extrusion, printed using a
high-temperature chamber, and annealed at 300 degrees C. The samples were
characterized through density measurements, thermal analysis, tensile testing,
and microstructural and elemental mapping. All filaments exhibited densities
above 96%, though as-printed porosity increased from less than 1% in neat PEEK
to 7.5% at 50 wt% LRS due to elevated melt viscosity. Regolith incorporation
enhanced crystallinity (17.4 to 20.5%) and elastic modulus (by 6-41%), while
reducing delamination and warping, which improved dimensional accuracy and
print success rates. Tensile strength declined gradually from 107 MPa to 90 MPa
up to 40 wt% LRS, then dropped sharply to approximately 70 MPa at 50 wt%.
Annealing improved density and stiffness for composites containing up to 30 wt%
LRS, with marginal benefit at higher contents. Microstructural and elemental
analyses confirmed a continuous PEEK matrix with uniformly dispersed regolith
particles. This work establishes processing windows and trade-offs for
regolith-rich PEEK composites, supporting ISRU-enabled AM of future lunar
infrastructure.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI techniques for space applications mirror the
success achieved in terrestrial applications. Machine learning, which excels in
data rich environments, is particularly well suited to space-based computer
vision applications, such as space optical attitude sensing. Of these sensors,
digital sun sensors (DSS) are one of the most common and important sensors for
spacecraft attitude determination. The main challenge in using the DSS for
attitude estimation are sensor errors, which limit the overall achievable
estimation accuracy. However, the traditional sun sensor calibration process is
costly, slow, labor-intensive and inefficient. These limitations motivate the
use of AI techniques to enable more accurate and efficient DSS calibration.
  The objective of this work is to develop an end-to-end predictive calibration
methodology for digital sun sensors to solve 2-axis state estimates utilizing a
sparse submanifold convolutional neural network (SSCNN). We find that the
proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic data
with a mean accuracy of 0.005{\deg} for the two sun angle estimates.
Furthermore, the model is highly capable of implicitly learning complex noise
patterns and handling mixed noise types, thereby greatly improving the model
robustness and accuracy to real-world applications. The main contributions of
this work are: (1) the first application (to our knowledge) of a CNN regression
model to the problem of DSS predictive calibration, (2) the introduction of a
fused end-to-end training approach for DSS calibration, (3) the creation of a
publicly available physics-informed synthetic dataset and simulation for DSS
training images, and (4) the evaluation of the performance of the deep learning
approach for various mask configurations.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了使用无人机载校准源测量天籁圆柱天线波束轮廓的方法，解决了大型天线无法在暗室测量的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天籁圆柱天线因体积过大无法在暗室测量波束轮廓，尤其是南北方向的波束轮廓难以确定。

Method: 利用无人机载校准源在远场飞行，结合地面偶极天线测量发射天线波束轮廓，分析自相关信号确定天线波束轮廓。

Result: 在700-800 MHz频段内，初步测量了南北和东西方向的波束轮廓，并通过天文源过境和模拟波束验证了准确性。

Conclusion: 无人机方法为大型天线波束轮廓测量提供了可行方案，结果与天文源和模拟数据一致。

Abstract: The Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array consists of three adjacent cylindrical
reflectors fixed on the ground, each 40 meters long and 15 meters wide, with
the cylinder axis oriented along the North-South (N-S)direction. Dual linear
polarisation feeds are distributed along the focus line, parallel to the
cylinder axis. Measurement of the primary beam profile of these cylindrical
reflectors is difficult, as they are too large to be placed in an anechoic
chamber. While the beam profile along the East-West (E-W) direction can be
measured with the transit observations of bright astronomical radio sources,
the beam profile along the N-S direction remains very uncertain. We present a
preliminary measurement of the beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical antenna
along both the N-S direction and E-W direction in the frequency range of
700-800 MHz, using a calibrator source carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) flying in the far field. The beam profile of the Tianlai cylindrical
antenna is determined from the analysis of the auto-correlation signals from
the the cylinder array correlator, taking into account the emitter antenna beam
profile, itself measured with a dipole antenna on the ground. The accuracy of
the UAV-based determination of the cylinder beam profiles is validated by
comparing the results with the one derived from bright astronomical source
transits, and with simulated beams.

TL;DR: SPAN是一个基于Python的跨平台GUI软件，旨在简化现代光谱分析工作流程，特别适用于未解析星系光谱的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前光谱分析工具分散且需要编程技能，SPAN旨在提供一个统一、用户友好的环境。

Method: SPAN整合了光谱提取、处理和分析工具，包括pPXF算法，支持多平台运行。

Result: SPAN的输出与现有流程和文献研究一致，验证了其科学准确性。

Conclusion: SPAN通过灵活、易用的环境简化了光谱分析，同时保持了科学准确性。

Abstract: The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared
spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly
expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the
software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented
across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual
integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN
(SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface
(GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis
within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a
variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of
unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS
images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction,
continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including
line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population
studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for
full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android,
and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate
SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies. By
offering a flexible, accessible, and well integrated environment, SPAN
simplifies and accelerates the spectral analysis workflow, while maintaining
scientific accuracy.

Abstract: EDGES-3 is the third iteration of the EDGES experiment, designed to measure
the predicted global absorption feature in the radio spectrum produced by
neutral hydrogen gas at cosmic dawn, a critical observation determining when
and how the first stars populated the universe. The EDGES-3 instrument has been
redesigned to include both the analog and digital electronics within the
antenna, allowing for in-situ calibration and removal of the lossy balun found
in EDGES-2. EDGES-3 has been on multiple deployments in the past 4 years; to
Oregon, Devon Island, Adak Island, and is currently installed and taking data
in the outback of Western Australia. This paper provides an accounting of the
challenges inherent in the detection of the global, cosmological 21-cm signal,
the strategies EDGES employs to mitigate each of these challenges, a
description of the instrument, and a report on the Western Australia deployment
along with observational data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是解决液态氙时间投影室中由离子积累引发的持续单电子发射问题，以提高探测器的灵敏度。

Method: 通过分析Malter型发射机制，提出材料和设计策略的改进建议。

Result: 研究发现持续单电子发射与离子积累相关，并提出了缓解措施。

Conclusion: 未来探测器设计中需注意材料和设计选择，以减少背景发射对超低能量阈值实验的影响。

Abstract: Persistent single-electron emission ("hot spots") has been observed in
multiple liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting
long after ionizing events. Although typically discussed in operational terms,
the behavior is consistent with Malter-type emission triggered by ion
accumulation on resistive oxide surfaces. In this note, we discuss such effects
and recommend material choices and design strategies to mitigate them in future
detectors. This mechanism is especially relevant to experiments targeting
ultra-low energy thresholds, where even small background emissions can limit
sensitivity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HPGe探测器在弱放射性废物分析中测量时间过长，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 提出HPGe Compton Net，结合Channel Prompt方法和专门设计的数据库，利用完整响应函数进行特征学习。

Result: 测试数据显示测量时间减少五倍，精度相当；在低计数数据中平均准确率达90%，优于传统方法的83%。

Conclusion: HPGe Compton Net在低水平放射性废物分析中表现出色，未来将优化其实际应用。

Abstract: High Purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors have been golden standard for gamma
spectrometry in Low level radioactive waste (LLW) analysis; however, their
notable shortcoming is prolonged measurement durations for weak radioactive
waste materials. The present study aimed to develop the HPGe Compton Net, a 1D
Physics Guided CNN to accelerate LLW analysis by taking advantage of the entire
response function of a HPGe detector for each radionuclide of interest, in
contrast to the traditional methods that analyze only peak regions of the
response. This acceleration is supported by two core innovative strategies: (a)
Channel Prompt method, a feature enhancement incorporating additional physical
information to guide the model to locate the designated radionuclide; (b) the
specially designed database to achieve effective targeted feature learning. The
performance evaluation carried out for test data set showed a five times
reduction in measurement time compared to a conventional spectral analysis
method while maintaining comparable precision. Compton perturbation tests
confirmed the model's smart adaptive utilization of the Compton regions. The
generalization testing of four LLW samples as the external validation set
proved its superior performance in low count data with an average accuracy of
90% over 83% of the traditional method. Future work will focus on upgrading the
HPGe Compton Net for practical applications.

Abstract: Cryogenic calorimeters for low-mass dark matter searches have achieved sub-eV
energy resolutions, driving advances in both low-energy calibration techniques
and our understanding of detector physics. The energy deposition spectrum of
gamma rays scattering off target materials exhibits step-like features, known
as Compton steps, near the binding energies of atomic electrons. We demonstrate
a successful use of Compton steps for sub-keV calibration of cryogenic silicon
calorimeters, utilizing four SuperCDMS High-Voltage eV-resolution (HVeV)
detectors operated with 0 V bias across the crystal. This new calibration at 0
V is compared with the established high-voltage calibration using optical
photons. The comparison indicates that the detector response at 0 V is about
30% weaker than expected, highlighting challenges in detector response modeling
for low-mass dark matter searches.

Motivation: 评估NOAA SWPC太阳耀斑预测模型的准确性，验证其是否优于低成本基线方法。

Method: 比较SWPC概率预测与多种基线方法（如持续性、气候学、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归）在26年数据中的表现。

Conclusion: 需开发更准确的数据驱动预测模型，并建议定期更新评估标准以比较新方法。

Abstract: The NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) issues the official U.S.
government forecast for M-class and X-class solar flares, yet the skill of
these forecasts has never been comprehensively verified. In this study, we
evaluate the SWPC probabilistic flare forecasts over a 26-year period
(1998-2024), comparing them to several zero-cost and statistical baselines
including persistence, climatology, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. We
find that the SWPC model does not outperform these baselines across key
classification and probabilistic metrics and exhibits severe calibration issues
and high false alarm rates, especially in high-stakes scenarios such as
detecting the first flare after extended quiet periods. These findings
demonstrate the need for more accurate and reliable eruption forecasting models
which we suggest should be based on modern data-driven methods. The findings
also provide a standard against which any proposed eruption prediction system
should be compared. We suggest that space weather forecasters regularly update
and publish analyses like the one demonstrated here to provide up-to-date
standards of accuracy and reliability against which to compare new methods.
