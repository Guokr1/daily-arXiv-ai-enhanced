These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\\lesssim$ M$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim$\\,7\\,M$_\\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\\lesssim R^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}}\\lesssim 24$\\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \\leq$ B$^{\\rm{QGP}}_{\\rm{Star}} \\leq 10^{16}$\\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values."}

Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox."}

Projecting the displacement onto this eigenbasis and integrating out the spatial dependence over the stellar radius reduces the dynamics to tidal-driven oscillators, with couplings set by relativistic inner products and overlap integrals. Matching to the quadrupolar worldline effective action gives a mode-sum response function and analytic dynamical tidal deformabilities from mode frequencies, normalizations, and overlaps."}

The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation. It establishes this platform as a promising candidate for a microwave-mechanical quantum transducer."}

Here, we report the first multiscale mechanical assessment of Diamondiyne-derived architectures by combining quasi-static compression of 3D-printed specimens with reactive molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding atomic-scale models. We generate four geometries (3F, 2F-SY, 4F, and 2F-USY). All structures resulted in lower density in the range of 0.20-0.38 g.cm^-3. Experiments indicate that the symmetric two-sublattice structure (2F-SY) delivers the best performance, reaching a specific yield strength of 5.91 MPa.g^-1cm^-3 and a specific energy absorption of 279 J.g^-1, whereas 2F-USY architecture yielded the lowest values, with 0.77 MPa.g^-1.cm^-3 and 16 J.g^-1. The 4F geometry provided a specific energy absorption of 254 J.g^-1. The structures deformed through geometric collapse and strut buckling, which was due to diagonal shear in 2F-USY and progressive compaction in 2F-SY and 3F. Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed these experimental trends and revealed strong directional anisotropy due to the arrangement of interlocked sublattices, with a stiffness of 24.1 GPa along the z-direction in the case of 4F architecture. Overall, Diamondiyne-derived architectures display geometry-dominated mechanical behavior and serve as a promising platform for lightweight, energy-absorbing metamaterials."}

The CASPER toolflow has been instrumental in the development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based digital instruments for various radio telescopes, enabling for real-time data processing and analysis.

It is known that such an acceleration gives rise to the famous Unruh effect. Interestingly, its Galilean limit already shows the appearance of quantized modes for particles in free space, given by Airy functions. This happens when a wall or boundary condition is moving in an accelerated trajectory in free space and in the presence of a field. Here we show that such a boundary, when viewed as a material obstacle in motion, gives rise to quantized modes for the Klein-Gordon and Maxwell fields, as long as the boundary does not touch the singularity at the Rindler wedge. This corresponds to a quantum-mechanical problem with an anomalous fall-to-the-origin potential $-1/x^2$ supplemented with a Dirichlet condition. We provide further mathematical analysis regarding the completeness of the solutions in terms of Hankel functions $H^{(1)}$ of imaginary index and argument, and clarify the nature of the corresponding Sobolev spaces when the boundary condition disappears for the accelerated observer. A detailed interpretation of the transition amplitudes is given in connection with particle production obtained from a Bogoliubov transformation."}

Despite these achievements, their resolving power has not yet reached the level required to rival modern wavelength-dispersive grating or crystal spectrometers. Here, we introduce a next-generation SQUID-based microcalorimeter concept that exploits the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of a superconductor operated close to its critical temperature. The resulting mutual-inductance-based readout enables in situ tunable signal amplification, while inherently avoiding hysteretic effects that commonly limit superconducting sensors. Experiments with prototype devices demonstrate robust and reproducible operation over a wide temperature range. Based on our measurements and modeling, we project that an energy resolution below 100meV should be achievable with an optimized absorber-sensor combination. This approach therefore represents a promising pathway towards next-generation cryogenic detectors for high-precision X-ray spectroscopy."}

In this study, we demonstrate a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based reservoir computing system with augmented temporal and spatial nonlinearity by utilizing both gate and substrate terminals as inputs. The ferroelectric polarization state in the next time step can additionally be controlled by modifying the electric field distribution in the gate stack of FeFET through a substrate input, enabling more diverse internal states compared with the case where inputs are applied only to the gate. To introduce a nonlinearity in the time domain, we introduce a delay between a gate input and a substrate input, which facilitates efficient nonlinear mixing between the current and past inputs. As a result, both the short-term memory and nonlinearity of the FeFET reservoir computing system are enhanced with an improved capability of feature extraction of complex input time-series. These findings demonstrate that introducing substrate input provides an additional degree of freedom for controlling ferroelectric polarization dynamics, enabling a flexible, energy-efficient, and highly integrable FeFET-based reservoir computing platform suitable for diverse time-series processing applications."}

A compact dual-phase argon TPC instrumented with seven Hamamatsu R8520-506 PMTs is simulated with electron recoils at 41.5 keV (corresponding to the ${}^{83m}\\mathrm{Kr}$ calibration energy), as well as 1.0 keV to probe the low-S2 regime.

There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind.

In contrast to quantum mechanical models, the interaction between the system (Maxwell field) and the environment (gravitational field) is not postulated phenomenologically, but is instead dictated by the underlying action in a post-Minkowskian approximation. This framework extends earlier models for a scalar field and enables a more detailed analysis of the role of dynamical reference fields (clocks) within the relational formalism. We show that, for a suitable choice of geometrical clocks together with a U(1)-Gauss clock, and by employing an appropriate combination of the observable map and its dual, the resulting Dirac observables are given directly by the transverse components of the photon field as well as the symmetric-transverse-traceless degrees of freedom of gravitational waves on the linearised phase space of the coupled system. In addition we also compare different choices of Dirac observables and their dynamics. Upon applying a Fock quantisation to the reduced system, we derive the time convolutionless (TCL) master equation, truncated at second order, and analyse its structural properties. These results provide a foundation for further investigations of the decoherence model, including its renormalisation and a detailed study of its one-particle sector, and are found to be structurally consistent with former master equations for photons derived using ADM variables and a specific gauge fixing."}

This roadmap paper provides a consolidated overview of this highly dynamic and interdisciplinary research field with a focus on the major roadblocks that limit the widespread adoption of IR photonics in large-scale medical diagnostics. Special attention is given to the ambivalence between the molecular-level spectroscopic interpretation and a broader health-state assessment, highlighting the need for a common framework. Additionally, the paper discusses the critical importance of unified measurement standards, calibration protocols, and medical certification processes to ensure the validity of experimental results, reproducibility, and clinical trust, particularly when novel experimental techniques and AI algorithms are involved.

Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability. This work deepens the understanding of photon-orbit structures in alternative theories of gravity and highlights how such effects could be detected through deviations in black hole shadow size or morphology."}

Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors.

We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging."}

Two TPV cell architectures were fabricated on p-type, highly doped (10^17 cm-3) Ge substrates, differing only in rear contact configuration. A standard device with a gold rear contact achieves a peak efficiency of 7.3 % and a power density of 1.77 W/cm2 at an emitter temperature of 1480 C, while a PERC-type device reaches 6.3 % efficiency and 1.22 W/cm2 at 1426 C. The superior performance of the standard device is attributed to lower series resistance, whereas the PERC design exhibits slightly higher efficiency at lower emitter temperatures (4.0 % vs. 3.8 % at 1150 C) due to enhanced rear-surface reflectivity. A detailed TPV model has been developed and validated across both device architectures. The model identifies out-of-band optical losses as the dominant efficiency-limiting mechanism, primarily caused by strong free-carrier absorption in the highly doped Ge substrate. Using this model, we predict device performance under idealized spectral conditions commonly assumed in prior literature. For a simulated AlN/W spectrally selective emitter, efficiencies as high as 22.3 % at 1800 C are obtained, consistent with previous semi-empirical predictions. In contrast, when previously reported Ge devices are modeled under the realistic graphite emitter spectrum used here, projected efficiencies decrease to as low as 8.1 % at 1480 C. These results show that earlier projections remain valid but idealized and underscore the importance of emitter spectral engineering and substrate optimization. Finally, we present the first direct comparison of Ge and InGaAs TPV devices under identical conditions, demonstrating the superior performance of InGaAs while confirming the cost-driven competitiveness of Ge."}

Utilizing this transformation, we study the shadow of this spacetime and the corresponding images from an equatorial thin accretion disk. The presence of the shell gives rise to distinctive features in the observed images. Notably, we observe distinct double photon rings in the images, which can gradually merge into a single ring. Moreover, the shadow boundaries and the photon rings do not exhibit a one-to-one correspondence. The abrupt changes in redshift factor and the truncated photon regions profoundly influence the image, producing distinctive features such as the step-like structures. These features in shell-equipped spacetimes can help evaluate, through future astronomical observations, the applicability of the Israel junction condition and the shell model in real astrophysical systems."}

The cavity response to membrane displacement is predominantly quadratic when the membrane is positioned at the centre of the posts. We characterise this behaviour by driving the membrane piezo electrically at both central and off-centre positions and calibrating the displacement using an independent interferometric measurement. The calibration reveals a linear coupling between the membrane displacement and the applied drive voltage, while the microwave response follows the static displacement dependence. When the membrane is driven at the centre, the system exhibits the highest displacement-to-voltage sensitivity and the largest quadratic output. As the membrane is moved away from the centre, the response gradually transitions from quadratic to linear. There is a difference of ~ 97 $\\%$ in the quadratic coefficient from the central position and a difference of ~ 92 $\\%$ in the linear coefficient from the off-centre position. This controllable crossover between quadratic and linear coupling is a key requirement for sensors capable of resolving energy quantisation.

We examine specifically an approximation to the \"linearly exact\" gradients (aLE) with standard SPH kernel gradients and with linearly reproducing kernels (RPKs) that fulfill the lowest order consistency relations exactly by construction. Most of the explored SPH formulations use shock dissipation (i.e. artificial viscosity and conductivity) with slope-limited reconstruction and parameters that trigger on both shocks and noise. We also compare with a recent particle hydrodynamics formulation that uses both RPKs and Roe's approximate Riemann solver instead of shock dissipation. Not too surprisingly, we find that the shock tests are rather insensitive to the gradient accuracy, but whenever instabilities are involved the gradient accuracy plays a crucial role. The reproducing kernel gradients perform best, but they are closely followed by the much simpler aLE gradients. The Riemann solver approach has some (minor) advantages in the shock tests, but shows some resistance against instability growth and at low resolution the corresponding Kelvin-Helmholtz simulations show substantially slower instability growth than the best shock dissipation approaches. Based on the battery of benchmark tests performed here, we consider a shock dissipation approach with reproducing kernels (our versions $V_3$ and $V_5$) as best, but closely followed by a similar version ($V_2$) that uses the simpler and computationally cheaper aLE gradients."}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin."}

Building on the scaling law $\\mathcal{M} \\propto ε^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \\sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($ε\\gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures."}

There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon.\n  In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage."}

We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging."}

In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement\" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions."}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin."}

We show that different proposals have different implications which may be distinguished. We then test the hypothesis that the UV corrections to the black hole geometry may be responsible for the current phase of accelerated expansion. To this aim we constrain the value of the regular black hole UV cutoff parameter from observations.

Submitted to Phys. Rev. D", "summary": "We introduce a new factorized and resummed waveform for circularized, nonspinning, compact binaries that leverages on the solution of the Teukolsky equation once mapped into a confluent Heun equation. The structure of the solution allows one to identify new resummed factors that completely absorb all test-mass logarithms and transcendental numbers via exponentials and $Γ$-functions at any post-Newtonian (PN) order. The corresponding residual relativistic and phase corrections are thus polynomial with rational coefficients, that are in fact PN-truncated hypergeometric functions. Our approach complements the recent proposal of Ivanov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135 (2025) 14, 141401], notably recovering the corresponding renormalization group scaling of multipole moments from first principles and fixing the scaling constant. In the test mass limit, our approach (pushed up to 10PN) yields waveforms and fluxes that are globally more accurate than those obtained using the standard factorized approach of Damour et al. [Phys. Rev. D 79 (2009), 064004]. The method generalizes straightforwardly to comparable mass binaries implementing the new concept of universal anomalous dimension of multipole moments and might be eventually useful to improve current state of the art effective-one-body waveform models for coalescing binaries."}

We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries."}

The model naturally resolves the initial singularity resulting in an infinite number of smooth non-singular bounces, while accommodating a phase of accelerated expansion driven by a scalar field rolling at a constant rate. The presence of a timelike extra dimension induces high-energy corrections to the effective Friedmann dynamics, allowing anisotropic shear to be dynamically suppressed near the bounce and rendering the background evolution stable. We derive the full background dynamics analytically and demonstrate that uniform-rate inflation can be consistently embedded within an anisotropic braneworld framework. Primordial scalar and tensor perturbations are analysed using the $δN$ formalism, ensuring that only physically relevant modes exiting the horizon during inflation contribute to observable quantities. Remarkably, we find that observational consistency can be achieved with different levels of anisotropy in the two different scenarios we consider, without compromising the smoothness or stability of the bounce. Our results establish uniform-rate inflation on an anisotropic braneworld as a robust and observationally viable alternative to standard inflationary cosmology, offering a compelling framework in which non-singular early-universe dynamics and precision cosmology can be consistently unified."}
