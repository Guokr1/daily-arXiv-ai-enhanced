In this study, we developed two types of\nscintillator-integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (SCI-IMPs),\none incorporating barium fluoride, and the other bismuth germanate, to enable\nsimultaneous high-precision timing and energy measurements. To evaluate their\nperformance over a wide energy range from keV- to GeV-scale, electron-positron\nannihilation gamma rays and cosmic ray muons were used. For energy\nmeasurements, both detectors achieved an energy resolution of approximately 35%\nat 511 keV. For timing measurements using 511 keV, coincidence time resolutions\n(CTRs) of approximately 50 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) were obtained\nfor both detectors. In contrast, for cosmic ray muon experiments where cosmic\nray muon energy is typically on the order of GeV, CTRs were measured to be 25.1\nand 16.8 ps FWHM for barium fluoride- and bismuth germanate-based detectors,\nrespectively. The versatile scintillator-integration technique established in\nthis study can broaden the applicability of the newly developed SCI-IMPs. In\nparticular, these results demonstrate that the developed detectors push the\nboundaries of timing performance while retaining energy measurement and hold\npromise for future applications in fundamental physics experiments and medical\nimaging."}

Among\nthe different components of straylight, single reflections off the hyperboloid\nsection of the mirror shells often produce arc-like patterns on the detector.\nThese arcs depend not only on the off-axis angle of the source but also on the\ngeometrical alignment of the individual shells. In this paper, we introduce the\nSHell misAlignment Detection for straylight Estimation (SHADE) algorithm, a\nnovel and flexible tool designed to infer the misalignment parameters of\nindividual shells, reproduce the geometry of straylight arcs and predict its\npattern on the detector. SHADE allows us to model each shell displacement with\ntwo parameters: $(\\gamma,\\xi)$ that represents the tilt amplitude and\ndirection. While the algorithm is general and applicable to any Wolter-like\ntelescope, we demonstrate its effectiveness using a set of XMM-Newton\nobservations of the low-mass X-ray binary GX5-1.

With further research, magnonic\nand spintronic circuits can potentially help to fulfill these requirements. We\npresent an experimental proof-of-concept of a hybrid device that can employ\nbroad deteriorated microwave signals to excite and detect low energy\npropagating spin waves (SWs). For this, we use the output signal of a\nspin-transfer torque nano-oscillator (STNO) and connect it to a RF filter based\non a magnonic delay-line. The STNO serves as a tunable nano-scaled signal\ngenerator with a broad output linewidth. Its RF output is fed as input into the\nmagnonic delay-line circuit. Tuning the magnetic field solely at the magnonic\ncircuit, we demonstrate the capability to selectively filter a broad RF input,\nobtaining a spin-wave output signal with a much narrower linewidth. This allows\nto tune the frequency of the RF signal at the output simply by tuning the\nmagnetic field. Our findings are a first step towards a versatile,\nenergy-efficient and compact wave-based filter with high sensitivity. Such a\ndevice can use even low-power, degraded signals and convert them into tunable\nSW outputs, effectively reducing the need for charge-based signal processing."}

A challenging question in such\nmodels is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it\nis well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce,\nwhere $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to\nintroduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes\nnegative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar\nfield will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter\nfields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe\ncan be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects\nthe inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop\nquantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation\nis generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases\nin which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary\npotential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the\ninfluence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in\nthe models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during\nwhich the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem\nis resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the\ninflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an\ninflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological\nproblems existing in the big bang model."}

Very\nimportant: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC),\nwhich is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event\nhorizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at\nthe actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the\ncurvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the\nUniverse encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not\nzero $H^\\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for\n$H^\\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular.

We systematically examine both piecewise\npolytropic and color-flavor-locked equations of state, finding: (1) significant\ncorrelations between both local (central and surface) and global\n(volume-averaged) curvature scalars with $\\bar{I}$ and $\\Lambda$; (2)\nespecially strong correlations between surface and volume-averaged curvature\nscalars and both $\\bar{I}$ and $\\Lambda$; (3) a near\nequation-of-state-independent maximum for the normalized Ricci scalar,\nsuggesting a link to the trace anomaly; and (4) new universal relations\ninvolving normalized central and volume-averaged pressure and energy density,\nwhich also correlate strongly with $\\bar{I}$ and $\\Lambda$. Using constraints\nfrom GW170817 and low-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that $\\Lambda$\nmeasurements directly constrain both scalar curvature quantities and the\ninterior properties of canonical-mass neutron stars. These findings agree with\nthe literature on equation-of-state-dependent Bayesian inference estimates. Our\nidentified relations thus provide an equation-of-state-insensitive connection\nbetween stellar observables, spacetime geometry, and the microphysics of\ncompact stars."}

Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for\nspin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of\nspins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH\nmergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and\nprecessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity\n(NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of\nsource parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular\nprecessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric\nwaveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as\nchirp mass and spin-precession ($\\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric\nBBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that\nfor signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor\ncalculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a\nquasi-circular precessing-spin model.

Moreover, unstable regimes with phantom expansion\n$w_{eff} < -1$ were found for the early dynamics of the model.

The method involves calculating\nthe phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and\nthen applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the\nparameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity.

This yields a closed expression for an\nemergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological\nconstant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum\ncorrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of\nthe phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the\nusual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave\nbackground observables and derivatives of the phase.
