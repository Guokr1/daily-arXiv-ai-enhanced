In this\nwork, a thermal transport model for heterostructures under the non-uniform heat\nsource is developed by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Temperature, heat flux, and spectral thermal conductance\ndistributions are compared between uniform and non-uniform heat sources. The\neffects of heterostructure height, heat source width, and heat source height on\nthermal transfer characteristics are analyzed for four typical\nheterostructures: GaN/AlN, GaN/Diamond, GaN/Si, and GaN/SiC. The results reveal\nthat non-uniform heat sources have little effect on average interfacial thermal\nconductance but induce pronounced local non-uniformity when the heterostructure\nheight is small. The interfacial thermal conductance near the heat source\nregion is significantly higher than that in other areas.

Here, we generalize the study to the scenario\nof a rotating hair black hole within Horndeski gravity and probe the effects of\nthe hairy parameter on the EVPA. For a fixed inclination, the hairy parameter\nenhances the observed EVPA in the slowly rotating case, but decreases it in the\nrapidly rotating case. For a fixed black hole spin, the influence of the hairy\nparameter on the observed EVPA under different observer inclinations is further\nmodulated by the azimuthal angle of the observed polarization vector. The hairy\nparameter's impact is more distinct in the low inclination case as the\nazimuthal angle lies within a specific range, but is almost independent of the\nobserver inclination as the azimuthal angle is beyond this specific range.\nFurthermore, the dependence of the hairy parameter's impact on the EVPA is\nstronger with respect to the black hole spin than to the inclination angle.\nThese results could help to further understand the near-horizon polarized\nimages and Horndeski gravity."}

Following an in-silico design and optimization\nprocess we have developed a galactic cosmic ray (GCR) simulator using a hybrid\nactive-passive methodology.

Moreover, we assume that the early Universe can be\ndescribed with fewer initial symmetries, thus we abandon the isotropy\nassumption and instead explore anisotropic universes, beginning with the\nsimplest one, namely Bianchi I (BI). The presence of small initial fluctuations\nin the early universe can be well described by perturbations around a\nhomogeneous background. GR is a constrained system, and we apply the so-called\nDirac procedure for constrained systems to derive a gauge-invariant Hamiltonian\nformulation suitable for quantization. In this work, we present how this\nprocedure can be extended to a generic background and its relation to the\nKuchar decomposition. Subsequently, we apply this formulation to a BI universe,\nobtaining new and interesting results on the gauge-invariant representation of\nmatter and geometry perturbations. Contrary to the FLRW case, in which all the\nmodes decouple, in BI we see that scalar and tensor modes do not decouple. We\nshow that new types of gauge-fixing conditions exit in this case. For instance,\na gravitational wave can be encoded into scalar modes, by introducing a new\ngauge which is not valid in FLRW. Furthermore, we make a first step towards a\nconsistent and unified quantization of the composite system made of a\nbackground mode and perturbation modes. Specifically, we study tensor modes in\na FLRW universe. We focus on the relation between the choice of internal time\nof the universe and the quantum evolution it undergoes. Our results indicate\nthat the time reparametrization invariance in general relativity affects the\nquantum evolution of the background and perturbation modes. However, in the\nclassical limit, i.e. for a large universe, the dynamics becomes unique. Thus,\nthe predictive power of the theory is maintained."}
