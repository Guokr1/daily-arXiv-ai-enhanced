Focal plane wavefront sensing and control\nallows us to detect, and subsequently remove, time-varying speckles through\nmeasurements of the electric field. Two measurement-based wavefront sensing\napproaches are pairwise probing (PWP) and the self-coherent camera (SCC).\nHowever, the PWP technique is time-consuming, requiring at least 4 images and\nreducing the speed at which aberrations can be eliminated. In the SCC, a\ncoronagraph mask diffracts light outside of the Lyot stop, where it is filtered\nwith a pinhole. The filtered light creates a reference beam, interfering with\nspeckles that leak through the coronagraph. The classic implementation of the\nSCC only works over small spectral bandwidths and needs significantly oversized\noptics which limits its implementation. We propose a new variant, the\nSpatially-Clipped Self-Coherent Camera (SCSCC). The SCSCC utilizes a pinhole\nplaced closer to the Lyot Stop, reducing the overall beam footprint and\nboosting the sensor resolution. A knife-edge beam splitter downstream of the\nLyot Stop splits the light into two channels: fringed and unfringed. This\nallows us to sense the wavefront with a single exposure. Time-varying\naberrations are effectively frozen in place, making them easy to remove. We\npresent monochromatic simulation results of the SCSCC in a sensing and control\nloop, demonstrating a normalized intensity of ~ 4 * 10^-10 in a 5-20 lambda/D\ndark hole.

PS's\nof horizonless compact objects, also belong to the same class with total\ntopological charge $0$, though, one distinction can be made with the black\nholes in massive gravity. While in the former case, the inner PS is stable, in\nthe later case, it is the outer PS which is stable (the inner PS is unstable).\nWe also study the landscape of possible regions of existence of standard and\nexotic photon spheres in the massive gravity parameter space, and correlate it\nwith the horizon structure of the black holes."}

By integrating this trusted kernel with the vectorized blackjax-ns\nframework, we achieve typical speedups of 20-40x for aligned spin binary black\nhole analyses, while recovering posteriors and evidences that are statistically\nidentical to the original CPU implementation. This faithful re-implementation\nof a community-standard algorithm establishes a foundational benchmark for\ngravitational-wave inference. It quantifies the performance gains attributable\nsolely to the architectural shift to GPUs, creating a vital reference against\nwhich future parallel sampling algorithms can be rigorously assessed. This\nallows for a clear distinction between algorithmic innovation and the inherent\nspeedup from hardware. Our work provides a validated community tool for\nperforming GPU-accelerated nested sampling in gravitational-wave data analyses."}

We seek to numerically check the validity of this analytical\napproximation. The Einstein equations in this case are partial differential\nequations for the two unknown metric functions which fully describe the\nspherically symmetric metric. We begin our numerical simulation close to the\nevent horizon with regular initial data specified by a variant of the charged\nVaidya metric.

This work explores the potential of the Taiji-TianQin space-borne\ngravitational-wave (GW) detector network to identify the formation channels of\nmassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at high redshifts ($z \\gtrsim 10$). The\nnetwork substantially improves detection capability, boosting the\nsignal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.2-3.0 (1.06-1.14) relative to TianQin\n(Taiji) alone. It increases the detection rate of MBHBs formed from light seeds\n(LS) by more than 2.2 times and achieves over 96\\% detection efficiency for\nthose originating from heavy seeds (HS). Furthermore, the network enables\ncomponent mass estimation with relative uncertainties as low as $\\sim 10^{-4}$\nat the $2\\sigma$ level. These improvements facilitate the assembly of a\nwell-constrained population sample, allowing robust measurement of the\nfractional contributions from different formation pathways. The network\nachieves high precision in distinguishing between LS and HS origins (7.4\\%\nrelative uncertainty at $2\\sigma$) and offers moderate discrimination between\ndelay and no-delay channels in HS-origin binaries (24\\%). However,\nclassification remains challenging for delay versus no-delay scenarios in\nLS-origin systems (58\\%) due to significant population overlap. In conclusion,\nthe Taiji-TianQin network will serve as a powerful tool for unveiling the\norigins of SMBHs through GW population studies."}
