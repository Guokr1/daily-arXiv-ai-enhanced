Here, we demonstrate memcapacitor structures utilizing a quasi 2-dimensional electron gas, formed at the crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerface, as electrodes and SiO2/SrTiO3 as dielectric layer. The observed memcapacitance originates from the charge localization in a lateral floating gate, while an applied gate voltage enables reversible tuning of the device capacitance. Furthermore, preprogrammed or erased gate biases enable controllable shifts of the capacitance hysteresis window toward positive or negative bias, leading to an enlarged capacitance gap at zero bias. A memcapacitor model developed for this system reproduces the main features of the experimental capacitance hysteresis, capturing the effects of charge fluctuations and dielectric frequency modulation within the oxide layer. The demonstrated low-voltage operation and gate tunability of oxide interface-based memcapacitors highlight their potential for power-efficient, capacitor-based neuromorphic and synaptic electronic architectures."}

Both as-fabricated Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs exhibited forward current density in a range of 130-150 A/cm^2 at 5 V with rectifying ratios >10^10 and a reverse leakage current density at 10^-8 A/cm^2 at -5 V. The differential specific on-resistance of Cr2O3 and NiOx HJDs was 12.01 mΩ*cm^2 and 12.05 mΩ*cm^2, respectively. Breakdown voltages of Cr2O3 HJDs ranged from 1.4-1.9 kV and 1.5-2.3 kV for NiOx HJDs. Theoretical band alignment between Cr2O3 and \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 was calculated from first principles. The ambient exposed NiOx/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs forward current density degraded after 10 days while that of Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs remained nearly unchanged after the same amount of time. It was later confirmed that the ambient exposed sputtered NiOx sheet resistance (Rsh) degradation gave rise to the reduction of the forward current density of the NiOx based HJDs, and water (H2O) was qualitatively determined to be the agent attributed to the forward conduction degradation by measuring the Rsh of NiOx-on-sapphire reference wafer after exposing it to different environments. The Cr2O3/HVPE \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJD also exhibited enhanced thermal stability compared to the NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterostructures at elevated temperatures. Interfacial nickel gallate (Ga2NiO4) phase formation expected from phase diagrams can explain the reduced thermal stability of NiOx/\\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs. This study indicates that Cr2O3 is a stable p-type oxide for the realization of robust multi-kV \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 HJDs."}

However, achieving high-efficiency and scattering-free performance with complex functionalities remains a fundamental challenge. While conventional Generalized Snell's Law (GSL) designs suffer from inherent inefficiencies and parasitic scattering, recent alternatives--including impedance-matching methods and diffraction-grating-based metagratings--have sought to overcome these drawbacks. While efficiency improvement has been demonstrated, both methods are limited in generating complex wavefields such as focusing. Here, we propose a direct wave-shaping (DWS) topology optimization framework that bypasses these intermediate concepts and automates the design of high-performance, monolithic elastic metasurfaces. To mitigate the high computational expense, we parameterize the geometry with movable, deformable and interactable elliptical voids, thereby drastically reducing the design variables while enabling holistic optimization that inherently accounts for nonlocal inter-cell couplings. We demonstrate the framework by designing metasurfaces for challenging tasks including high-efficiency longitudinal-to-transverse wave conversion with large-angle beam steering, wavelength-multiplexed beam steering, and both reflective and transmissive metalenses with numerical apertures exceeding 0.99. Compared to state-of-the-art gradient-index, impedance-based, and hybrid designs, our metasurfaces consistently exhibit superior efficiency, significantly reduced spurious scattering, and enhanced focusing capability, with the most demanding transmissive metalens validated experimentally. This work establishes a scalable and computationally efficient pathway to realizing practical, high-performance elastic metasurfaces for advanced wave manipulation."}

We may group these by increasing complexity as follows. First, smooth variations in brightness across the surface, resembling solar limb darkening but much more prominent and involving more processes in stars with fast spin or external tides. Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.\n  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\\simeq 0.2\\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants. Ongoing projects aims to km-scale synthetic apertures, enough to measure the radius of the nearest white dwarf.

The decay of photocurrent with modulation frequency governs the response time. We find that the maximum modulation frequency is largely determined by the position of light-sensitive junction with respect to the middle of the channel.

We adopt a spherically symmetric background in (3+1) dimensions and consider two types of systems: electrically and magnetically charged. In the first case, we consider the generalized Ellis-Bronnikov model, in which we fix the k-essence field exponent to $n=1/2$ and take the parameter $m\\ge 2$, where $m$ is the parameter that modifies the area of this wormhole model. From this we obtained the expression for the scalar field, the potential, and the associated electromagnetic functions for any values of the parameter $m\\geq{2}$. In the second and third models, we consider the scenario of two wormholes that are structured according to the adjustment of the parameters that define their area function $Σ^2$, and in both cases we adopt $n=1/2$.

This paper advances the hypothesis that a combination of microgravity and ultra-low temperature (near absolute zero) provides an almost \"ideal\" operating environment for quantum hardware. Under such conditions, gravitational perturbations, thermal noise, and vibrational disturbances are minimized, thereby significantly extending qubit coherence times and reducing error rates. We survey four leading qubit platforms - superconducting circuits, trapped ions, ultracold neutral atoms, and photonic qubits - and explain how each can benefit from a weightless, cryogenic setting. Recent experiments support this vision: Bose-Einstein condensates on the International Space Station (ISS) maintained matter-wave coherence far longer than on Earth, atomic clocks in orbit achieved record stability, and a photonic quantum computer deployed in space is demonstrating robust operation. Finally, we outline a proposed side-by-side experiment comparing identical quantum processors on the ground and in microgravity. Such a test would directly measure improvements in qubit coherence (T1, T2), gate fidelity, and readout accuracy when the influence of gravity is removed."}

To image the ionization signals from events in the liquid xenon, the detector will employ metallized fused-silica charge collection tiles instrumented with cryogenic application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), referred to as CRYO ASIC, which are designed to operate directly in LXe to minimize input capacitance and pick-up noise. Here we present the performance of the CRYO ASIC mounted on an auxiliary printed circuit board and evaluated both in a cryogenic environmental chamber and in a dedicated LXe test stand. We demonstrate that the ASICs achieve the desired performance at liquid xenon temperatures, showing a gain stability better than 0.2% over 24-hour operation and reliable in-situ calibration using an on-chip pulser. In the LXe test stand, we show that boiling caused by the chip heat dissipation can be mitigated by operating the system above ~0.1 MPa. The in-LXe noise measured agrees with simulation, which indicates it the $150~e^-$ design requirement can be satisfied. These results establish CRYO ASIC as a viable low-noise in-LXe charge readout solution for nEXO."}

With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation.

These detectors use strong electric fields to collect and multiply positive ions produced by the incident radiation in mm-sized cell holes in dielectric materials, achieving a nm-equivalent spatial resolution of the localization of ionization events, when scaled to liquid water with unit density. Their design assumes that ion impact ionizations of gas molecules within the cell holes dominate signal formation, yet this assumption has lacked direct physical verification. Electron emission from the cell hole walls due to ion impact could also contribute, requiring alternative designs to optimize efficiency.\n  To investigate this, a nanodosimetric detector featuring a single cell hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm in a dielectric plate was developed. Ion collection and multiplication were achieved by applying a negative high voltage to the glass cathode 0.5 mm below the cell hole, assisted by a low drift field above the plate. A grounded readout electrode with a 0.8 mm hole covers the cell hole to prevent interactions of collected ions with the hole walls. High signal yields in 1 mbar and 2 mbar propane gas were observed and indicated that ion impact ionizations of the gas molecules are indeed the primary mechanism for signal induction. The compact nanodosimeter setup was further modeled with Geant4-DNA and Garfield++ for deeper insight.

We demonstrate SERS detection down to clinically relevant 10 ppb via water-mediated trapping in hydroxylated nanoporous silica-coated plasmonic nanogaps, using pentafluoropropylamine (PFP) as a representative synthetic breath biomarker. Uniform nanogaps, with >1000 times electric field enhancement, were generated between a gold film and gold-silica core-shell nanoparticle assemblies using electric field-driven evaporation. Oxygen plasma treatment hydroxylated the silica, enabling water-mediated hydrogen bonding that strengthened PFP adsorption, confirmed by density functional theory.

Furthermore, two CeBr_{3} crystals with different thicknesses are used in order to study how detector efficiency is affected by crystal dimensions. A preliminary analysis of the data is presented."}

Code available at: https://github.com/jwuphysics/automated-mission-classifier", "summary": "Telescope bibliographies record the pulse of astronomy research by capturing publication statistics and citation metrics for telescope facilities. Robust and scalable bibliographies ensure that we can measure the scientific impact of our facilities and archives. However, the growing rate of publications threatens to outpace our ability to manually label astronomical literature. We therefore present the Automated Mission Classifier (amc), a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to identify and categorize telescope references by processing large quantities of paper text. A modified version of amc performs well on the TRACS Kaggle challenge, achieving a macro $F_1$ score of 0.84 on the held-out test set. amc is valuable for other telescopes beyond TRACS; we developed the initial software for identifying papers that featured scientific results by NASA missions. Additionally, we investigate how amc can also be used to interrogate historical datasets and surface potential label errors. Our work demonstrates that LLM-based applications offer powerful and scalable assistance for library sciences."}

They are responsible for providing accurate energy measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The demanding requirements set for next-generation collider experiments impose new challenges on the design of new detectors, and a systematic approach to their optimization is increasingly necessary. The performance of calorimeters is primarily characterized by their energy resolution, parameterized by a stochastic and a constant term, related to sampling fluctuations and non-uniformities respectively. To improve the reconstruction quality of physics objects in the calorimeter, both terms need to be taken into account. Changes in a longitudinally constrained design usually result in a trade-off between these terms, making optimization a non-trivial task. This work focuses on the optimization of a hadronic sampling calorimeter, based on the FCC-ee ALLEGRO detector concept. By controlling the absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation, the impact of the passive to active material proportion on the deposited energy distribution and resolution can be analyzed. Our methodology aims at exploring the design space with practical considerations, paving the way for the development of a closed optimization framework that can evaluate multiple designs against physics performance targets."}

While previous transient searches in CMB data operate in map space, our pipeline directly processes the raw time-ordered data, enabling sensitivity to fast, dynamic signals. We integrate our detection approach into the Simons Observatory time-domain pipeline and assess the performance on simulated observations with injected stellar flare-like light curves. For events flaring with a timescale of 0.5 s, the pipeline detects $\\gtrsim90$% of events at flux densities of 800, 1150, 1650, and 4250 mJy when measured in the 93, 145, 225, and 280 GHz bands respectively. For longer $\\ge5$ second flares, the 90% detection thresholds are reduced by a factor of four. We are able to determine the position of detected events in each observing band, with a positional uncertainty at the detection threshold comparable to the telescope resolution at that band. These results demonstrate the readiness of this pipeline for incorporation into upcoming Simons Observatory data analyses."}

In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character. By using principal fiber bundles, it has been shown that the first law is independent of this gauge choice. The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses."}

Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements. The accessibility of this instrumentation opens new possibilities for localized, high temporal resolution measurements of glacier surface activity at any locations where mass balance stakes are deployed."}

We analyze the response of the relative angular momentum direction to all six polarization modes of gravitational waves and estimate the magnitude of its variation during gravitational wave events. Our findings indicate that when test particles possess magnetic moments, applying an external magnetic field of appropriate strength can induce resonant precession of the angular momentum direction under the influence of gravitational waves. This resonance may significantly amplify the gravitational wave signal, potentially enabling its detection with future gyroscope-based detectors. Such detectors would complement existing gravitational wave observatories that rely on gravitoelectric effects."}

One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon."}

Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the Sáez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated.\n  Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data.\n  Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge."}

This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations."}
