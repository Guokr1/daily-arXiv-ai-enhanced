The growing number of events\nnecessitates prioritized follow-up due to limited multi-wavelength resources,\nrequiring rapid and automated classification. In this study, we introduce\nFrabjous, a deep learning framework for an automated morphology classifier with\nan aim towards enabling the prompt follow-up of anomalous and intriguing FRBs,\nand a comprehensive statistical analysis of FRB morphologies. Deep learning\nmodels require a large training set of each FRB archetype, however, publicly\navailable data lacks sufficient samples for most FRB types. In this paper, we\nbuild a simulation framework for generating realistic examples of FRBs and\ntrain a network based on a combination of simulated and real data, starting\nwith the CHIME/FRB catalog. Applying our framework to the first CHIME/FRB\ncatalog, we achieve an overall classification accuracy of approximately 55%,\nwell over a random multiclass classification rate of 20 % with five balanced\nclasses during training. While this falls short of desirable performance, we\ncritically discuss the limitations of our approach and propose potential\navenues for improvement.

The photon trajectory deviates from the\ncurvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion\nzone around the defect core.

Quadratic gravity generically\nincludes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular\nmomentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical\nfeatures by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to\npropagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the\nquadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including\nmassless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the\nstationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the\nmassless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations\nfrom general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes\ncan be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results\nthat considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the\nparameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by three orders of\nmagnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the\nsensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations."}

The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical\nenvironments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a\nfully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of\nmatter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation\nexpansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a\nmodified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then\nimplement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment\nthrough a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a\nresult, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of\nTeukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of\nthe matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the\nTeukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles.\nAdditionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral,\ncontributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into\nthe global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments.\nFurthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future\ncomputation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model."}
