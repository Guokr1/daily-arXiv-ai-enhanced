### [1] [Fundamental limitations of thermoradiative energy conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19864)
*Maxime Giteau,Michela F. Picardi,Georgia T. Papadakis*

Abstract: Understanding the fundamental limits of various energy conversion approaches
is essential for assessing their efficiency and power output. In this work, we
derive general performance bounds for thermoradiative heat engines that
exchange heat radiatively with a cold sink, establishing
power-versus-efficiency thermodynamic bounds for several configurations. We
find that the performance of these engines is always bounded by that of
radiative engines, which harness the thermal radiation emitted by a hot source,
making thermoradiative engines inherently less favorable for energy conversion.
By unifying the results of radiative and thermoradiative engines within a
common thermodynamic framework, which also encompasses dual-engine
configurations that combine both features, this work provides a comprehensive
understanding of the thermodynamic limits of radiative energy conversion. Our
framework offers general metrics for evaluating specific devices and raises
critical questions regarding the relevance of thermoradiative cells for energy
production.

Conclusion: 需要多尺度设计策略优化下一代有机体异质结太阳能电池性能。

Abstract: The performance of organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is highly
sensitive to both nanomorphology and energetic disorder arising from
microscopic molecular packing and structural defects. However, most models used
to understand these devices are either one-dimensional effective medium
approximations that neglect spatial and energetic disorder or three-dimensional
Monte Carlo simulations that are computationally intensive. In this work, we
present the results from a three-dimensional hybrid model capable of operating
at both high carrier densities and incorporating the effects of energetic
disorder. We first generate realistic morphologies using a phase-field approach
that accounts for solvent evaporation during film formation. Using these
example morphologies, we systematically study the interplay between energetic
disorder and configurational disorder at carrier densities representative of
real device operation. This enables us to separate and visualize the impact of
the nanomorphology and energetic disorder on device performance. Our results
reveal that, even when macroscopic percolation pathways remain intact,
energetic disorder limits performance primarily through suppressed charge
extraction in interconnected domains. This suggest that optimizing molecular
packing at the nanoscale is as critical as controlling phase separation at the
mesoscale, highlighting the need for multiscale design strategies in
next-generation BHJ devices.

### [3] [Device-scale modeling of valley photovoltaics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20054)
*Daixi Xia,Hassan Allami,Jacob J. Krich*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含谷散射效应的泊松/漂移扩散模型，用于模拟谷光伏器件，发现非平衡载流子分布和增加内建电场并不能提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谷光伏是一种新型热载流子太阳能电池，利用大电场下的谷散射效应实现高电压和高效率，但实验器件效率低，需要理论模型解释。

Method: 开发了首个谷光伏器件模型，包含电场依赖的谷散射率，基于蒙特卡洛模拟数据。

Result: 模型显示非平衡载流子分布和增加内建电场无法提高效率。

Conclusion: 谷光伏器件的高效率实现需要其他条件，而非仅依赖非平衡载流子和电场增强。

Abstract: We present a Poisson/drift-diffusion model that includes valley scattering
effects for simulating valley photovoltaic devices. The valley photovoltaic
concept is a novel implementation of a hot-carrier solar cell and leverages the
valley scattering effect under large electric field to potentially achieve high
voltage and high efficiency. Fabricated devices have shown S-shaped
current-voltage curves, low fill factor, and thus low efficiency. We hence
develop the first device model for valley photovoltaics. Our model includes
electric-field-dependent valley scattering rates extracted from previous
ensemble Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the condition of nonequilibrium
carrier populations in the satellite valleys is not enough for valley
photovoltaics to achieve high efficiency. We also show that increasing the
built-in electric field of the valley-scattering region does not improve
efficiency, contrary to previous suggestion.

### [4] [Thermal quench modeling of REBCO racetrack coils under conduction cooling at 30 K for aircraft electric propulsion motors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20178)
*Arif Hussain,Anang Dadhich,Enric Pardo*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 研究高温超导（HTS）跑道线圈在直流电压下的电热响应，揭示高电压导致热失控，低电压呈现周期性振荡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高温超导线圈在航空电机中应用潜力大，但自热问题（如交流损耗或直流短路）可能导致电热失超，影响可靠性。

Method: 结合最小电磁熵产生（MEMEP）方法和有限差分法（FDM），模拟HTS跑道线圈在1V至1000V直流电压下的电热行为。

Result: 高电压下电流超临界值引发热失控；低电压下电流和温度呈现周期性振荡。

Conclusion: 研究为航空用超导电机的热管理和故障响应提供了关键见解。

Abstract: High-temperature superconducting (HTS) racetrack coils are promising
components for lightweight, high-power electric machines due to their
exceptional current-carrying capacity. However, self-heating due to AC loss or
DC short circuits can cause electro-thermal quench, which poses a significant
challenge for the design and reliability of superconducting motors. Here, we
apply an electro-magneto-thermal computational approach that integrates the
Minimum Electro-Magnetic Entropy Production (MEMEP) method for electromagnetic
modelling with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) for electrothermal analyses.
The investigation focuses on the response of an HTS racetrack coil subjected to
DC voltages ranging from low (1 V) to high values (1000 V) at operating
temperature of 30 K. Computations were conducted under two thermal boundary
conditions: complete adiabatic conditions and cooling applied to one side of
the coil with the top surface at 30 K. We found that at higher voltages, the
current exceeds the critical value, causing rapid thermal runaway that damages
the superconducting material. In contrast, at lower voltages, the coil presents
periodic oscillations in current and temperature, demonstrating a complex
interplay of thermal diffusion and electromagnetic stability. This study
provides critical insights into the thermal management and fault response of
HTS coils for aviation applications, particularly in the design of
superconducting motors for electric aircraft.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够高效分析SB波，为通过表面切割设计操控边界层提供了可能，同时考虑了能量流动和趋肤深度的实际应用意义。

Abstract: Much like their counterparts in elastic solids, waves in periodic media can
be broadly classified into Floquet-Bloch body waves, and evanescent surface
waves. Our goal is to elucidate the latter boundary layers, termed surface
Bloch (SB) waves, affiliated with rational surface cuts and homogeneous Neumann
data. To this end we adopt the scalar wave equation with periodic coefficients
as a test bed and develop a unit cell-of-periodicity-based, reduced order model
of the SB waves that is capable of describing both their dispersion, waveforms,
and ``skin depth''. The centerpiece of our analysis is a quadratic eigenvalue
problem (QEP) for the effective unit cell of periodicity -- deriving from a
geometric interplay between the mother Bravais lattice, orientation of the
surface cut, and the direction of SB wave -- that seeks the complex wavenumber
normal to the cut plane given (i) the excitation frequency and (ii) wavenumber
in the direction of the SB wave. In this way the sought boundary layer is
derived via superposition of the evanescent QEP eigenstates, whose strengths
are obtained by imposing the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. With the
QEP eigenspectrum at hand, evaluation of an SB wave -- in terms of both
dispersion characteristics and evanescent waveforms -- entails only a
low-dimensional eigenvalue problem. This feature caters for rapid exploration
of the effect of (periodic) surface undulations, and so enables manipulation of
the SB waves via optimal design of the surface cut. For completeness, our
analysis includes an account for the power flow and ``skin depth'' of a surface
Bloch wave, both of which are critical for the energetic relevance of boundary
layers.

### [6] [A Wide-Input 0.25 um BCD LDO with Dual-Stage Amplifier and Active Ripple Cancellation for High PSRR and Fast Transient Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20522)
*Yi Zhang,Zhuolong Chen,Zhenghao Xu,Yujin He*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种宽输入线性稳压器（LDO），采用双级误差放大器架构和主动纹波消除技术，实现了高PSRR和快速瞬态响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SoC集成度的提高，对同时具备高PSRR和快速瞬态响应的LDO需求增加，但传统架构难以兼顾。

Method: 采用双级误差放大器、主动纹波消除、自适应快速反馈分支和片上频率补偿网络。

Result: 仿真结果显示低频PSRR达-75 dB，负载瞬态响应中输出电压跌落小于0.65 V，恢复时间16 us。

Conclusion: 该设计满足模拟/RF SoC和便携式电子设备的严格要求。

Abstract: Demand for on-chip low-dropout regulators (LDOs) with both high power-supply
rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast transient response is growing as system-on-chip
(SoC) integration increases. However, conventional LDO architectures face
difficulty achieving these performance metrics simultaneously over wide input
voltage ranges. This paper presents a wide-input linear regulator implemented
in 0.25 um BCD technology that attains high PSRR and swift load-transient
performance while maintaining low quiescent current. The proposed LDO employs a
dual-stage error amplifier architecture and active ripple cancellation along
both the power path and the error amplifier's supply to significantly enhance
PSRR across frequency. An adaptive fast feedback branch together with an
on-chip frequency compensation network is introduced to accelerate transient
response without compromising stability. A two-stage PSRR analytical model and
a three-frequency-band PSRR interpretation framework are developed to guide the
design. Cadence Spectre simulations of the 14 V-output LDO demonstrate a -75 dB
low-frequency PSRR, and during a 50 uA - 4 mA load step the output voltage
droop is kept under 0.65 V with recovery within 16 us. These results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and analysis, indicating that
the design meets the stringent requirements of analog/RF SoCs and portable
electronics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市中银杏修剪残渣未被充分利用，研究旨在通过热解技术将其转化为有价值的木炭，促进资源优化和可再生能源利用。

Method: 在400至600摄氏度下进行热解实验，通过多种测试评估木炭的燃料性能，包括吸湿性、热重分析、热值测定等。

Result: 木炭质量产率为27.33%至32.05%，热值提升至34.26 MJ/kg，符合一级或二级标准，但需注意重金属含量。

Conclusion: 银杏修剪残渣热解木炭具有良好燃料性能，为城市废弃物管理和可再生能源提供了可行方案，但需进一步优化重金属处理。

Abstract: Ginkgo biloba trees are widely planted in urban areas of developed countries
for their resilience, longevity and aesthetic appeal. Annual pruning to control
tree size, shape and interference with traffic and pedestrians generates large
volumes of unutilized Ginkgo biomass. This study aimed to valorize these
pruning residues into charcoal by optimizing pyrolysis conditions and
evaluating its fuel properties. The pyrolysis experiment was conducted at 400
to 600 degrees Celsius, after oven drying pretreatment. The mass yield of
charcoal was found to vary from 27.33 to 32.05 percent and the approximate
volume shrinkage was found to be 41.19 to 49.97 percent. The fuel properties of
the charcoals were evaluated using the moisture absorption test, proximate and
ultimate analysis, thermogravimetry, calorimetry and inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectrometry. The calorific value improved from 20.76 to 34.26
MJ per kg with energy yield up to 46.75 percent. Charcoal exhibited superior
thermal stability and better combustion performance. The results revealed
satisfactory properties compared with other biomass, coal and biochar
standards. The product complied with first grade standards at 550 and 600
degrees Celsius and second grade wood charcoal standards at other temperatures.
However, higher concentrations of some heavy metals like Zn indicate the need
for pretreatment and further research on copyrolysis for resource optimization.
This study highlights the dual benefits of waste management and renewable
energy, providing insights for urban planning and policymaking.

Conclusion: 研究为飞秒时间尺度上控制磁性材料中的自旋纹理提供了新机制和框架。

Abstract: Ultrafast optical control of magnetic textures offers new opportunities for
energy-efficient, high-speed spintronic devices. While uniform magnetization
reversal via all-optical switching is well established, the formation dynamics
of non-uniform domain walls (DWs) under ultrafast excitation remain poorly
understood. Here, we use Lorentz ultrafast electron microscopy combined with
transient optical grating excitation to directly image the real-time formation
of DWs in a ferrimagnetic GdFeCo film. We observe a rapid evolution from
disordered spin contrast to ordered DW arrays within 10 ps, including a
transient, strongly asymmetric DW state. In a narrow fluence window,
short-lived DWs form and spontaneously vanish within picoseconds. Multiscale
simulations combining atomistic spin dynamics and micromagnetics reveal a
nonlinear nucleation pathway involving a hybrid transition state where
localized, unstable spin textures coalesce into metastable DWs. This
nonequilibrium mechanism explains the observed asymmetry and spatial ordering,
and establishes a framework for controlling spin textures in magnetic materials
on femtosecond timescales.

Abstract: Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using

Conclusion: 研究为非克尔时空的理论探索提供了具体证据，并展示了奇异运动的引力波现象学，可作为非克尔时空的“烟枪证据”。

Abstract: In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular
motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a
dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission,
(say) under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an
ever increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial
motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off
at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is
expected. We analyse circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes
and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence
of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an
inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion,
and give concrete examples, as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This
analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an
example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of scalar fields governed by
higher-order gravity, with particular emphasis on models inspired by the
Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator--a prototypical fourth-order system known for its
connection to ghost-free formulations. By recasting the field equations into a
slow-fast dynamical system, we analyze phase space evolution across exponential
and power-law coupling regimes. Our approach integrates numerical simulations
and geometric methods to visualize trajectories, stream flows, and asymptotic
behavior under varying potential parameters. The underlying system admits
singular surfaces and non-smooth transitions, revealing intricate dynamical
structures. We examine the stability of de Sitter solutions, the crossing of
the phantom divide, and the emergence of cyclic behavior through multiple-scale
analysis. The inclusion of radiation and dust fluids enables the creation of
realistic cosmological scenarios, including a transient matter-dominated era
and a late-time accelerated expansion. Our results highlight the viability of
Pais-Uhlenbeck scalar models in accounting for inflationary dynamics and dark
energy, offering diagnostic tools for characterizing attractors and bifurcation
phenomena in higher-derivative cosmology.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文研究了极端质量比旋入（EMRI）事件中高度偏心轨道产生的周期性引力波爆发（“peeps”），并评估其对LISA探测器噪声背景的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高度偏心轨道EMRI事件产生的周期性引力波信号（peeps）是否会对LISA探测器的噪声背景产生显著影响，尤其是作为潜在信号混淆源的可能性。

Method: 利用Illustris Project模拟黑洞种群，结合EMRI捕获率估计事件数量，并建模三种不同的引力波背景假设。

Result: 发现peeps可能在LISA噪声背景中产生轻微上升（SNR 0.3-2.4），但在最丰富的情况下，背景信号可能单独可探测（SNR 77）并掩盖其他潜在信号。

Conclusion: peeps作为周期性引力波信号，可能对LISA探测器的噪声背景产生显著影响，需在数据分析中予以考虑。

Abstract: Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass
compact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black
hole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will
subsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral
time of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit,
with a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the
mHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus
on extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave
detectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called "peeps". Peeps are
not likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to
consider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do
generate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To
account for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along
with tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using
the Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation
rate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this
study, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave
background produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two
most likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA
noise floor (SNR $\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the
background generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely
obscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\sim77$).

Method: 扩展了Goon和Penco的方法，考虑了角动量的变化，推导出适用于旋转构型的更普适关系。

Result: 建立了连接任意黑洞背景下热力学量的普适关系框架，且结论不受能量收敛影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为量子引力的基本原理提供了深刻见解。

Abstract: In this study, the methodology proposed by Goon and Penco for investigating
the universality on thermodynamic relations with corrections in de Sitter black
holes is extended. A universal thermodynamic extremality relation, under
consideration of the mass of the spacetime $M$ with various state parameters,
proposed by Goon and Penco is investigated in higher dimensional spacetime, the
established universal conclusions are not impacted by the convergence of energy
from the coexistence region of two horizons to the point $N$ or $C$.
Furthermore, by incorporating the shift of the angular momentum into our
analysis, a more universal relation is derived, specifically applicable to
rotating configurations. Notably, a novel conjecture is formulated that
establishes a universal relationship framework connecting shifted thermodynamic
quantities across arbitrary black hole backgrounds. These findings are expected
to offer profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.

Abstract: This thesis explores the late-time cosmic acceleration within the framework
of $f(R,T)$ gravity, a general relativity modification that incorporates the
Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Motivated by
observational evidence for the universe's accelerated expansion and the
limitations of Einstein's theory in explaining dark energy, we study exact
cosmological solutions using various parametrizations of the deceleration
parameter. The analysis includes isotropic and anisotropic models such as
Bianchi type I universes with string fluid, bulk viscous matter, and magnetized
strange quark matter. Several forms of time-varying deceleration parameters are
employed to understand the dynamical behavior of the universe. We also examine
finite-time singularities like the Big Rip and discuss their occurrence in both
anisotropic and FLRW backgrounds. In addition, the thesis investigates
higher-order curvature corrections and geometric modifications, including
wormhole solutions, within the $f(R,T)$ formalism. Energy conditions are
analyzed to assess the physical plausibility of these models. The overall work
aims to provide a coherent and viable description of the universe's evolution
under modified gravity theories.

Abstract: A new formalism in general relativity with a linear response relation between
perturbed Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor is presented. Basic
concepts are borrowed from statistical physics and theory of stochastic
processes by extending them for a spacetime structure. We show qualitatively
new results of the first applications which lay foundations for a sub-hydro
mesoscopic theory in dense matter relativistic stars. This will enable one to
probe structure and phenomena at intermediate scales in relativistic stars and
exotic fluids that they are made up of. The overall aim is to build foundations
for studying dynamical equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of
astrophysical bodies based on stochastic correlations of perturbations of
spacetime and matter fields. This will add to the present literature on
asteroseismology a new insight in a significant way.It is also expected that
this will lead to direct or indirect observational consequences of meso scale
physics under extreme conditions present in the exotic objects.

*Lorenzo Gavassino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文扩展了Landau的超流性判据，提出了一个更广泛的基于热力学原理的判据，适用于任意多序参量的超流体混合物，并推导了一组不等式作为必要条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是推广Landau的超流性判据，使其适用于更广泛的超流体系统，包括任意温度和无能隙超流体。

Method: 方法是通过热力学判据推导一组不等式，并在广义相对论框架下分析，最后取牛顿极限。

Result: 结果表明这些不等式是超流体混合物长期无摩擦运动的必要条件，同时也是对随机流体动力学波动的稳定性充分条件。

Conclusion: 结论是这些宏观约束条件补充了Landau的原始判据，但仅作为流体描述有效时的必要条件。

Abstract: Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader
principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state
of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general
thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid
mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a
certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These
macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they
hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids.
Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a
frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid
description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability
against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis
within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian
limit.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索无需暗物质（DM）的替代引力模型，验证NFDG对星系旋转曲线的解释能力。

Method: 使用NFDG方法和变量分数维$D(R)$分析星系旋转曲线，并引入质量-维度场方程$D_m(R)$。

Result: NFDG成功再现了观测数据，新方法虽精度稍低，但验证了分数维模型的合理性，并排除了暗物质的存在。

Conclusion: NFDG模型为解释星系动力学提供了可行的替代方案，无需依赖暗物质假设。

Abstract: We resume our analysis of Newtonian Fractional-Dimension Gravity (NFDG), an
alternative gravitational model which does not require the Dark Matter (DM)
paradigm. We add three more galaxies (NGC 6946, NGC 3198, NGC 2841) to the
catalog of those studied with NFDG methods. Once again, NFDG can successfully
reproduce the observed rotation curves by using a variable fractional dimension
$D\left (R\right )$, as was done for nine other galaxies previously studied
with these methods.
  In addition, we introduce a mass-dimension field equation for our model,
which is capable of deriving the fractional mass-dimension $D_{m}\left( R
\right)$ from first principles, as opposed to the previous $D\left (R\right )$
which was obtained simply by matching the experimental rotational velocity data
for each galaxy. While the NFDG predictions computed with this new
$D_{m}\left(R\right)$ dimension are not as accurate as those based on the
original $D\left (R\right )$, they nevertheless confirm the validity of our
fractional-dimension approach. Three previously studied galaxies (NGC 7814, NGC
6503, NGC 3741) were analyzed again with these new methods and their structure
was confirmed to be free from any dark matter components.

Conclusion: LensingFlow为引力透镜分析提供了高效、可扩展的自动化解决方案，并具备未来扩展能力。

Abstract: In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an
automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large
series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for
evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of
this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow
metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses
both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well
as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to
allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing
lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future
pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large
scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow
also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the
schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion
of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority
completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept
demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10
signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow
successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its
automated checks of results from consituent analyses.

Conclusion: 宇宙常数应被视为自然界的基本常数，其源于膜张力的物理本质，未来将基于Q理论等机制进一步研究真空能量的精确抵消。

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that by treating space as a three dimensional
elastic membrane, one can interpret the energy density stored in it as Dark
Energy. In particular, we will model space as an infinitely large fundamental 3
brane and show that its vacuum stress energy tensor has the same mathematical
form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz
invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy
density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a
direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension.
Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should
be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological
discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of
String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism,
which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken
super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a
manner such that the fundamental brane (spatial) tension remains the unique
source of the Cosmological Constant.

Method: 通过爱因斯坦场方程推导修正后的热力学第一定律，分析能量-动量张量的 $T^v_v$ 分量对黑洞质量的依赖。

Result: 修正后的定律表明，黑洞质量不能直接视为内能，导致热力学第一定律需修正。

Conclusion: 动态规则黑洞的热力学第一定律需修正，修正因子源于能量-动量张量对质量的依赖。

Abstract: In this work, we establish the corrected first law of thermodynamics for
dynamical regular black holes on both the event horizon and apparent horizon.
We find that the temperature of dynamical regular black holes derived from the
traditional first law differs from that obtained through other approaches. This
indicates that, similar to static cases, the first law of thermodynamics
requires correction. We then derive the corrected first law of thermodynamics
from the Einstein field equations. Our analysis reveals that the corrected
factor originates from the fact that the $ T^v_v $ component of the
energy-momentum tensor depends on the black hole mass. This dependence implies
that the mass of a regular black hole can no longer be directly identified as
the internal energy, leading to the corrections of the first law of
thermodynamics.

Abstract: In this work, we tested the thermal behavior of a class of regular black hole
solutions defined as generalized black-bounce spacetimes. We introduce several
novel configurations governed by different mass functions and geometric
deformations, illustrated by parameters controlling regularity and horizon
structure. Using the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, we compute the Hawking
temperature associated with each model and analyze its dependence on the
underlying parameters. We find that all proposed geometries are free of
curvature singularities and exhibit positive, well defined quasi-local masses
in the Hernandez Misner Sharp formalism. Also, we demonstrate that these models
may possess multiple horizons, including extremal and asymmetric cases, while
typically violating classical energy conditions in the vicinity of the bounce.
Our results show and illustrate the structure and thermodynamic stability of
these regular solutions.

Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics

significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to
the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment
of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter
constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the
predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational
bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe
physics.

Conclusion: FDM孤子对引力波的透镜效应虽小，但放大区域显著，可能为未来观测提供线索。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the
Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$.
Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational
waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate
its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of
GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very
small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge
$\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently,
this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small
antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background,
even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing
arrays today.

Motivation: 探索复杂标量毛发对黑洞动态阴影的影响，为测试黑洞时空动力学提供理论支持。

Method: 通过分析复杂标量场的时间演化，研究黑洞视界半径、光子球半径和阴影半径的变化规律。

Result: 复杂标量毛发的出现导致阴影半径随时间增加，且与视界半径或光子球半径的变化相关。

Conclusion: 复杂标量毛发显著影响黑洞阴影的动态特性，为黑洞动力学研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We research dynamic shadows of a black hole with a self-interacting massive
complex scalar hair. The complex scalar field $\psi$ evolves with time $t$,
whose magnitude on apparent horizon $|\psi_{h}|$ starts from zero, undergoes a
sharp rise followed by rapid oscillations, and eventually converges to a
constant value. The variation of the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$ is similar
to that of the magnitude $|\psi_{h}|$. The emergence of the complex scalar hair
$\psi$ causes the apparent horizon radius $r_{h}$ to start increasing sharply,
and smoothly approaches a stable value eventually. The shadow radius $R_{sh}$
of the black hole with an accretion disk increases with $t_{o}$ the time at the
observer's position. In the absence of an accretion disk, the shadow radius
$R_{sh}$ is larger and also increases as $t_{o}$ increases. Furthermore, we
slice the dynamical spacetime into spacelike hypersurfaces for all time points
$t$. For the case with an accretion disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar
to that of the apparent horizon $r_{h}$, because the inner edge of the
accretion disk extends to the apparent horizon. In the absence of an accretion
disk, the variation of $R_{sh}$ is similar to that of the photon sphere
$r_{ps}$, because the black hole shadow boundary is determined by the photon
sphere. Since the variation of $r_{ps}$ is induced by $\psi$, it can be stated
that the variation in the size of the shadow is likewise caused by the change
of $\psi$. Regardless of the presence or absence of the accretion disk, the
emergence of the complex scalar hair $\psi$ causes the radius $R_{sh}$ of the
shadow to start changing. Moreover, we investigate the time delay $\Delta t$ of
lights propagating from light sources to observer. These findings not only
enrich the theoretical models of dynamic black hole shadows but also provide a
foundation for testing black hole spacetime dynamics.

Result: 证明了新边界条件下的局部存在性和唯一性，并提供了初始数据平滑性的充要条件。

Conclusion: 新边界条件扩展了现有理论，为渐近Anti-de Sitter空间的研究提供了新工具和示例。

Abstract: This article solves the initial boundary value problem for the vacuum
Einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant in dimension 4, giving
rise to asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces. We introduce a new family of
geometric reflective boundary conditions, which can be regarded as the
homogeneous Robin boundary conditions, involving both the conformal class and
the stress-energy tensor of the timelike conformal boundary. This family
includes as a special case the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition,
consisting of setting the boundary stress-energy tensor to zero. It also
agrees, in a limit case, with the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition,
where one fixes a locally conformally flat conformal class on the boundary,
already covered in Friedrich's pioneering work of 1995.
  The proof of local existence and uniqueness for this family of boundary
conditions relies notably on Friedrich's framework and his extended conformal
Einstein equations. These are rewritten in a tensorial formalism, rather than a
spinorial one, as it facilitates the comparison with the Fefferman-Graham
expansion of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter metrics. Similarly to Friedrich's
proof, our geometric boundary conditions are eventually inferred from
gauge-dependent boundary conditions by means of an auxiliary system on the
conformal boundary.
  In addition, our analysis also comprises new necessary and sufficient
conditions for the unphysical fields associated to the initial data to be
smooth up to the conformal boundary. Finally, the paper contains examples of
asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spaces, with a focus on their conformal boundary
data. This provides valuable insight into the possible shapes of boundary
stress-energy tensors.

Abstract: In this note, it is shown that a nonvanishing spatial curvature can generate
primordial matter in the post-inflation era. This matter does not depend on the
curvature parameter and is described by a stiff equation of state. It can have
the properties of spin matter, consisting of particles with a spin quantum
number (spin) s = 1/2. Such a matter can be plausibly identified with quark
matter at the early stage of the evolution of the universe.

Conclusion: GW231123信号极可能由双黑洞合并产生。

Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional
gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed
to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source
frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~
\textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors,
the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms.
It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we
present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the
gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger,
or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence
for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.

Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black
hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin
measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in
particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the
lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We
disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and
vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a
conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$
years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the
highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic
or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark
photon models with interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the
perspective of free energy landscape. It has been found that for some special
black holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more
surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the
violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for
these black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0
and can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical
exponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is
a symmetry violation in the order parameter.

Abstract: Morphoelasticity represents a foundational theory for tracing back growth,
remodelling, and morphogenesis, yet crucial challenges persist. A unified
growth law -- independent of a priori assumptions about constitutive relations
or specified structures of the growth tensor -- remains in fact elusive, as
does an intimate connection between local anisotropic growth, morphogenesis
dynamics, diffusion phenomena and mechanics. When anisotropy of growth is not
prescribed arbitrarily, current frameworks mainly attribute shape emergence to
growth-induced global configurational switches, somehow neglecting the
existence of local drivers of spontaneous patterning or distorsions also in
stress-free conditions. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose
a theoretical approach that reformulates anisotropic growth, remodeling, and
morphogenesis starting from first principles, grounded in mass balance. In
particular, by positing mass conservation as the sole dynamic constraint for
the growth problem, we generalize the mass balance equation to derive evolution
laws for mass distribution and geometric reconfiguration. This reveals how mass
transport and associated microstructural evolution of the tissue fabric
synergistically guide biological, geometric, and constitutive changes of living
matter, with the isochoric component of growth orchestrating local anisotropy
and, at the macroscale, even spontaneous shape development. The proposed fully
coupled modelling approach integrates chemo-mechanical and biological
interactions inherent to living systems, offering a pathway to investigate
complex scenarios in growth and morphogenesis, redefining the latter in a
Continuum Mechanics framework. It is felt that this strategy could help to take
a step forward a unified perspective for biomechanical and mechanobiological
problems, bridging scales from local drivers to emergent tissue forms and

### [32] [Radiometric Interferometry for Deep Space Navigation using Geostationary Satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19921)
*Moshe Golani,Yoram Rozen,Hector Rotstein*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出一种基于地球静止轨道（GEO）卫星的空间干涉测量方法，用于深空导航，解决了传统地面VLBI系统的基线短、大气干扰和可见性限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深空导航中GNSS信号不可用及地面VLBI系统因基线短、大气干扰和地球旋转导致的限制。

Method: 利用GEO卫星接收并交叉相关航天器信号，实现双频相位角跟踪，并进行误差预算分析。

Result: GEO系统总角度误差约3.73纳弧度，接近地面VLBI性能，几何可用性翻倍且消除大气干扰。

Conclusion: GEO干涉测量方法可行，为未来深空导航提供了新方向，需进一步研究和验证。

Abstract: Deep space navigation presents significant challenges due to the
unavailability of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and severe
signal attenuation over interplanetary distances. Traditional terrestrial
systems, such as NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) and ESA ESTRACK, rely on Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for angular positioning. However, these
systems are limited by relatively short baselines, atmospheric distortions
requiring extensive calibration, and reduced visibility availability due to
Earth rotation. This research proposes a complementary deep space navigation
approach using space based interferometry, in which radio signals from the
spacecraft are received and cross correlated onboard Geostationary Earth Orbit
(GEO) satellites. By replacing terrestrial VLBI stations with dual GEO
platforms, the method significantly extends the effective baseline, removes
atmospheric phase errors, and provides almost continuous visibility to deep
space targets. Unlike Earth based systems, GEO based interferometry maintains
persistent station mutual visibility, enabling higher measurement availability
and more flexible mission support. A complete system model is presented,
including the principles of dual frequency phase based angular tracking and a
structured error budget analysis. Theoretical results show that the GEO based
system achieves a total angular error of approximately 3.73 nanoradians, within
the same order of magnitude as terrestrial VLBI. Space based architecture
nearly doubles the geometrical availability for interferometric tracking, while
eliminating atmospheric distortions. These findings support the feasibility of
the GEO based VLBI concept and motivate continued research and field validation
for future deep space navigation applications.

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）在解决天体物理学中高计算资源需求问题方面展现出潜力，通过四步工作流程（数据编码、量子电路设计、模型训练与评估）实现，数据编码是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习在天体物理学中面临高计算资源需求的问题，量子计算提供了一种可行的替代方案。

Method: 提出四步QML工作流程，重点研究数据编码技术，并以伽马射线暴（GRB）信号检测为例进行验证。

Result: QML在天体物理学中表现有效，数据编码对模型性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: QML为解决高计算资源需求问题提供了新方向，数据编码是其成功的关键因素。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) serves as a general-purpose, highly adaptable, and
versatile framework for investigating complex systems across domains. However,
the resulting computational resource demands, in terms of the number of
parameters and the volume of data required to train ML models, can be high,
often prohibitive. This is the case in astrophysics, where multimedia space
data streams usually have to be analyzed. In this context, quantum computing
emerges as a compelling and promising alternative, offering the potential to
address these challenges in a feasible way. Specifically, a four-step quantum
machine learning (QML) workflow is proposed encompassing data encoding, quantum
circuit design, model training and evaluation. Then, focusing on the data
encoding step, different techniques and models are investigated within a case
study centered on the Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) signal detection in the
astrophysics domain. The results thus obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of
QML in astrophysics, highlighting the critical role of data encoding, which
significantly affects the QML model performance.

Abstract: Crystal Eye is a space-based all-sky monitor optimized for the autonomous
detection and localization of transients in the 10 keV to 30 MeV energy range,
a region where extensive observations and monitoring of various astrophysical
phenomena are required. By focusing on the operating environment and its impact
on the observation process, we optimized the detector design and assessed its
scientific potential. We explored the use of novel techniques to achieve the
science goals of the experiment. We assumed the orbit of a potential future
mission at approximately 550 km altitude near the equatorial region with a
20{\deg} inclination. In such an orbit, the main background contributions for
this kind of detector are from different particles and radiation of cosmic
origin and secondaries produced by their interaction in the Earth's atmospheric
and geomagnetic environment. We studied the response of the detector in this
background environment, using the Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit. We
also calculated other detector performance parameters to estimate its
scientific capabilities. The detector effective area and efficiency are
calculated for low energy gamma-ray sources and used to estimate its
sensitivity to short-duration transient and persistent sources. The calculation
shows a better effective area and sensitivity by several factors compared to
existing instruments of similar type. A method is also developed and discussed
to estimate the online transient-localization performance of the detector,
suggesting a better localization precision by about an order of magnitude than
those typically reported by existing gamma-ray monitors. We present here the
simulation study and results of an innovative detector design concept that can
make a significant contribution in the multi-messenger era. Moreover, this
study can be useful as a technical reference for similar future experiments.

TL;DR: TAPAS在线服务通过先进分子数据库和全球大气模型提供高精度大气透射光谱，支持自定义观测条件，并展示了多项改进和应用实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足高精度大气透射光谱需求，TAPAS服务结合最新数据和模型，提供更广泛波长范围和更多分子种类的光谱预测。

Method: TAPAS基于ECMWF和Arletty数据，利用LBLRTM代码计算透射光谱，并支持HITRAN2020等最新数据库。

Result: TAPAS在近紫外和近红外波长范围扩展，新增NO2等分子，并通过与ESO/VLT/CRIRES实测光谱对比验证其准确性。

Conclusion: TAPAS的改进和扩展使其成为未来近紫外和近红外光谱仪的有力工具，尤其在波长校准和仪器线形测量方面具有潜力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art molecular databases and realistic global atmospheric models
allow to predict accurate atmospheric transmittance spectra. The TAPAS online
service provides atmospheric transmittance spectra of the most important
species as well as Rayleigh extinction, adapted to any observing location,
date, and direction. We describe recent updates, improvements, and additional
tools. TAPAS is interpolating in location in the atmospheric profiles of
temperature, pressure, H$_2$O, O$_2$ and O$_3$ extracted from the ECMWF and
produced by Arletty, a Data Terra/AERIS/ESPRI product, supplemented by
auxiliary climatological models for additional species. The transmittance
spectra are computed with the LBLRTM code. The resolution is chosen to ensure
that the shapes of all absorption lines are reproduced for each species. Major
improvements are: $\bullet$ the extension of the wavelength range in the
near-UV down to 300 nm; in the near-IR up to 3500 nm; $\bullet$ the use of
HITRAN2020; $\bullet$ the addition of NO$_2$, to complement H$_2$O, O$_2$,
O$_3$, N$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$; $\bullet$ an increased accessibility;
$\bullet$ the possibility to force the total H$_2$O column to match the one
measured at the observatory. We show O3 absorption in the near-UV and near-IR
and NO2 absorption in the visible. We illustrate the quality of TAPAS by means
of comparisons between models and ESO/VLT/CRIRES recorded spectra of a hot star
with spectral resolution 130,000, in two intervals with strong H$_2$O, NO$_2$,
CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ absorption. We describe the measurement of an instrumental
Line Spread Function (LSF) based on TAPAS O$_2$ lines and a method using the
Singular Value Decomposition technique that can be made entirely automated.
TAPAS can be used to improve the wavelength and to measure the LSF in regions
where telluric features are present. The extended wavelength range will be
particularly useful for future or recent spectrographs in the near-UV and in
the near-infrared.

Abstract: Direct imaging of cosmic-ray-induced particle showers during daylight is a
long-standing challenge in astroparticle physics. A promising avenue for
capturing images of these showers is through the radio emissions generated by
their electrically charged particles. Their corresponding current vectors
evolve over time as the particle shower propagates through the Earth's
atmosphere leading to a characteristic time-dependent electric field in an
antenna array. In this work, we harness modern Bayesian inference techniques
within the Python toolkit for numerical information field theory NIFTy, coupled
with the high-performance numerical computing capabilities of the Python
library JAX. This innovative combination enables us to reconstruct the particle
shower and its temporal development from data collected by a ground-based
antenna array. Our approach opens an initial pathway for detailed imaging of
cosmic-ray showers, potentially advancing our understanding of high-energy
astrophysical processes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯方法的多变量高斯时间序列频谱估计方法，适用于低频数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对低频数据（如欧洲航天局LISA Pathfinder任务数据），传统方法因观测时间长而无法通过大量周期图平均近似正态分布，需要更精确的估计方法。

Method: 基于周期图和Wishart统计，推导出功率谱密度、相干性及交叉谱密度矩阵的闭式后验分布表达式。

Result: 提供了功率谱密度、相干性、背景噪声谱密度及滤波器传递函数的闭式后验分布。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于低频数据，提供了一种无需大量周期图平均的精确频谱估计途径。

Abstract: We present a Bayesian method for estimating spectral quantities in
multivariate Gaussian time series. The approach, based on periodograms and
Wishart statistics, yields closed-form expressions at any given frequency for
the marginal posterior distributions of the individual power spectral
densities, the pairwise coherence, and the multiple coherence, as well as for
the joint posterior distribution of the full cross-spectral density matrix. In
the context of noise projection - where one series is modeled as a linear
combination of filtered versions of the others, plus a background component -
the method also provides closed-form posteriors for both the susceptibilities,
i.e., the filter transfer functions, and the power spectral density of the
background. Originally developed for the analysis of the data from the European
Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder mission, the method is particularly well-suited
to very-low-frequency data, where long observation times preclude averaging
over large sets of periodograms, which would otherwise allow these to be
treated as approximately normally distributed.

Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) optical satellite communication systems face
performance challenges due to atmospheric effects such as scintillation,
turbulence, wavefront distortion, beam spread, and jitter. This paper presents
a comprehensive mathematical model to characterize these effects and their
impact on signal propagation. We develop a methodology for dynamically
calculating link budgets at any location and time by integrating these models
into a probabilistic framework. The approach accounts for spatial and temporal
variations in atmospheric conditions, enabling accurate estimation of link loss
probabilities. Simulations validate the model's accuracy and applicability to
real-world LEO satellite systems. This work offers a robust tool for optimizing
link performance and enhancing the reliability of satellite networks, providing
valuable insights for system designers and operators.

Abstract: Foundation models are beginning to impact stellar spectroscopy, where spectra
encode rich physical information in a structured, language-like form. A key
challenge is adapting these models across heterogeneous surveys with differing
resolution and coverage. We apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune
SpecCLIP--a contrastively pre-trained model on LAMOST and Gaia XP spectra--for
downstream tasks on DESI Early Data Release (EDR) spectra. We show that LoRA
enables few-shot learning on DESI, with performance varying by fine-tuned
module and benefiting from Gaia XP knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model.
Our results demonstrate that LoRA provides a lightweight and effective strategy
for extending spectral foundation models to new instruments and survey domains.

TL;DR: 研究了在NMX探测器中使用富集Gd（157Gd和155Gd）替代天然Gd的可行性，结果显示157Gd的效率提升至少60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过富集Gd提升NMX探测器中子探测效率的可能性。

Method: 在CERN的nTOF实验中，使用NMX探测器原型，对天然Gd、157Gd和155Gd进行中子飞行时间测量，分析共振区域和热中子能量范围的效率。

Result: 157Gd的效率比天然Gd高60-180%，但1.8 A处的60%提升低于模拟和先前测量的预期。

Conclusion: 富集157Gd可显著提升探测器效率，未来需优化实验条件以减少偏差。

Abstract: The detectors for the NMX instrument at the European Spallation Source (ESS)
in Lund use natural Gd as the neutron converter. In 2024, beam time was
obtained at the neutron time-of flight experiment (nTOF) at CERN to study the
feasibility of an upgrade to enriched Gd. A 10 x 10 cm^2 prototype of the NMX
detector was equipped with two enriched Gd samples (157Gd and 155Gd) that were
attached with copper tape to the natural Gd cathode of the detector. Three sets
of measurements were taken, with the beam focused on either the natural Gd, the
157Gd, or the 155Gd samples. Using the time-of-flight technique with the
subsequent conversion of time-of-flight into energy, the resonant region
between 1 eV and 200 eV of the 157Gd and 155Gd cross sections was studied. The
peaks in the resonant region were clearly visible, having higher ADC values in
the ADC spectrum. Additionally, the resonant peaks had a larger number of
counts per energy bin. In the thermal neutron energy range, the count rate at
the center of the beam was measured for natural Gd, 157Gd, and 155Gd. Enriched
157Gd showed an efficiency that was between 60 - 180% higher, compared to
natural Gd, for neutron wavelengths between 0.8 A and 1.8 A. The measured 60 %
increase in efficiency at 1.8 A is lower than expected from simulations (100 %)
and previous measurements with solid state detectors (80 %). Gamma background
detection, bad focusing, and saturation effects most likely explain this
deviation. An upgrade of the natural Gd converter to enriched 157Gd would thus
lead to an efficiency increase of at least 60 %. The measurements presented in
this paper are the first successful time-of-flight measurements with the NMX
detector prototype and the ESS VMM readout.
