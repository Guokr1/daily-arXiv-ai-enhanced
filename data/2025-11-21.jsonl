While the proposed entropy function captures a broad class of gravitational entropy corrections, including Bekenstein-Hawking, Tsallis, and power-law forms, it does not encompass information-theoretic entropies such as Sharma-Mittal or Renyi. Within this framework, we derive exact analytical expressions for key cosmological observables, including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the dark energy density parameter $Ω_D(z)$, and the equation of state $w_D(z)$. A comprehensive parameter-space analysis reveals viable regions, particularly for $β> 1$ and small positive curvature, that accommodate elevated $H_0$ values consistent with recent SH0ES measurements. Our results offer a simple and analytically tractable alternative to conventional dynamical dark energy models, with potential relevance to the ongoing Hubble tension."}

The expanding joint vacuum of the all ingrediences of matter, including Standard Model particles and a dark matter sector, is treated as a thermal equilibrium state at temporal Gibbons-Hawking temperature, proportional to the Hubble parameter, and chemical potentials equal to particle masses. This theory provides not only the new mechanism of inflation and its graceful exit, but also explains acceleration of expansion for the late Universe. The formalism can be combined with the anomalous quantum gravity effects leading to a viable baryogenesis mechanism and certain bounds on dark matter particle masses and lifetimes."}

The commonly assumed power law form $a(t)=βt^α$ is shown to generate multiple solution branches, many of which can be considered to be 'unphysical', atleast to hold true globally, for all times. A hybrid solution, $a(t)=Ct^αe^{Dt^β}$ emerges in the special case $g_1=0$, where the quadratic Riemann-Cartan term vanishes. For $g_1\\not=0$, the equations become nonlinear, precluding closed-form analytic solutions.

Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/rdp/, we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications."}

In rare event searches, such as dark matter or neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, standard Geant4 simulations typically assume perfectly smooth surfaces, neglecting the microscopic roughness that exists in real materials. This simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions of energy deposition. To address this limitation, I developed SCoRe4, a Geant4-based library designed to simulate more realistic surface roughness based on experimentally measurable parameters. The code allows users to generate patches of simplified rough surface geometries across a wide range of scales - from square millimeters to square meters - while maintaining computational efficiency. SCoRe4 is open source and can be easily integrated into existing Geant4 setups. This work presents the structure, implementation, and example application of SCoRe4,as well as its potential use in improving the accuracy of background modeling in rare event physics."}

The coefficients of $m(U)$ obey closed Hyper-Catalan (HC) recurrences, allowing termwise derivatives and truncation control from the characteristic system. We also use the same form for a short HC predictor-corrector: evaluate the series within its certified radius and apply a brief Newton polish near the boundary. We define an HC signature (first nonzero kernel coefficients) and an HC spectrum (branch points and analyticity radius $ρ_U$), which quantify sparsity, stiffness, and safe evaluation domains. The construction covers folds and cusps of any global degree. On a binary fold and cusp, an artificial decic with a resonant unit, and two triple-lens cusps of a challenging geometry, HC seeds plus a few Newton steps recover the exact images to machine precision within the certified domain and maintain continuity under continuation.

Our experimental results further reveal that the twist angle induces a synergistic evolution between lattice symmetry and topological characteristics, enabling the mutual transformation and stable coexistence of different skyrmion family members within a single system. More importantly, we demonstrate that such a platform supports the discontinuous transport of Lamb-wave-induced topological textures, revealing phason-like dynamics within the quasiperiodic structure.

This measurement is performed via detection of electrons and protons in delayed coincidence using custom large-area segmented silicon drift detectors. We present the characterization of one such detector system to establish the proton energy and timing response, using a dedicated proton accelerator. The detected proton peak was studied for 25 keV, 30 keV, and 35 keV incident protons on a set of detector segments and multiple cooling cycles over a one year period. Ionization losses were consistent with models of the detector dead layer with thicknesses less than 100nm. The detected proton peak was stable within the uncertainty from energy calibration (0.2 keV). The rise times of detector pulses from $^{109}$Cd and $^{113}$Sn conversion electron sources were used to extract the impurity density profile and establish a precise model for the detector timing response. The observed impurity density profile varied from $(2 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the center to $(26 \\pm 2) \\times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ at the edge.

However, traditional manual techniques are inadequate for processing the massive, heterogeneous datasets generated by modern radio surveys. In this study, we present a probabilistic machine learning framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for feature extraction with Bayesian ensemble learning to achieve robust, scalable radio galaxy classification. The SVD approach effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving key morphological structures, enabling efficient representation of galaxy features. To mitigate class imbalance and avoid the introduction of artefacts, we incorporate a Local Neighbourhood Encoding strategy tailored to the astrophysical distribution of galaxy types. The resulting features are used to train and optimize several baseline classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons within bagging, boosting, and stacking ensembles governed by a Bayesian weighting scheme. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian ensembles outperform their traditional counterparts across all metrics, with the Bayesian stacking model achieving a classification accuracy of 99.0% and an F1-score of 0.99 across Compact, Bent, Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR-I), and Type II (FR-II) sources. Interpretability is enhanced through SHAP analysis, which highlights the principal components most associated with morphological distinctions. Beyond improving classification performance, our framework facilitates uncertainty quantification, paving the way for more reliable integration into next-generation survey pipelines. This work contributes a reproducible and interpretable methodology for automated galaxy classification in the era of data-intensive radio astronomy."}

Sin., 2025, 74(12):124301", "summary": "Plate structures are widely used in large-scale engineering fields such as aerospace, hull manufacturing, and construction. However, the plate structure is easily damaged during long-term service or when it is impacted by foreign objects. Such a damage may lead to serious safety accidents. Beamforming and L-shaped sensor cluster (LSSC) localization method can be used to locate the damage on the plate. However, when using beamforming or LSSC localization method to locate the damages on plate-like structures, there exists blind area. In this paper, by combining the beamforming and LSSC localization method, a fan-shaped sensor cluster is proposed through arranging five sensors in a fan shape, which can effectively reduce the blind areas. The positions of damages on the plate can be accurately detected by using two groups of fan-shaped sensor clusters and one sensor for transmitting the excitation signal. The feasibility of the fan-shaped sensor cluster localization method is verified through numerical simulations and experiments, and the results are compared with those obtained by using the T-shaped sensor cluster. The results show that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can more accurately identify the damages at different positions. Both simulation and experimental results indicate that the fan-shaped sensor cluster can improve the accuracy of damage location."}

In the next step, some thermodynamic features of a system of $n$-dimensional harmonic oscillators are studied by computing the deformed partition function. The results show that the number of microstates decreases because there is an upper bound on the momentum within the polymer framework. We found that in the high-temperature regime, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is close to the Planck length, $n$ degrees of freedom of the system are frozen in this setup. In other words, there is an effective reduction in space dimensions from $n$ to $\\frac{n}{2}$ in the polymeric framework, which also signals the fractional dimension for odd-dimensional oscillators."}

Circuit simulations confirm the feasibility of the multiplexing design and guide the selection of suitable diodes to preserve SiPM signal integrity. Electronic tests show that the proposed design exhibits low crosstalk among electronic channels, and preserves linearity over a dynamic range spanning a few to several hundred photoelectrons.

Remarkably, this feature emerges not only for positive GUP parameter but also for negative GUP parameter. From the initial acceleration, we deduce that the negative GUP parameter is more preferable. We also obtain maximum Hubble parameter from the first Friedmann equation, indicating a universe without initial singularity. Moreover, we compute the Kretschmann curvature scalar, again indicating a non-singular universe. Interestingly, we find that GUP-modified Friedmann equations share some similarities with braneworld cosmolgy where the quadratic term in energy density appears.

The PBR instrument consists of a 1.1 m aperture Schmidt telescope, similar to the POEMMA design, with two cameras in its hybrid focal surface: a Fluorescence Camera (FC) and a Cherenkov Camera (CC), both mounted on a frame that can be tilted to point from nadir up to 13 degrees above the horizon. The FC camera is designed to detect the fluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the detection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. The FC will be made of 4 Photo Detection Modules (PDMs), each consisting of a 6x6 matrix of 64-channel Multi Anode PhotoMulTipliers (MAPMT), for a grand total of 2304 pixels for each PDM. Custom-designed SPACIROC-3 ASICs perform single photoelectron counting on each pixel as well as charge integration on groups of 8 pixels to measure extremely bright or fast signals, reaching a double pulse resolution in the order of 10 ns for a 1 microsecond acquisition gate. A field flattener lens and a BG3 filter, to match the wavelength range of interest (300-400 nm), are mounted in front of the PDM. The camera will be able to detect showers in a field of view of 24x24 square degrees, with a pixel size on ground corresponding to 115 m. Details on the camera design and implementation will be given, along with the expected performance and the state of the construction."}

Progress has been made in the covariant formulation of LQG, but the tools do not carry over to the canonical formulation. These tools are graphical by nature, describing space with spin networks to make calculations in LQG more intuitive to the human hand.\n  Recently, a new notation for working with spin networks has been used by arXiv:2412.20272 to offer the first accurate numerical results in canonical LQG by allowing the underlying graphs to change throughout the calculation, though they are forced to concede visual intuitiveness. In this thesis, we offer a more radical rephrasing of spin network calculations by translating them into the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, extending previous attempts to translate into the standard (qubit) ZX-calculus (arXiv:2111.03114). Specifically, we derive the mixed-dimensional ZX-diagrams representing the generating objects of spin networks and the rules for the Penrose Spin Calculus (arXiv:2511.06012), and use these to present the ZX-form and correctness of \"loop removal\". We also derive the forms for several fundamental LQG objects in the finite-dimensional ZX-calculus for the first time. This gives us a high-level, intuitive graphical language that retains a flexibility to handle changing graph structures, and thus we argue positions the PSC as the new definitive language for canonical LQG.\n  Furthermore, we investigate the possibility for a matrix-like normal form for spin networks deriving from a novel perspective of the PSC in terms of W-nodes."}

We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \\approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs.

This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints."}

The analysis focuses on three independent components: the rate at which neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits energy in the surrounding region, the geometric contribution to the phase accumulated by neutrino mass eigenstates, and the modifications to flavor conversion produced by weak gravitational lensing. Working with a two-flavor system, both mass orderings are examined, and the calculation incorporates the interference between distinct trajectories reaching the detector. The numerical results show that the Lorentz-violating deformation substantially increases the efficiency of the annihilation channel, produces characteristic shifts in the oscillation phase not present in earlier bumblebee configurations, and reshapes the angular dependence of the lensing-induced flavor transition pattern."}

We find a period of increased uncertainty and offsets in the rotation term between 2018 and 2021, as seen in a previous analysis of WFC3/UVIS linear geometric distortion (O'Connor et al., 2024), corresponding with a period of increased jitter.

The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $α$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \\emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $ζ\\leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios."}

The primary GS holds the boresight fixed and the secondary GS keeps the orientation fixed. However, HST is also able to track using only a single GS by fixing the boresite on one star and maintaining the orientation using the available gyro(s). We evaluate the pointing quality achieved in this latter case, when one GS and one gyro (RGM, a.k.a., reduced gyro mode) are used. We find that in 1GS-RGM, there is indeed more drift during the course of an orbit than when two guide stars are used, but the drift is much smaller than was seen in previous times of sub-optimal gyro performance. We quantify the 1GS-RGM drift seen in recent archival GO data and in images from a test calibration program and find that (a) for exposures < 500 sec, the PSF quality in 1GS is indistinguishable from that of 2GS and (b) over the course of full orbits (~2500 sec), the drift in four of five cases was less than 0.2 pixel and ~0.4 pix in the other case. Such a drift is marginally detectable in observations, but it should have a marginal impact on most science programs, since the variation in the PSF caused by drift is smaller than the PSF variations with focus and with location on the detector. For observers who wish to correct drift effects, we show that the use of a perturbed PSF during post-acquisition data analysis removes essentially all astrometric residuals, even for drift levels up to ~0.5 pix, as well as most of the photometric residuals."}

Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+αT$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations."}

IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the \"I3T concept\", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called \"Butterfly's Eye\" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars."}

We present a Bayesian polarization calibration and imaging method using Bayesian imaging software resolve for VLBI data sets, that explores the posterior distribution of antenna-based gains, polarization leakages, and polarimetric images jointly from pre-calibrated data. We demonstrate our calibration and imaging method with observations of the quasar 3C273 with the VLBA at 15 GHz and the blazar OJ287 with the GMVA+ALMA at 86 GHz. Compared to the CLEAN method, our approach provides physically realistic images that satisfy positivity of flux and polarization constraints and can reconstruct complex source structures composed of various spatial scales. Our method systematically accounts for calibration uncertainties in the final images and provides uncertainties of Stokes images and calibration solutions. The automated Bayesian approach for calibration and imaging will be able to obtain high-fidelity polarimetric images using high-quality data from next-generation radio arrays.

An application of this result to black hole (BH) physics allows one to estimate a new quantum limit to general relativity. It is indeed shown that, for every real Schwarzschild BH, the maximum gravitational acceleration occurs, without becoming infinite, when the Schwarzschild radial coordinate reaches the gravitational radius. This means that quantum corrections to general relativity become necessary not at the Planck scale, as the majority of researchers in the field think, but at the Schwarzschild scale, in agreement with recent interesting results in the literature. In other words, the quantum nature of physics, which in this case manifests itself through the GUP, appears to prohibit the existence of real singularities, in this current case forbiddiing the gravitational acceleration of a Schwarzschild BH from becoming infinite."}
