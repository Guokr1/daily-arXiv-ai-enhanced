However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades."}

During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC's Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?. Here we outline how the UK must fit within this strategic context, suggest approaches and development for the future, and outline the unique capabilities and leadership of scientists across the UK."}

In particular, coronagraph instrumentation needs to be matured for higher throughput, deeper contrasts, and better broadband performance, while also considering their sensitivity and ability to mitigate the impact of telescope instability and wavefront error (WFE), which can have a profound impact on exo-Earth imaging. The success of various proposed HWO mission architectures is often represented by the estimated exo-Earth candidate yield. Computation of the minimum exposure time to achieve the required signal-to-noise on a given target, using an exposure time calculator (ETC), is a key part of yield estimation. The impacts of coronagraph sensitivity, WFE, and wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) have been well studied in the context of developing error budgets for missions and instruments such as the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, but there is currently no easily accessible way to incorporate the effects of these key parameters into calculating exposure times for HWO. To address this, we developed the Error Budget Software (EBS) - an open-source tool that synthesizes sensitivity, WFE, and WFS&C information for a variety of temporal and spatial scales and directly interfaces with the open-source yield code EXOSIMS to produce exposure times. We demonstrate how EBS can be used for mission error budgeting using the example of the Ultrastable Observatory Roadmap Team (USORT) observatory design. This includes both single and multi-variate parameter explorations using EBS where we identify trends between raw contrast and wavefront error, and detector noise and energy resolution."}

The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy."}

Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly \"disruptors\", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics."}

These material systems serve as an excellent platform for controlling waves, such as engineering wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps. However, combining one or more of these exotic features within the same unit cell design remains a challenge. Moreover, once a metamaterial is realized, its dispersive properties are usually fixed. In this work, we present a tunable passive hierarchical metamaterial capable of exhibiting wavenumber band gaps, flat bands, and zero-frequency band gaps within the same dispersion curve. Our metamaterial is composed of magnetic elements confined within a fixed magnetic boundary. The metamaterial can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic boundary, which in turn can alter the lattice periodicity. We open wavenumber band gaps by incorporating magnetic coupling within the unit cell elements, resulting in negative physical stiffness. The tunability of the magnetic coupling also enables complete flattening of the dispersion bands. Moreover, the ground stiffness within our unit-cell design causes the opening of zero-frequency band gaps. We present our approach through a combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental methods. The analytical framework provides a blueprint for obtaining each of these exotic dispersion characteristics. The numerical analysis, using both linear and nonlinear models, validates our analytical predictions, which we further confirm through experimental demonstrations. Our work opens the door to exploring magnetic tunability and hierarchy in engineering metamaterial systems with exotic properties that can be harnessed in advanced acoustic and mechanical devices."}

This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions."}

Sensitivity to slow neutrons was achieved using boron-coated CR-39 (BCR) detectors, which register charged particle tracks arising from the $^{10}$B$(n,α)^{7}$Li reaction. These detectors were positioned adjacent to identically prepared uncoated CR-39 control detectors (CCR), which are effectively insensitive to slow neutrons and serve to quantify background contributions from charged particles and fast neutrons under the present experimental conditions. A reproducible differential detector signature (BCR $>$ CCR) would thus indicative of slow neutron fluences. Across multiple independent D$_2$O electrolysis experiments in $0.25~\\mathrm{T}$ field, the BCR exhibited significantly excess track signals relative to CCRs. Under these conditions, the observed differential response corresponds to an inferred detector-equivalent slow neutron flux of approximately $(6.7 \\pm 0.2)~\\mathrm{cm^{-2},s^{-1}}$. Removal of the magnetic field resulted in a reduction of the differential signal by a factor of $\\sim6$, indicating a strong empirical dependence on the applied field. In contrast, H$_2$O electrolysis performed under otherwise identical conditions produced no measurable differential detector response, establishing the necessity of deuterated electrochemical conditions for the observed effect. The results are reported strictly as detector signatures consistent with slow neutron capture and do not assert any theoretical explanation. Instead, this work establishes a control verified and detector validated experimental protocol for detecting low flux slow neutrons, and provides empirical constraints relevant to slow neutron studies in experiments involving metal-deuteride systems."}

For $κ=1$, we construct five independent first integrals -- an autonomous Hamiltonian, two KY-generated Killing invariants, a linear Rüdiger constant, and a quadratic Carter-Rüdiger constant -- establishing Liouville-Arnold integrability at quadratic order in spin. For $κ\\neq 1$, the symmetry-generated invariants are not conserved in general and integrability does not persist at this order. The proof proceeds via covariant Poisson-bracket computations using a null bivector decomposition; Kerr is recovered as a special case.

A slender-beam structure instrumented with collocated piezoelectric sensor-actuator pairs distributed periodically along the length is used as the host medium, with decentralized second-order low-pass resonant filter with negative position feedback controllers implemented in real time on an FPGA platform. Unlike conventional approaches that assess bandgap formation through tip displacement, this study relies on bending strain minimization of piezoelectric sensors as the principal indicator of control-induced bandgaps. This reflects more accurately the moment-based phase cancellation dynamics similar to resonator behavior. We derive analytical expressions for transmissibility in an n x n decentralized feedback architecture and verify them experimentally using a 7 x 7 unit-cell configuration. The findings show that resonant controllers with negative feedback applied at the unit-cell level can be systematically tuned through controller gain and damping to open targeted low-frequency bandgaps and significantly improve vibration attenuation. By shifting the focus to localized dynamics, this work deepens the understanding of how control-induced bandgaps emerge and demonstrates a scalable pathway for designing programmable mechatronic metamaterials based on unconventional resonator behavior."}

Accurate photometric calibration of astronomical photographic plates remains a fundamental challenge in astronomy, especially when bridging historical photographic data with modern observations due to the mismatch of spectral sensitivities of photographic plates and passbands of modern calibration catalogs.

We intend to derive consistent natural magnitudes for celestial sources within the intrinsic photometric systems of astronomical photographic plates by using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) low-resolution spectral data and to show its superiority to former methods. Methods. We compiled spectral characteristic data for emulsions and filters applied in photometric observations using glass plates. The collected color sensitivities, modified by atmospheric reddening depending on the air mass, are then used to compute accurate natural magnitudes and fluxes of objects in the photographic plates through synthetic photometry, utilizing a catalog of Gaia spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the wavelength range 330 nm to 1050 nm (XP spectra). This process uses GaiaXPy, a Python library designed to handle Gaia DR3 spectral data. These natural magnitudes are then compared with results from the color term method used to compile the data in existing photoplate archives. Results. Comparing the synthetic magnitudes with those existing in the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE), we were able to reveal systematic errors of the existing data in the range of +/-0.3 mag and higher.

The phase fluctuation of the injection-locked magnetron, without the presence of a phase-locked loop, measured nearly 2.5 degree.

Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge."}

By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $θ_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state."}

Under review at Nonlinear Dynamics", "summary": "This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems."}

These environments frequently undergo modifications, such as the inclusion of different auxiliary devices depending on the experiment or facility, adding further complexity. The successful management of such dynamic configurations demands a flexible and robust system capable of controlling data acquisition, monitoring experimental setups, enabling seamless reconfiguration, and integrating new devices with limited effort.\n  This paper presents Constellation, a flexible and network-distributed control and data acquisition software framework tailored to laboratory and beamline environments, that addresses the limitations of existing solutions. The framework is designed with a focus on extensibility, providing a streamlined interface for instrument integration. It supports efficient system setup via network discovery mechanisms, promotes stability through autonomous operational features, and provides comprehensive documentation and supporting tools for operators and application developers such as controllers and logging interfaces.\n  At the core of the architectural design is the autonomy of the individual components, called satellites, which can make independent decisions about their operation and communicate these decisions to other components. This paper introduces the design principles and framework architecture of Constellation, presents the available graphical user interfaces, shares insights from initial successful deployments, and provides an outlook on future developments and applications."}

It combines a fast particle-tree (PT) algorithm for long-range forces with a high-accuracy particle-particle (PP, direct $N$-body) solver for short-range interactions. Preserving both PT efficiency and PP accuracy requires a robust PT-PP switching criterion. We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($σ$-based) criterion. Using the \\textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$σ$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $σ$-based criterion is better suited for high-$σ$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $σ$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters."}

In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger."}

While the automotive industry relies on the SAE J3016 standard, current taxonomies for autonomous science presuppose an owner-operator model that is incompatible with the operational rigidities of Large-Scale User Facilities. Here, we propose the Benchmarking Autonomy in Scientific Experiments (BASE) Scale, a 6-level taxonomy (Levels 0-5) specifically adapted for these unique constraints. Unlike owner-operator models, User Facilities require zero-shot deployment where agents must operate immediately without extensive training periods. We define the specific technical requirements for each tier, identifying the Inference Barrier (Level 3) as the critical latency threshold where decisions shift from scalar feedback to semantic digital twins. Fundamentally, this level extends the decision manifold from spatial exploration to temporal gating, enabling the agent to synchronise acquisition with the onset of transient physical events. By establishing these operational definitions, the BASE Scale provides facility directors, funding bodies, and beamline scientists with a standardised metric to assess risk, define liability, and quantify the intelligence of experimental workflows."}

In this paper, we report the development and testing of the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA)-film, a modular SDL for electrochemically synthesizing polymer films and then determining their water contact angle as a measure of surface energy. The system is designed to be highly modular and based upon a lowcost gantry platform to facilitate adoption. In addition to validating fluid handling and electrochemical tasks, we introduce two novel modular capabilities that enable PANDA-film to run sustained campaigns to study the wetting properties of films: (1) an electromagnetic capping/decapping system to mitigate fluid evaporation, and (2) a top-down optical method to determine water contact angle based upon reflectance. These capabilities are validated by depositing and characterizing a poly(allyl methacrylate) (PAMA) film using electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN).

Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count.

We analyze photon motion and show that circular photon orbits remain unstable, giving rise to a well-defined black hole shadow. Our results indicate that the shadow size grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. We also investigate thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature and energy emission, and find a strong dependence on dimensionality.

This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}

Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced."}

Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordström, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\\mathcal{O}(Λ)$ and mixed $\\mathcal{O}(ΛM)$ contributions to the total deflection angle."}

The 2-View approach suffers from combinatorial ghost hits, that the false 3D candidates arising from fiber projection ambiguities, degrading reconstruction performance in high-multiplicity events.

However, these detectors typically have pixel sizes about ten times larger than those of direct electron detectors commonly used for imaging and more prominent electron multiple scattering effects. To overcome these limitations, machine learning approaches can be utilized to reconstruct the electron entrance point and achieve super-resolution. As this process is inherently stochastic, and machine learning relies on suitable training data, high-quality, representative training data are essential for developing models that achieve the best possible resolution. In this work, we present two novel experimental methods for generating such training data. The first method employs precise microscope alignment to scan the detector plane using a finely focused electron beam of 2 μm diameter, enabling controlled sub-pixel mapping. The second method utilizes specially designed aperture masks with sub-pixel-sized holes to accurately localize electron entry points. We developed and validated two experimental strategies for collecting training data at acceleration voltages of 60, 80, 120, and 200 keV, which enable sub-pixel labeling for hybrid pixel detectors.

Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case."}

This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism."}

However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption.

To appear in PRD", "summary": "We investigate gravitational collapse driven solely by a self-interacting Brans--Dicke (BD) scalar field in the absence of ordinary matter. In this framework, the spacetime dynamics are governed solely by the scalar field $Φ$, endowed with a self-interaction potential $V(Φ)$ and non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar through the Brans--Dicke action. We numerically solve for the evolution of $Φ(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(Φ)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation. Our analysis demonstrates that, for the energy densities $ρ\\approx 1/a$ and $ρ\\approx -\\ln a$, the collapse inevitably leads to the formation of a central curvature singularity while consistently satisfying the weak energy condition. We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse."}

Our simulation reveals a banana-shape deformation of the ``black holes'' involved, and a typhoon-like spiral structure in the merger product. Using an eXact One-Body approach, we compute the full gravitational waveform of this process and qualitatively reproduce results consistent with those of numerical relativity. Our simulation offers a transparent link between the feature of gravitational waveforms and the internal structure of black holes, thus a complementary interpretation of physics behind numerical relativity."}

These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}
