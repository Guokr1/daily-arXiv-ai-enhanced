Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop\nrods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation\nthrough folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities. Previous studies have\nshown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural\ncurvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar\nring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations. Here,\nwe propose a 2D-to-3D shape transformation strategy for ring origami by\nintroducing out-of-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state\nlies in a plane perpendicular to the planar ring) into the rod segments. Due to\nnatural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring\nspontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration.\nThese snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable\nself-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of\ncomplex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design\nof functional deployable and foldable structures.

However,\ncompared to X-rays and GeV/TeV gamma-rays, this range suffers from lower\nsensitivity by orders of magnitude. The upcoming NASA SMEX satellite mission\nCompton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI), scheduled for launch in 2027, is\nexpected to break through this limitation with its Compton telescope utilizing\na germanium semiconductor detector, covering the 0.2-5 MeV energy range. In\naddition to the main instrument, two Background and Transient Observer (BTO)\ndetectors will be installed on COSI. The detectors are NaI(Tl) scintillators\ncoupled with SiPMs, and they are being developed as a student collaboration\nproject. BTO aims to 1) measure background radiation in orbit to maximize\nCOSI's sensitivity and 2) detect GRBs and other gamma-ray transients. For this\npurpose, it is required to cover the lower-energy range from 30 keV to 2 MeV\nwith < 20% FWHM energy resolution. In addition, large signals and afterglow\ngenerated by heavy ions penetrating the NaI(Tl) crystal should be appropriately\nhandled. To address these requirements, we have developed a compact signal\nprocessing and data acquisition system comprised of two main components: an\nanalog board and a digital board. The analog board amplifies signals from the\nSiPM, generates triggers, and performs AD conversion. The digital board\nfeatures a Microchip SAMV71 microcontroller, and we developed the software to\ncontrol the analog board, read ADC data via SPI interface, add timestamps, and\nbuffer event data. Through this development, we achieved the required wide\nbandpass and an energy resolution of 10% FWHM at 662 keV with a processing time\nof 20 us per event. We also implemented veto signal generation for large\nsignals using a discriminator and an onboard detection algorithm for transient\nevents."}

A\nlong-standing controversial issue is whether the one-loop corrections to tensor\nperturbations exist on large scales. Firstly, we demonstrate through direct\none-loop calculations that one-loop corrections cancel each other out on large\nscales. We then proceed from the symmetry of the interacting system and\ndirectly prove, based on the Ward identity, the absence of one-loop corrections\non large scales-without the need for specific loop diagram calculations. This\nis consistent with the results we previously obtained for scalar perturbations."}

In this contribution, we discuss the prospect of observing metal\nsulfides such as MgS and FeS in absorption experiments carried out with the\nFIRESS instrument onboard PRIMA using its low resolution observing mode.

This two-mode\nanalysis yields a redshifted final mass of $305.6^{+35.7}_{-47.3}M _{\\odot}$\nand a final spin of $0.84^{+0.07}_{-0.14}$ at $90\\%$ credibility, from a\nringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $14.5$.\nFurthermore, a test of the no-hair theorem performed using the two detected\nmodes reveals no deviation from the predictions of general relativity. These\nresults highlight the power of the F-statistic methodology to uncover nuanced\nfeatures in gravitational wave signals, thereby providing novel insights into\nthe fundamental properties of black holes."}

In SG quantum fields curve classical spacetime in an effective\nway through the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor, while\npropagating in the spacetime they curve. I discuss some advances in SG in three\ndirections: (i) in understanding structural properties or special solutions of\nSG in spacetimes with isometries or special Hadamard states (ii) in\nunderstanding the initial value formulation and (iii) in black hole evaporation\nand why information loss is not expected. Semiclassical frameworks beyond SG\nare briefly surveyed. The hope is that this short note will provide a good set\nof references and indicate interesting open problems and directions."}

The resulting geometrical dynamics is reformulated into the\nconnection dynamics, with the real SU(2)-connection serving as one of the\nconfiguration variables. This formulation allows us to extend the loop\nquantization scheme of general relativity to the vector-tensor theory, thereby\nrigorously constructing its quantum kinematical framework. The scalar\nconstraint is promoted to a well-defined operator in the vertex Hilbert space,\nto represent quantum dynamics. Moreover, the spherically symmetric model of the\nvector-tensor theory is obtained by the symmetric reduction. Following the\ngeneral deparametrization strategy for theories with diffeomorphism invariance,\nthe spherically symmetric model can be fully deparametrized in terms of the\ndegrees of freedom of the vector field. The corresponding reduced phase space\nquantization is carried out. The physical Hamiltonian generating relative\nevolution is promoted to a well-defined operator on the physical Hilbert space."}

In this\npaper, we study gravitational waves (GWs) induced by matter isocurvature\nfluctuations in a generic perfect fluid background as a novel probe of the\nphysics of the very early Universe. We analytically compute the induced GW\nkernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked\nisocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal\nis sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid\ndominating the early Universe after inflation. We find that the GW amplitude is\nenhanced for a soft equation of state. Our framework can be applied to dark\nmatter isocurvature and models leading to early matter-dominated eras, such as\nprimordial black holes and cosmological solitons."}

First, we assume that the background is homogeneous and\nisotropic, and that the three-form is coupled to both the Ricci scalar and the\nRicci tensor. We show that in this case, it propagates three degrees of\nfreedom: a scalar mode and two tensor ones. Then, we consider an anisotropic\nbackground that corresponds to a Bianchi Type I Universe, and set the coupling\nwith the Ricci tensor to zero. We show that, similarly to the Proca theory with\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity, this case leads to two branches for the\nbackground solutions - depending on the values of the 3-form. However, in\ncontrast to the Proca case, we show that no extra modes appear. We explore the\nno-ghost conditions and speed of propagation for all three modes in both\nbranches. Finally, we show that one of the branches can be written as a theory\nof a constrained scalar, coupled to a cuscuton field."}
