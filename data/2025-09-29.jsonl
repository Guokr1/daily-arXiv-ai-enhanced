The efficiency of these devices is strongly dependent on\nthe interaction length between the light and the nonlinear material, scaling\nquadratically with this parameter.

In this work, we demonstrate a\nsignificant progress in this field achieving the periodic poling of continuous\npoled areas of 70 mm length with a 3 microns poling period and a close to 50 %\nduty cycle. We compare two poling electrode design approaches to fabricate\nlong, continuous poled areas. The first approach involves the poling of a\nsingle, continuous 70 mm long electrode. The second utilize a segmented\napproach including the poling of more than 20 individual sections forming\ntogether a 70 mm long poling area with no stitching errors. While the\ncontinuous electrode allows for faster fabrication, the segmented approach\nallows to individually optimize the poling resulting in less duty cycle\nvariation. A detailed analysis of the periodic poling results reveals that the\nresults of both are consistent with previously reported poling outcomes for\nshorter devices.

This immediately implies that two twins may, in\ngeneral, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course,\nsome asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times\nare evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent.\nOur primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some\nlesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and\ncovariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related\nmisconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be\nperfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and\ndoes not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of\ndifferential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in\nthe prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering\nseveral pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that\na twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a\nstronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get\nyounger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker\ngravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always\nreturns younger than a geodesic one.

In radio astronomy, most time-domain detection methods cannot\nfind these pulsars, and current image-based detection approaches still face\nchallenges, including low sensitivity, high false positive rate, and low\ncomputational efficiency. In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger\n(FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection\nand localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches -- an image\ndomain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by\nincreasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from\nnoise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search\nefficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art\nsource finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for\nlarge images (50K x 50K pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8\ntimes (at 6$\\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the\nimage-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig\nmaintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than\nsurrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions.\nIn this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both\nreal-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets\nbased on MeerKAT and SKA AA2 telescope configurations. With its real-time\nprocessing capabilities and scalability, FITrig is a promising tool for\nnext-generation telescopes, such as the SKA, with the potential to uncover\nhidden ULP pulsars."}

The motivation behind\nthis method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector\nmaps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation\npurposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it\nsimultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the\nN+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered\nby the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with\nthe three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two\nStokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent\nset of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly\ndifferent bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded\npolarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly\ncross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and\npolarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are\nstrongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed\nto individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise\nand temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated\ndata with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage\nis greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected."}
