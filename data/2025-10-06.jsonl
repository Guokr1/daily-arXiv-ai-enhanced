Such models can be generalized to\nnonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled\nequivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our\napproach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of\ngravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on\nrelativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein\nequations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some\ngeneral off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton\ndynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently\ndescribed in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and\n(nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions\nof modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions\nin (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration\nfunctions and generating effective/ matter sources.

Our\noptimization focuses on a specific segment of the code responsible for\ncalculating the collapse time of each particle involved in the simulation. Due\nto the embarrassingly parallel nature of this computation, it represents an\nideal candidate for GPU offloading. As part of the porting process, we\ndeveloped fully GPU-native implementations of both cubic spline and bilinear\ninterpolation routines, required for evaluating collapse times. Since GNU\nScientific Library (GSL) does not support GPU offloading, these custom\nimplementations run entirely on the GPU and achieve residuals of only\n$\\sim0.003\\%$ when compared to the CPU-based implementation of GSL. Comparative\nbenchmarking on the LEONARDO (NVIDIA-based) and SETONIX (AMD-based)\nsupercomputers reveals notable portability and performance, with speedups\nof~\\textit{4x} and up to~\\textit{8x}, respectively. While collapse time\ncalculation is not a primary bottleneck in the overall workflow, the\nacceleration reduces full production runs by $\\sim 100$ seconds each leading to\na cumulative saving of $\\sim 160000$ Standard-h ($\\sim28$ hours wall time)\nacross thousands of simulations. Roofline analysis confirms that our GPU\nporting achieves over 80\\% of the theoretical FP64 peak performance, confirming\nefficient compute-bound execution. This work demonstrates that OpenMP\ndirectives offer a portable, effective strategy for accelerating large-scale\ncosmological simulations on heterogeneous hardware."}

This is in part thanks to the development of new\nscintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator\nreadout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors.\nIn order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a\ndetailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can\naffect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is\ntheir Birks' coefficienct, which correlates the relative light yield to the\nionization energy. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect\ncan be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a\nmeasurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from two different\ndetectors irradiated in the 20-80 keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in\nFerrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV,\nthey also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near\none of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution.\nHere, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce.

While previous\nwork has shown that Markovian evolution can generate entanglement and other\nnonclassical correlations in de Sitter backgrounds, the basis-dependent nature\nof coherence has so far limited its unambiguous interpretation. Here, we\nintroduce a basis-independent framework to quantify not only the total\ncoherence of two comoving detectors, but also its collective and localized\ncontributions, and we trace how each of these decomposed measures varies with\nthe inverse of Gibbons-Hawking temperature. By treating the detectors as open\nquantum systems interacting with a massless scalar field in the Bunch-Davies\nand squeezed alpha-vacua, we find that non-thermal squeezing substantially\nenhances extractable coherence, even under strong thermal effects.

The software is called Otus 3 and\nincorporates innovative ALAN diffusion models with different atmospheric\nprofiles, cloud covers and urban emission functions. To date, light pollution\nmodelling typically focused on calculating the zenith luminance of the skyglow\nproduced by city lights. In Otus 3 we extend this and additionally model the\nhorizontal illuminance on the ground, including the contributions from skyglow\nand the direct illumination. We applied Otus 3 to France using ground radiance\ndata from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS).
