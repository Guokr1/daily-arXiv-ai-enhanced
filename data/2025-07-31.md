### [1] [High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145)
*Slava G. Turyshev*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的后牛顿框架，用于覆盖六种时间尺度和三种参考系统的相对论计时与坐标转换，支持亚皮秒精度的时间同步和厘米级导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展IAU公约，为月球表面、低月球轨道等场景提供高精度的时间与频率传输、相对论大地测量等支持。

Method: 定义LCRS度量，保留高于5x10^{-18}的贡献和0.1 ps的计时项，推导TCB、TCG等时间尺度的闭式映射。

Result: 分析表明，需考虑l=9的谐波和l=8的潮汐效应以实现5x10^{-18}的稳定性，支持亚皮秒同步和厘米级导航。

Conclusion: 该框架为高精度时间传输、量子通信和基础物理实验提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and
coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL,
TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU
conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric
that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and
timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to
spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including
external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form
mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time
transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond
accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising
from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and
gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits,
at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis
demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to
achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock
synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This
framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic
geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond
low Earth orbit.

### [2] [Field theory vacuum and entropic dark energy models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22093)
*Michael Maziashvili*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文探讨了一种新的场论真空能量定义对宇宙学的影响，通过将自由场哈密顿量表示为傅里叶空间中的振荡器集合，研究了其质量尺度对引力的潜在意义，并推导出可能与黑洞熵界限相关的暗能量模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究场论中振荡器质量尺度的引力意义，尤其是其对黑洞能量限制和暗能量模型的潜在影响。

Method: 将自由场哈密顿量表示为傅里叶空间中的振荡器集合，分析其质量尺度与黑洞熵界限的关系。

Result: 发现振荡器的质量尺度可能与红外截止相关，且其数量饱和了黑洞熵界限，从而推导出多种暗能量模型。

Conclusion: 这种新的真空能量定义为暗能量研究提供了新的视角，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of a novel definition of field
theory vacuum energy. The free field Hamiltonian represented as an ensemble of
oscillators (in the Fourier space) usually implies the presence of mass scale
for these oscillators, which in quantum field theory is of little importance
since quantum energy spectrum of oscillator is mass independent. This mass
scale, however, may be interesting due to its possible gravitational
implications. Since black hole physics puts an upper limit on the total energy
within a given region, one obtains constraint on the number of field
oscillators. If the mass scale for field oscillators is set by the IR cutoff,
then this number saturates the black hole entropy bound. Following this
reasoning, one derives various kinds of dark energy models that maybe
interesting for further study.

### [3] [Deriving the Cosmological Constant and Nature's Constants from SU(3) Confinement Volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22096)
*Malak Ali,Ahmed Farag Ali*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文探讨了QCD禁闭、热力学第三定律和全息原理的相互作用，揭示了它们对解决基础物理中开放问题的潜在意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究这些物理原理的联合作用，以解决宇宙冷却至绝对零度时的真空碎片化和宇宙常数等问题。

Method: 结合QCD禁闭、热力学第三定律和全息原理，分析宇宙冷却过程中的物理现象。

Result: 提出宇宙真空碎片化为质子尺度域，并通过全息原理推导出普朗克尺度和宇宙常数的观测值。

Conclusion: 这些原理的联合作用为宇宙常数和量子引力问题提供了自然解释，无需精细调节。

Abstract: We explore the interplay between three well-established physical principles:
QCD confinement, the Third Law of Thermodynamics, and holography, and examine
how their combined implications may shed light on several open problems in
fundamental physics. As the Universe cools toward absolute zero, color
confinement fragments the vacuum into proton-scale domains. The Third Law,
which renders $T = 0$ unattainable and prohibits complete entropy elimination,
implies that these domains must persist. This leads to a natural count $N
\simeq (R_u / R_p)^3 \sim 10^{123}$, where $R_u$ is the radius of the cosmic
horizon and $R_p$ is the proton radius. Assuming holographic saturation, each
domain corresponds to a Planck-area patch on the cosmic horizon, allowing the
Planck length, and hence $\hbar$, $G$, and $c$, to emerge as geometric
quantities. The same tiling dilutes the bare Planck-scale vacuum energy by a
factor of $N$, reproducing the observed value of $\rho_\Lambda$ without
requiring fine-tuned counterterms.

### [4] [Kerr Black Holes in an Expanding Bubble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22114)
*Marco Astorino*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个四维广义相对论中的精确解析解，描述了一个膨胀的“无物泡”中任意数量克尔黑洞的共线排列，并研究了单个克尔黑洞的物理性质和热力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用逆散射技术构建解析解，分析克尔黑洞的物理和热力学性质。

Result: 发现膨胀的无物泡可以平衡两个克尔黑洞之间的引力吸引，形成平衡配置，且无需宇宙弦或支撑结构。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解克尔黑洞在动态背景下的行为提供了新的解析解和物理见解。

Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity,
describing a collinear array of an arbitrary number of Kerr black holes inside
an expanding bubble of nothing is built, thanks to the inverse scattering
technique. Physical properties and thermodynamics of the single Kerr in the
bubble are studied. No cosmic strings or struts are present. The binary black
hole system displays equilibrium configurations, because the expanding bubble
surrounding the black holes balances the mutual gravitational attraction of the
two constituents.

### [5] [Quantifying Systematic Biases in Black Hole Spectroscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22122)
*Sebastian H. Völkel,Arnab Dhani*

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑洞光谱分析存在系统性不确定性，影响引力波探测和模拟的准确性，需高效工具量化偏差。

Method: 采用线性信号分析，对比Fisher信息矩阵与贝叶斯采样，分析未建模的小贡献（如泛音、二次模式等）。

Result: 线性信号分析适用于中等信噪比（约50）下的简单环降模型，能有效预测偏差并解释高精度模拟中的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效识别系统性不确定性，有望提升黑洞光谱分析的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: How long after the merger of two black holes can one rely on linear
perturbation theory, and how many quasinormal modes are in the ringdown? Such
questions suggest that black hole spectroscopy suffers from systematic
uncertainties that potentially spoil ringdown analyses, both from high-accuracy
simulations and in data from gravitational wave detectors. In this work, we
demonstrate that linear-signal analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying
biases, allowing for detailed explorations that are computationally too
expensive for traditional Bayesian injection and recovery approaches. We
quantify the validity of the Fisher information matrix and bias formula by
comparing it to robust but slow Bayesian sampling. Working with flat noise in
the time domain, statistical errors and systematic biases can mostly be
detected analytically. Due to its efficiency, we provide detailed parameter
space analyses for potentially unmodeled small contributions from overtones,
quadratic modes, and tails. We find linear signal analysis well suited for
predicting biases in simple ringdown models at intermediate SNRs of order 50
when unmodeled effects are small. It is also valuable in explaining ongoing
issues in extracting quasinormal modes from high-precision simulations, as one
can understand them as high-SNR signals. Therefore, this approach offers
promising prospects for improving ringdown models by efficiently identifying
and incorporating systematic uncertainties, ultimately enhancing the accuracy
and robustness of black hole spectroscopy.

### [6] [Constraints on multi-fluid cosmology in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models with different observational data sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22191)
*Praveen Kumar Dhankar,Albert Munyeshyaka,Aritra Sanyal,Safiqul Islam,Farook Rahaman*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文通过结合红移空间畸变测量，研究了修正Gauss-Bonnet引力下多流体宇宙学中的大尺度结构增长，并利用MCMC方法约束模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究修正Gauss-Bonnet引力下多流体宇宙学中大尺度结构的增长，以验证和约束不同修正引力模型的参数。

Method: 使用三种修正Gauss-Bonnet引力模型，结合Friedmann方程、Hubble和BAO数据集，推导结构增长方程，并与红移空间畸变数据比较，通过MCMC分析约束模型参数。

Result: 获得了模型参数的最佳拟合值，包括Sigma_8，并与观测数据进行了对比验证。

Conclusion: 修正Gauss-Bonnet引力模型在多流体宇宙学框架下能够有效解释大尺度结构的增长，并通过观测数据验证了其合理性。

Abstract: In the present work, we incorporate redshift-space distortion measurement to
investigate the growth of large scale structure within the framework of
multi-fluid cosmology in the context of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Using
three different modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity models, we compare the
predictions of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity expansion history-through the
Friedmann equation with Hubble and BAO data sets and constrain models
parameters. Within the context of multi-fluid cosmology in modified
Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain the structure growth equation. This equation is
then combined with Sigma_8 to get f_Sigma_8 predictions-which is compared with
redshift-space distortion data to constrain models parameters to obtain
best-fit values including Sigma_8. This involves performing a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for these specific forms of modified Gauss-Bonnet
models.

### [7] [Resonant interactions from dynamical perturbers on generic orbits around an extreme mass ratio inspiral](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22260)
*Makana Silva,Harrison G. Blake-Goszyk,Christopher M. Hirata*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了极端质量比螺旋（EMRI）系统中第三体扰动对波形相位的影响，发现扰动虽小但可能显著改变波形相位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索EMRI在星系中心环境中受第三体扰动的影响，以改进引力波波形模型并测试强场引力理论。

Method: 扩展了先前的方法和代码工具，分析180个模拟轨道系统中的142,000次共振相互作用。

Result: 扰动对EMRI动力学影响微小，但可能导致波形相位变化约0.1弧度。

Conclusion: 研究方法和工具适用于多种共振情况，有助于开发更精确的波形模型，用于探测星系中心环境和测试引力理论。

Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are binary systems where a compact
object slowly inspirals into its much larger compact partner. Since we
anticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the
galactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying
these environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field
regime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the
mHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors.
However, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs
could be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze
potential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance.
We use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this
series [Silva \& Hirata, {\slshape Phys. Rev. D} {\bfseries 106}:084508 (2022)]
and expand them to account for a general outer body orbit, allowing for
multiple resonant interactions within an orbit and across a variety of SMBH
spins. We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions
across a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause
changes to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead
to potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian.
Detectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could
be a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing
accurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and
pipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various
perturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing
more accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and
test theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs.

### [8] [Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417)
*Anik Chakraborty*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文构建了一个(1+1)维的Jackiw-Teitelboim引力玩具模型，其欧几里得时空流形为Möbius带M。由于M不可定向，其自旋统计结构为Pin而非Spin。通过分析Pin结构和Dirac算子，论文得出了动量量子化、谱对称性等结果，并探讨了JT引力中的非微扰效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非定向流形（如Möbius带）在引力理论中的作用，特别是Pin结构对物理性质的影响。

Method: 构建Möbius带的通用定向覆盖，计算Stiefel-Whitney类，分类Pin结构，构造pinor丛，并分析Dirac算子在扭曲等变条件下的行为。

Result: 发现半整数动量量子化、谱对称性、模2指标为零，以及η_D(0)=0。在JT引力中，Pin结构的两种不等价提升会加倍非微扰鞍点求和，但不改变主导的Bekenstein-Hawking熵。

Conclusion: 非定向流形和Pin结构在引力理论中具有重要物理意义，为相关研究提供了新的视角和工具。

Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim
gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$.
Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin
rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to
the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band,
which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a
$\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$,
classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor
bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance
condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum
quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$
follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the
non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for
completeness.

### [9] [Geodesics and Shadows in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22494)

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究了Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson时空中的测地线和黑洞阴影，发现零测地线方程可分离且可解析处理，而类时测地线通常不可分离。通过微扰展开推导了光子球和最内稳定圆轨道的近似解析表达式，并用数值和解析方法分析了黑洞阴影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson时空中测地线和黑洞阴影的特性，尤其是磁场对黑洞阴影的影响。

Result: 发现磁场、观测者倾角和径向位置对黑洞阴影有显著影响，并量化了与标准Kerr阴影的偏差。

Conclusion: 磁场在Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson时空中对黑洞阴影有重要影响，可通过渐近行为解释其物理意义。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate geodesics and black hole shadows in the
Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. We show that the equations of motion for null
geodesics are separable and admit analytical treatment, whereas timelike
geodesics are generally non-separable. Approximate analytical expressions for
the photon sphere and the innermost stable circular orbit are derived via
perturbative expansions in the magnetic field strength. We further explore the
black hole shadow using both numerical and analytical methods, examining the
effects of the magnetic field, the observer's inclination angle and radial
position. Deviations from the standard Kerr shadow are quantified, and a
physical interpretation is provided by introducing asymptotic regimes defined
relative to the magnetic field strength.

### [10] [Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22588)
*Adrian del Rio,Javier Olmedo,António Torres Manso*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文探讨了真空爱因斯坦方程与无源麦克斯韦理论的类比，揭示了引力波的电场和磁场分量，并研究了其对偶对称性及其量子化后的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究引力波的电-磁对偶对称性，以深化对引力波性质的理解，并探索其在量子化后的行为。

Method: 通过明确识别引力波的电场和磁场分量，建立对偶对称性的框架，并推导相关的守恒量和守恒定律。

Result: 发现对偶对称性在平直时空的量子化中保留，但在弯曲背景下异常破坏，可能导致左右旋引力子的不平衡激发。

Conclusion: 该研究推广了已知的费米子和光子场的反常现象，为质量自旋二场的量子行为提供了新见解。

Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the
source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an
electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this
analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components
of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that
duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields
constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the
associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the
difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized
components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and
anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when
the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We
then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality
symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it
is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between
right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect
represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known
results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.

### [11] [Convergence of Higher-Curvature Expansions Near the Horizon: Hawking Radiation from Regular Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22660)
*Roman. A. Konoplya,Alexander Zhidenko*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 论文研究了高阶曲率修正模型的黑洞解收敛速度，发现对于某些观测量的收敛很快，但对霍金辐射等敏感量的收敛较慢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高阶曲率修正模型的黑洞解在不同物理量上的收敛速度差异。

Method: 通过分析不同阶数修正对黑洞几何的影响，评估其对经典观测量和霍金辐射的收敛速度。

Result: 经典观测量在低阶修正下快速收敛，而霍金辐射等高敏感量需多阶修正才能接近无限级数结果。

Conclusion: 高阶曲率修正模型的收敛速度因物理量而异，需针对不同问题选择合适的修正阶数。

Abstract: A recently proposed model incorporating a series of higher-curvature
corrections allows for analytic black-hole solutions at each order of the
expansion, with a fully regular black hole emerging in the limit of infinite
number of terms. An important question that arises within this framework is how
rapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are
primarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential,
it has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often
within the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to
quantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the
geometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result
that is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms
are typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the
regular black hole in this context.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 重新分析并修正了关于Brans-Dicke-f(R)理论中紧凑双星系统引力辐射的研究，纠正了之前对耦合参数ω₀的下界分析，并重新评估了PSR J1012+5307的数据。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究中对Brans-Dicke耦合参数ω₀的下界分析存在错误，导致约束条件颠倒，需要修正。

Method: 重新分析PSR J1012+5307双星系统的数据，修正ω₀的约束条件，并探讨其在Brans-Dicke-f(R)理论中的新角色。

Result: 提出了修正后的ω₀约束条件，并指出其在标准BD理论中的解释与传统不同。

Conclusion: 修正后的分析为Brans-Dicke-f(R)理论中的引力辐射研究提供了更准确的约束条件。

Abstract: This note revisits and corrects a previous analysis on gravitational
radiation in compact binary systems within the framework of Brans-Dicke-f(R)
theories-models featuring both massless and effectively massive scalar fields.
We correct the lower bound on the Brans-Dicke coupling parameter $\omega_0$
presented in prior work, identifying teh issue that led to inverted
constraints. By reanalyzing data from the binary system PSR J1012+5307, we
present revised bounds on $\omega_0$ as a function of the geometrical scalar
field mass $m_f$, emphasizing that the role of $\omega_0$ differs from its
traditional interpretation in standard BD theory.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Kalb-Ramond引力框架下Schwarzschild-like黑洞的引力透镜现象，分析了光子偏转角和放大特性，并比较了不同拓扑结构的影响。

Result: 发现宇宙弦和弦云拓扑结构会系统性改变光子偏转角和放大特性，强场分析揭示了光子球附近的标度行为。

Conclusion: 研究为区分奇异黑洞和传统时空几何提供了理论依据，并通过观测数据限制了参数范围。

Abstract: This theoretical investigation examines gravitational lensing phenomena in
Schwarzschild-like black holes (BHs) within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity frameworks
incorporating cosmic string (CS) and cloud of strings (CoS) topological
configurations. We develop comprehensive analytical methodologies for
investigating photon deflection angles and magnification characteristics in
both Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity pierced by CSs (SKRCS) and
Schwarzschild-like BHs in KR gravity with CoS (SKRCoS) spacetime geometries
through dual approaches: perturbative expansions yielding approximate solutions
and exact elliptic integral formulations providing complete mathematical
descriptions across parameter spaces. For CS configurations characterized by
Lorentz violation (LV) and CS parameters, deflection angles exhibit systematic
modifications through composite geometric factors, while CoS geometries
demonstrate distinct deflection characteristics incorporating additional
topological parameters that fundamentally alter light propagation dynamics.
Magnification analysis reveals distinctive critical curve positioning
modifications and amplitude scaling relationships enabling observational
discrimination between exotic BH scenarios and conventional spacetime
geometries. Strong field analysis utilizing established mathematical frameworks
establishes logarithmic divergence coefficients characterizing fundamental
scaling behavior in photon sphere proximity regimes. Observational constraints
from Solar System precision tests restrict LV parameters within stringent
bounds, while galactic-scale observations permit expanded parameter ranges for
CS and CoS configurations.

Method: 对Schwarzschild和Kerr黑洞进行中性标量场扰动，对Reissner-Nordstrom和Kerr-Newman黑洞使用带电标量场扰动。

Result: 潮汐Love数因宇宙学常数始终非零；潮汐耗散在特定条件下可消失。

Conclusion: 宇宙学常数对黑洞潮汐响应有显著影响，Love数始终存在，而耗散现象受参数调控。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating
black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field
perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged
scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black
holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always
nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal
dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's
frequency and the black hole's parameters.

Motivation: 探讨引力子通过量子粒子产生对CMB温度涨落的影响，特别是在红外截止模型中的表现。

Method: 计算了CMB温度涨落的相关函数，考虑了最后散射壳的有限厚度和红移分离的影响。

Result: 发现角度和红移上存在显著的反相关，反相关最小值相对于中心相关最大值分别为20%和50%。

Conclusion: 引力子产生的张量扰动在CMB温度涨落中表现出明显的反相关特征，这对理解早期宇宙的物理过程具有重要意义。

Abstract: Inflationary tensor perturbations are treated as arising from a bath of
gravitons produced by quantum particle creation at the end of inflation. We
calculate the correlation function of the CMB temperature fluctuations produced
by these gravitons in a model with an infrared cut off. The CMB photons are
emitted from within a last scattering shell of finite thickness in redshift. We
find the correlation function in terms of the separation of a pair of spacetime
points of emission in both angle and redshift. In both variables, there is a
significant amount of anti-correlation. The anti-correlation minimum has a
relative magnitude compared to the central correlation maximum of about 20% in
angle and 50% in redshift.

eccentricity from TEOBResumS modeling parameter estimations and have confronted
them independently with full numerical generated waveforms from our bank of
nearly two thousand simulations of binary black holes. We have used RIFT for
Bayesian parameter estimation and found that GW200208\_{22} KDE estimates favor
eccentricities $e_{20} = 0.217_{-0.184}^{+0.076}$ upon entering the LVK band at
$\sim20$Hz within a 90\% confidence limit. Within this event analysis we
employed 39 new targeted full numerical relativity simulations and we have thus
found a top improved likelihood $\ln \mathcal{L}$ matching waveform, compared
to model-based analysis, with an estimated eccentricity at 20Hz,
$e_{20}=0.200$, thus reinforcing the eccentric hypothesis of the binary. We
have also used our full bank of numerical waveforms on GW190620 finding that it
favors eccentricities in the range of {$0\leq e_{10}\leq0.3$}. New specifically
targeted simulations will be required to narrow this eccentricity range.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解PeLEDs在高注入条件下的效率滚降现象，以优化器件性能、热设计、封装和操作寿命。

Method: 模型自洽地考虑了正反馈机制，包括温度依赖的载流子复合、空间电荷效应、焦耳热和热传输。

Abstract: Here, we report a comprehensive modeling framework to unravel the efficiency
roll-off in Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Our model
self-consistently accounts for a positive feedback mechanism which involves
diverse phenomena like temperature-dependent carrier recombination, space
charge effects, Joule heating, and thermal transport. Model predictions compare
well with experimental results such as dark current-voltage characteristics and
efficiency as well as radiance roll-off under high injection conditions. This
work identifies key performance limiting phenomena in current state-of-the-art
PeLEDs and could be of broad relevance towards device optimization, thermal
design, packaging, and operational lifetime.

### [18] [Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22750)
*Philipp del Hougne*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分阶段处理RIS元素间互耦（MC）矩阵估计的方法，解决了大规模MC参数估计的扩展性问题，并通过实验验证了其高精度和优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RIS元素间互耦参数随元素数量平方增长，传统方法难以扩展且存在模糊性问题，需要一种高效且准确的估计方法。

Method: 将RIS元素分组，分三阶段估计MC：1）估计一组MC及负载特性；2）估计剩余组的MC，部分重叠已估计组；3）估计组间MC。支持并行化和高效初始化。

Result: 实验验证了100元素RIS的5867参数模型精度达40.5 dB，显著优于无MC感知的基准模型（17.0 dB和13.8 dB）。优化RIS后，MC感知对性能提升有限，但对预测可靠性至关重要。

Conclusion: 分阶段MC估计方法高效且准确，MC感知虽对优化性能提升有限，但对模型预测可靠性影响显著。

Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a
physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation
of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters
grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability
challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments
of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully
handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation
problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition
the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well
as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate
the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with
an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between
each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the
second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can
furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate
our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a
rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter
multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark
models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB,
respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the
RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with
the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC
awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we
observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of
model-based predictions of the expected performance.

Abstract: Neutrinos, elusive and abundant, interact weakly with matter, making
detection challenging. This thesis explores neutrino physics, focusing on mass
hierarchy and oscillations, with emphasis on India's upcoming INO facility. The
Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector, using Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) within
magnetized iron plates, aims to resolve neutrino mass hierarchy and precisely
measure $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$, potentially revealing new physics.
The study advances RPC development through simulation techniques. A
straight-line model calculates space charge effects during avalanche or
streamer processes, improving electric field estimation speed and accuracy.
Polarization effects in dielectric electrodes are analyzed, elucidating
electric field dependence on electrode parameters. A new class, pAvalancheMC,
integrated into Garfield++ software, combines straight-line and image charge
models to simulate space charge effects. Using OpenMP for parallel computing,
it achieves significant speed-ups in electron-ion pair generation and space
charge field calculations. Practically, an eight-RPC stack was developed at
VECC to measure cosmic muon scattering angles in high-density materials. A
testbench evaluates efficiency, crosstalk, and hit uniformity. A reconstruction
algorithm, validated with data from the IICHEP stack in Madurai, supports the
VECC stack's potential. This work enhances neutrino physics understanding and
advances RPC-based detection technologies.

TL;DR: 论文分析了3D打印和CNC加工制造恒星器线圈的偏差，发现CNC加工的精度更高，磁场精度和组装过程更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恒星器线圈制造复杂且精度要求高，小规模实验可快速验证设计方法，降低成本。

Method: 通过3D扫描测量制造偏差，用高斯过程建模提取特征长度，并进行磁场精度统计分析。

Result: CNC加工的偏差比3D打印低近一个数量级，磁场精度更高。

Conclusion: CNC加工更适合制造高精度恒星器线圈，提升磁场精度和组装效率。

Abstract: Stellarator coils are known for their complexity and departure from
planarity, along with tight manufacturing tolerances in order to achieve the
target magnetic field accuracy. These requirements can lead to increased costs
and delays in assembly; failure to meet them can compromise the stellarator's
performance. Small-scale experiments offer opportunities to develop and
benchmark stellarator coil design and evaluation methods more quickly and at
lower budget. In this work, we analyze precise 3D scans of the manufacturing
deviations of two 3D-printed coil frames (steel, Ti alloy) and one CNC-machined
coil frame (Al alloy), as part of assessing these approaches to fabricating
high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils for a tabletop stellarator. The
deviations are measured along the coil length, then modeled using Gaussian
processes to extract characteristic length scales. Finally a statistical study
of field accuracy is performed using relevant experimental parameters. We
conclude that the manufacturing perturbations along the winding path from
CNC-machining are almost an order of magnitude lower than those from Additive
Manufacturing. Together with high overall fabrication accuracy, this allows for
higher magnetic field precision and an improved assembly process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的新型超新星分类模型ABC-SN，优于现有工具DASH，并探讨了数据集标签噪声对分类性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光谱分类工具依赖人工监督，现有深度学习分类器如DASH和SNIascore存在维护不足或功能局限的问题，需要更通用的分类方法。

Method: 探索了多种神经网络架构，最终采用注意力机制模型ABC-SN，并在包含10种超新星亚型的数据集上进行测试。

Result: ABC-SN性能优于DASH，但所有分类器的性能可能受数据集标签噪声的限制。

Conclusion: ABC-SN为超新星分类提供了更先进的工具，同时指出数据集质量对分类性能的重要性。

Abstract: While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead
of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night
that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will
discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine
most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template
matching techniques (Blondin & Tonry 2007) and require significant human
supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al.
2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but
SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN
Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work
suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test
sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create
a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an
attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an
updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date
general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes
including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that
ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra
datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于分散式射电干涉成像重建的框架，通过空间频率并行化处理大规模数据，显著提高了重建速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型射电望远镜（如SKA项目）产生的大规模数据处理问题，需要可扩展的软件流水线。

Method: 提出一种框架，通过利用局部可见性和其他节点的重建图像，为每个节点创建伪全分辨率问题，实现并行化。

Result: 在多尺度CLEAN和稀疏正则化凸重建中，框架显著提高了重建速度，尤其在大型数据集上接近最优的2倍加速。

Conclusion: 该并行化框架在保持图像质量的同时，显著提升了处理效率，适用于大规模射电干涉成像。

Abstract: The advent of large aperture arrays, such as the ones currently under
construction for the SKA project, allows for observing the Universe in the
radio-spectrum at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. To process the
enormous amounts of data produced by these telescopes, scalable software
pipelines are required. This paper helps address this by proposing a framework
that allows for decentralized radio-interferometric image reconstruction,
parallelizing by spatial frequency. This is achieved by creating
pseudo-full-resolution problems for each node by using the local visibilities
together with previous major cycle reconstructed images from the other nodes.
We apply the proposed framework to both multiscale CLEAN and sparsity
regularized convex reconstruction and compare them to their serial counterparts
across four different data sets of varying properties in the context of two
visibility partitions. We found that the parallelization framework allows for
significantly improved reconstruction times for images of similar quality. This
was especially the case for our larger datasets where we were able to achieve
close to the optimal $2\times$ speedup.

Method: 研究两种腔间距etalon的温度行为，实验验证其稳定性。

Result: 系统温度稳定性达0.8 mK，校准性能优于ThAr。

Conclusion: 金属涂层etalon提供低成本宽带解决方案，但需长期监测验证稳定性。

Abstract: Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic
measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g.,
ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\'erot
etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for
precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due
to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of
alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the
feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica
etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the
behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with
temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a
temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf
dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift
measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of
providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift
measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm.
A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\'erot etalons, and
although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers
a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging
relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term
monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.

Conclusion: MAGIC望远镜的观测成果推动了极高能伽马射线天体物理学的发展，并为暗物质、量子引力等基础物理问题提供了重要约束。

Abstract: The MAGIC telescopes, located at Observatorio El Roque de los Muchachos (La
Palma, Spain) are two Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes observing the Very High
Energy (VHE) gamma rays. They are run by an international collaboration
composed of over 40 institutions from 12 countries. The first telescope was
inaugurated in October 2003. The commissioning of the second finished in 2008.
The MAGIC telescopes were designed to lower the energies to which ground based
telescopes had access as well as to be able to point to any direction in the
sky in less than 25 seconds. The former required the large reflective surface
of 17 meters as well as an effort to optimise the mirror reflectivity and photo
sensor sensitivity. The latter was achieved by minimising the weight of the
full instrument using for instance carbon fibre reinforced plastic tubes for
the mirror frame. The sensitivity of the MAGIC telescopes have been improving
over the years thanks to hardware upgrades as well as new analysis techniques,
which allowed the collaboration to keep a rich scientific program. The
discovery of VHE emission from Gamma Ray Bursts and pulsars have called for a
revision of the models that explain the production of gamma rays there. Both
the observation of sources in flaring state as well as a systematic monitoring
of sources have provided valuable data to better understand astrophysical
sources both in our Galaxy and outside it. Relevant constraints on fundamental
quantities like dark matter cross-section, quantum gravity scale and density of
extragalactic background light have also been extracted from the observations.

Abstract: Modern large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations require robust tools
capable of analysing their data outputs in a parallel and efficient manner. We
introduce SOAP (Spherical Overdensity and Aperture Processor), a Python package
designed to compute halo and galaxy properties from SWIFT simulations after
being post-processed with a subhalo finder. SOAP takes a subhalo catalogue as
input and calculates a wide array of properties for each object. SOAP offers
parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large
datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo
finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical
overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse
observational comparisons. The package is compatible with both dark matter-only
and full hydrodynamic simulations, producing HDF5 catalogues that are
integrated with the swiftsimio package for seamless unit handling.

Abstract: The Ricochet experiment aims to measure the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering process from antineutrinos emitted by a research nuclear reactor
operated by the Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France). This article
presents a description of the Ricochet experimental installation and the
detector performance achieved during its commissioning with a mini-CryoCube
module consisting of three 42-gram germanium cryogenic calorimeters. The
baseline resolutions and background levels are reported both during reactor-on
and reactor-off periods, and as noise mitigation techniques were improved. A
baseline resolution of 40 eV electron equivalent was achieved for the
ionization channel after setup improvements, and the phonon channel resolutions
ranged from 50 to 80 eV of total phonon energy. In the energy region from 2 to
7 keV, a nuclear recoil rate of 15(2) events/(kg day keV) is measured during
the reactor-off period selecting events in coincidence with muon veto signals.
This rate is in agreement with the cosmogenic neutron rate calculated from
GEANT4 simulations. After the rejection of events in coincidence with signals
in the muon veto detectors, a combined 90% C.L. limit on the nuclear recoil
background of < 9 events/(kg day keV) is obtained in that energy region during
the reactor-on period, which is compatible with our GEANT4 model calculation
corresponding to a total rate of 5 events/(kg day keV). The sensitivity of this
analysis was however found to be limited by a surface event contamination which
is currently being addressed by the Ricochet Collaboration with upgraded
detectors.
