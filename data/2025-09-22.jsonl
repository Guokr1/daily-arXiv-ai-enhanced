Also, the analysis is further tested to timelike geodesics, where we\ninvestigate the motion of massive particles and determine the innermost stable\ncircular orbits. In this case, we discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the\nsystem, show the effects of Rastall gravity, strings, and quintessence on the\nBHs stability and thermal characteristics. In this context, our results improve\nand show of how modifications to general relativity and surrounding matter\ndistributions influence both the dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of BHs."}

In this paper, we present a novel approach\nto determine the isomeric lifetime based on the survival time of ions obtained\nfrom IMS. The survival lifetimes of the ground and isomeric states of 94Ru44+\nwere measured to be s and s in the laboratory, respectively. Given that the\nground state of 94Ru44+ has a natural lifetime of approximately 75 min, its\nsurvival lifetime in the experimental setup was predominantly determined by the\nbeam-loss lifetime, including interactions with residual gas in the storage\nring and carbon foil of the detector. In contrast, the survival lifetime of\n94mRu44+ was governed by its intrinsic nuclear lifetime and additional\nbeam-loss effects. The nuclear decay lifetime of 94mRu44+ was extracted through\ndifferential survival lifetime analysis between ground and isomeric states,\nunder the assumption that the beam-loss lifetimes for both quantum systems are\nidentical. Using this novel methodology, the lifetime measured in the\nlaboratory frame was s. After relativistic time-dilation corrections, the\ncorresponding rest-frame half-life was calculated to be s.

Our results\nshow that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real\nand imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole\nnumbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the\ncorrespondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB\nresults with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across\nall field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate\nwithin a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of\nnear-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and\nHawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications\nof black hole spacetimes."}

The Euler--Heisenberg corrections, which represent nonlinear\nelectrodynamical effects due to vacuum polarization, modify the effective\npotential barrier surrounding the black hole and thereby affect the\ntransmission probabilities for Hawking quanta. Using the sixth-order WKB\nmethod, and verifying our results against the recently proposed correspondence\nbetween grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, we compute the\nfrequency-dependent grey-body spectra for various values of the black hole\ncharge and EEH coupling. We find that the nonlinear coupling systematically\nlowers the effective potential barrier, enhancing the transmission probability.\nThis work represents the first step toward incorporating nonlinear QED effects\ninto the study of Hawking evaporation, focusing here on neutral test fields."}

We illustrate the working principle\nof the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources,\nboth of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection\nrange of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave\ndetection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with\ncurrent technology."}
