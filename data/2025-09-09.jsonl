The damping rate $1/\\tau$ of each quasi-radial mode divided by its\nfrequency $\\sigma^{(0)}$ is given by ${(1/\\tau) / \\sigma^{(0)} }= \\beta\n(\\sigma^{(0)})^3 \\Omega^4 R^8/M \\;, $where $\\Omega$, $R$ and $M$ are the\nangular velocity, radius and mass of the star, and $\\beta$ is a dimensionless\nnumber that depends on the mode, on relativistic corrections, and on the\nstructure of the star, and is typically of order unity for the fundamental\nquasi-radial mode in the nonrelativistic limit. In this paper we develop\nequations and an algorithm for computing the emitted waves and the resulting\ndamping factor $\\beta$.

Time-frequency (wavelet) methods can\nefficiently handle non-stationary noise, but data gaps still lead to spectral\nleakage due to the finite length of the wavelet filters. It was previously\nshown that Bayesian data augmentation - \"gap filling\" - could mitigate spectral\nleakage in frequency domain analyses, but the computational cost associated\nwith the matrix operations needed in that approach is prohibitive. Here we\npresent a new, computationally efficient approach to Bayesian data augmentation\nin the time-frequency domain that avoids repeated, costly matrix operations.

This work presents experimental data for\ntrends in crosstalk probability with temperature and overvoltage for two\ndifferent SiPM devices, and demonstrates a novel method for identifying the\nsource mechanisms of crosstalk avalanches. This is done by using measurements\nof avalanche triggering probabilities for different charge carrier types to\nidentify the device regions in which crosstalk avalanches are produced. This is\npossible because crosstalk photons absorbed in n-doped regions will produce\nhole-triggered avalanches, and those absorbed in p-doped regions will produce\nelectron-triggered avalanches. Thus crosstalk probability can be related to\ndevice structure to assess the effectiveness of existing crosstalk mitigation\nmethods. We identify optical reflections from the device surface as a\nsignificant source of crosstalk, likely to dominate in devices with effective\ncrosstalk mitigation in bulk. Lastly, a diagnostic technique is presented to\nidentify and reduce crosstalk in novel SiPM structures."}

To address this issue, we have built a Convolutional\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN) that reduces parameter count and enhances\ninterpretability, and propose a novel analytical framework to understand the\nnetwork's decision-making process. With this framework, we leverage our network\nto qualitatively assess the offset between the dark matter distribution center\nand the galaxy cluster center, as well as the size of heating regions in\ndifferent models. These findings are consistent with current theoretical\npredictions and show the reliability and interpretability of our network. By\ncombining network interpretability with unseen test results, we also estimate\nthat for SIDM in galaxy clusters, the minimum cross-section\n$(\\sigma/m)_{\\mathrm{th}}$ required to reliably identify its collisional nature\nfalls between $0.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$ and\n$0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$. Moreover, CKAN maintains robust performance\nunder simulated JWST and Euclid noise, highlighting its promise for application\nto forthcoming observational surveys."}

However, the\nwidely used Voronoi-binning method and its variants suffer from two key\nlimitations: they scale poorly with data size, often as O(N^2), creating a\ncomputational bottleneck for modern surveys, and they can produce undesirable\nnon-convex or disconnected bins. I introduce PowerBin, a new algorithm that\novercomes these issues. I frame the binning problem within the theory of\noptimal transport, for which the solution is a Centroidal Power Diagram (CPD),\nguaranteeing convex bins. Instead of formal CPD solvers, which are unstable\nwith real data, I develop a fast and robust heuristic based on a physical\nanalogy of packed soap bubbles. This method reliably enforces capacity\nconstraints even for non-additive measures like S/N with correlated noise. I\nalso present a new bin-accretion algorithm with O(N log N) complexity, removing\nthe previous bottleneck. The combined PowerBin algorithm scales as O(N log N),\nmaking it about two orders of magnitude faster than previous methods on\nmillion-pixel datasets. I demonstrate its performance on a range of simulated\nand real data, showing it produces high-quality, convex tessellations with\nexcellent S/N uniformity.
