Conclusion: 晶体取向效应的研究为开发新型量能器提供了可能，适用于加速器固定靶实验和卫星伽马射线观测站。

Abstract: Although inorganic scintillators are widely used in the design of
electromagnetic calorimeters for high-energy physics and astrophysics, their
crystalline nature and, hence, their lattice orientation are generally
neglected in the detector design. However, in general, the features of the
electromagnetic field experienced by the particles impinging on a crystal at a
small angle with respect to a lattice axis affect their interaction mechanisms.
In particular, in case of electrons/photons of $\mathcal{O} (10~\mathrm{GeV})$
or higher impinging on a high-$Z$ crystal at an angle of $\lesssim
1~\mathrm{mrad}$, the so-called strong field regime is attained: the
bremsstrahlung and pair production cross sections are enhanced with respect to
the case of amorphous or randomly oriented materials. Overall, the increase of
these processes leads to an acceleration of the electromagnetic shower
development. These effects are thoroughly investigated by the OREO (ORiEnted
calOrimeter) team, and pave the way to the development of innovative
calorimeters with a higher energy resolution, a higher efficiency in photon
detection and an improved particle identification capabilities due to the
relative boost of the electromagnetic interactions with respect to the hadronic
ones. Moreover, a detector with the same resolution as the current state of the
art and reduced thickness could be developed. An overview of the lattice
effects at the foundation of the shower boost and of the current status of the
development of an operational calorimeter prototype are presented. This concept
could prove pivotal for both accelerator fixed-target experiments and
satellite-borne $\gamma$-ray observatories.

TL;DR: 介绍了用于全视野荧光光谱X射线成像（3FI）的3FI ASIC设计与评估，该芯片采用65 nm CMOS工艺，具有32x32像素阵列，支持高速多元素X射线荧光成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统X射线荧光显微镜（XFM）需要机械扫描的限制，提供无帧数据采集，实现高通量操作。

Method: 开发了一种65 nm CMOS工艺的ASIC，每个像素包含电荷敏感放大器、整形滤波器、鉴别器等，支持事件驱动读出模式。

Result: 在8.04 keV和3.69 keV下分别实现了308 eV和138 eV的能量分辨率，适用于生物和环境研究中的微量元素分析。

Conclusion: 3FI ASIC在生物和环境研究中具有广泛应用潜力，如营养循环、微生物氧化还原过程等，未来可通过编码孔径等技术进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application
specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar,
two-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed
for Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale
prototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100
{\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel
incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak
detector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing
signal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode,
outputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed
multi-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\mu}W
per pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308
eV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that
corresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy
resolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\alpha}
lines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector
enables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental
research. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence
Microscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering
frame-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI
ASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the
(mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype
correlations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced
spatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt,
extending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.

Abstract: We present a simulation-based study of a compact directional neutron detector
composed of liquid scintillator, Cesium Iodide, with boron carbide (B4C)
moderation, and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using GEANT4, we explored
multiple detector geometries and material configurations, finding neutron
detection efficiencies ranging from approximately 10% to 30%. To evaluate
directionality, spatial energy distributions were analyzed and used to train a
machine learning classifier, which achieved 100% accuracy in identifying
neutron source directions along four cardinal axes. The model remained
effective for sources near detector edges, demonstrating robustness. These
results establish the feasibility of the proposed detector for applications in
nuclear safety, environmental monitoring, and scientific research applications,
with future work focused on experimental validation.

Conclusion: 该探测器设计紧凑、性能高效，适合放射性同位素识别的实际应用。

Abstract: We present a Virtual Frisch-Grid geometry-based CZT gamma detector developed
for identifying different radioisotopes over an energy range from single keV up
to 2 MeV, and useful for efficient characterization of CZT crystals. The
detector is built with a 3 x 3 matrix of CZT crystals, each measuring
approximately 6 mm x 6 mm x 15 mm. The charge generated within the sensor's
active volume is read out via an anode connected directly to the AVG3_Dev
integrated circuit. A current signal induced by charge drift is collected on
side pads of the crystals, enabling reconstruction of a 3D interaction
position. This paper discusses the design, development, and performance of the
standalone, mobile detector system, which integrates the AVG3_Dev readout IC
developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory, high-speed FPGA-based with
per-channel digital signal processing, and embedded system capabilities. The
device is compact, battery-powered, and supports wireless data streaming,
making it suitable for field operations towards radioisotope identification.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度最优控制框架，用于爱因斯坦望远镜中的主动地震隔离，通过联合优化反馈和混合滤波器，显著降低了低频振动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为第三代引力波观测站爱因斯坦望远镜设计高效的主动地震隔离系统，以应对不同传感器配置和环境条件的变化。

Method: 采用基于“非因果最优”的统一成本函数，联合优化反馈和混合滤波器，适用于交叉耦合的光机械系统。

Result: 在OmniSens系统中实现了低频隔离的显著提升，平台运动在微震附近降低了两个数量级。

Conclusion: 该框架为爱因斯坦望远镜的设计提供了有效的优化工具，能够快速适应不同传感器配置和环境条件。

Abstract: We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic
isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave
observatory. Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a
cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the
"acausal optimum," which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across
frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor
configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two
candidate sensing systems: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation
system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial
tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior
low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two
orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready
optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the
performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.

TL;DR: 研究了10个Ge光探测器在NTL信号放大下的性能，验证了其在CUPID探测器结构中的背景抑制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实现无中微子双β衰变的低温探测器实验（如CROSS、BINGO和CUPID），需要验证光探测器的性能。

Method: 使用CROSS机械结构组装探测器，并在西班牙Canfranc地下实验室的脉冲管低温恒温器中运行。

Result: 在80V偏压下，信号噪声比增益约为9，基线噪声RMS为O(10 eV)，时间响应降至约0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: NTL技术为CUPID提供了可行的背景抑制解决方案。

Abstract: As a step towards the realization of cryogenic-detector experiments to search
for neutrinoless double-beta decay (such as CROSS, BINGO, and CUPID), we
investigated a batch of 10 Ge light detectors (LDs) assisted by
Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) signal amplification. Each LD was assembled with a
large cubic light-emitting crystal (45 mm side) using the recently developed
CROSS mechanical structure. The detector array was operated at milli-Kelvin
temperatures in a pulse-tube cryostat at the Canfranc underground laboratory in
Spain. We achieved good performance with scintillating bolometers from CROSS,
made of Li$_{2}$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals and used as reference detectors of the
setup, and with all LDs tested (except for a single device that encountered an
electronics issue). No leakage current was observed for 8 LDs with an electrode
bias up to 100 V. Operating the LDs at an 80 V electrode bias applied in
parallel, we obtained a gain of around 9 in the signal-to-noise ratio of these
devices, allowing us to achieve a baseline noise RMS of $O$(10 eV). Thanks to
the strong current polarization of the temperature sensors, the time response
of the devices was reduced to around half a millisecond in rise time. The
achieved performance of the LDs was extrapolated via simulations of pile-up
rejection capability for several configurations of the CUPID detector
structure. Despite the sub-optimal noise conditions of the LDs (particularly at
high frequencies), we demonstrated that the NTL technology provides a viable
solution for background reduction in CUPID.

Abstract: A light guide is an essential part of many scintillator counters and light

scintillator which has high light transmission while converting the area of the
light source to the shape of a photo-detector. We propose a variation of the
light guide which avoids a 90$\rm ^o$ twist of the strips, reduces the length
of the light pipe, and reduces the complexity of production. Detailed Monte
Carlo simulation studies have been performed for a 3-strip S-shaped light-guide
system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在机械工程和材料科学中的应用潜力，重点关注其在材料知识生成中的表现，并提出了一个材料知识基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在科学领域（如材料科学）中的应用价值，特别是其生成准确材料信息的能力，以弥补互联网中非科学内容的不足。

Method: 以元素周期表为例，分析词汇和标记化对材料指纹唯一性的影响，评估不同开源LLMs生成事实正确输出的能力。

Result: 提出了一个材料知识基准，明确了LLMs在PSPP链中适用的步骤，并指出需要专门模型的领域。

Conclusion: LLMs在材料科学中具有应用潜力，但需结合专门模型以弥补其在科学内容生成中的不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of
mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish
connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for
step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain
of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately
representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet.
However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be
applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for
their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information
about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of
Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the
uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating
factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads
to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in
the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.

Abstract: Acoustic black hole (ABH) structure has been extensively employed in
applications such as vibration mitigation, noise reduction, and energy
harvesting, owing to its unique sound wave trapping and energy concentration
effects. Furthermore, ABH structure shows significant promise in improving the
performance of ultrasonic device and constructing multifunc-tional acoustic
field. Therefore, this paper proposes an ultrasonic mode-conversion transducer
consisting of a Langevin transducer and an ABH wedge radiant plate to
investigate the potential applications of ABH in ultrasonic levitation and
multifunctional particle manipulation. The theoretical model of flexural
vibration of the radiant plate is established by utilizing Timoshenko beam
theory and transfer matrix method, and the calculated vibration frequencies
demonstrated good agreement with those obtained from finite element simulations
(FES). The electrical impedance frequency response characteristics, vibration
modes and the near-field sound pressure distribution of the transducer in air
were also simulated. The results revealed that the amplitude of the ABH wedge
radiant plate increases stepwise, and the sound pressure exhibits a gradient
distribution. A prototype of the transducer was fabricated and experimentally
tested, confirming the accuracy of FES and the feasibility of the design
approach. Finally, the ultrasonic levitation experiment demonstrated that the
ABH design enables the formation of gradient distribution of sound pressure in
the standing wave sound field, thereby facilitating precise particle sorting.

Abstract: The sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) to
terahertz (THz) radiation has been shown to improve continuously with
decreasing temperature. In this work, we first present a quantitative
evaluation of the temperature-dependent noise-equivalent power (NEP) of
recently developed patch-antenna-coupled TeraFET detectors resonant at 540 GHz,
with measurements down to 20 K. Based on these results, we project NEP values
approaching 1 to 2 pW/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ under efficient power
coupling-comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting niobium transition-edge
sensors (TESs) operated at 4 K. Building on these findings in the sub-1 THz
range, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) TeraFET power
detection system for spectroscopy applications was realized. The system
incorporates an 8$\times$8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a
commercial 65 nm Si-CMOS process, optimized for operation in the 2.85- to 3.4
THz band, where fast, sensitive and spectrally specific detectors that do not
require helium cooling remain scarce. Final system characterization was
performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering
approximately 2 mW of optical power. An experimental linear dynamic range
exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1 Hz-detection bandwidth).
The system provides a -3 dB detection bandwidth of 5 MHz vastly exceeding that
of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1-kHz), thus potentially enabling
advanced applications such as time-resolved THz spectroscopy down to the
sub-$\mu$s scale. Combined with its broad temperature operability and compact
design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and
payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions,
where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.

Conclusion: 模型在结构有限元模拟中表现出良好的数值适用性，为非线性弹塑性行为提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We propose a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, for which a specific class of
hyperbolic elasticity arises as a straight consequence of the yield criterion
invariance on the plasticity level. We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or
hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule.
Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical
force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the
stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between
Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and
Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard
tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the
suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to
dilatancy saturation observed during cyclic loading in the triaxial compression
test. We conclude this study with structural finite element simulations that
clearly demonstrate the numerical applicability of the proposed model.

TL;DR: AstroWISP是一套图像处理工具，专为带有拜耳掩模的探测器（如消费级DSLR相机）设计，用于源提取、背景确定、点扩散函数拟合和孔径测光，旨在实现高精度测光并支持更广泛的研究参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费级DSLR相机因拜耳掩模的存在，现有工具难以处理，导致其在高精度测光中未被充分利用。AstroWISP旨在解决这一问题，推动高精度测光的普及。

Method: 开发了一套针对拜耳掩模探测器的图像处理工具，包括源提取、背景确定、点扩散函数拟合和孔径测光等功能。

Result: 工具能够从这类图像中实现高精度测光，可用于检测系外行星凌日现象。

Conclusion: AstroWISP为业余天文学家提供了易用的工具，支持更广泛的研究参与，推动了高精度测光的民主化。

Abstract: We present AstroWISP: a collection of image processing tools for source
extraction, background determination, point spread function/pixel response
function fitting, and aperture photometry. AstroWISP is particularly
well-suited for working with detectors featuring a Bayer mask (an array of
microfilters applied to each detector pixel to allow color photography), such
as consumer DSLR cameras. Such detectors pose significant challenges for
existing tools while offering a much cheaper alternative to specialized
devices. As a result, consumer DSLR cameras with Bayer masks are often
underutilized for precision photometry. \astrowisp{} addresses this limitation
in an effort to democratize precision photometry and support broader community
participation in research. We demonstrate that our tools produce high-precision
photometry from such images, enabling the use of such devices for detecting
exoplanet transits. We package our tools for all major operating systems to
ensure accessibility for amateur astronomers.

Conclusion: 下一代设备Pollux @ HWO将开启高质量恒星磁场研究的新时代，对天体物理学多个领域产生深远影响。

Abstract: High-mass stars are notable for several reasons: they are characterized by
strong winds, which inject momentum and enriched material into their
surroundings, and die spectacularly as supernovae, leaving behind compact
remnants and heavy elements (such as those that make life on Earth possible).
Despite their relative rarity, they play a disproportionate role in the
evolution of the galaxies that host them, and likely also played a significant
role in the early days of the Universe. A subset ($\sim$10\%) of these stars
was also found to host magnetic fields on their surface. These fields impact
their evolution, and may lead to exotic physics (e.g., heavy stellar-mass black
holes, pair-instability supernovae, magnetars, etc.). However, the detection
and measurement of magnetic fields is limited, due to current instrumentation,
to nearby massive stars in the Milky Way. To truly understand how magnetism
arises in massive stars, and what role it might have played in earlier stages
of our Universe, we require next-generation hardware, such as the proposed
near-infrared-to-ultraviolet spectropolarimeter Pollux, on the Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO). In this contribution, we detail how Pollux @ HWO will enable
new frontiers in the study of magnetic massive stars, delivering results that
will profoundly impact the fields of stellar formation, stellar evolution,
compact objects, and stellar feedback.

Abstract: Human activities degrade the Earth environment at an unprecedented scale and
pace, threatening Earth-system stability, resilience and life-support
functions. We can of course deny the facts, get angry about them, try to
bargain, or fall into deep depression. Or we may overcome these stages of grief
and move towards accepting that human activities need to change, including our
own ones. The purpose of this paper is to support astronomers in this
transition, by providing insights into the origins of environmental impacts in
astronomical research and proposing changes that would make the field
sustainable. The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of research
infrastructures, since these are the dominant sources of greenhouse gas
emissions in astronomy, acknowledging that impact reductions in other areas,
for example professional air travelling, need also to be achieved.

Conclusion: 更新数据为氢富集等离子体建模提供了更准确的输入。

Abstract: Context. Molecular hydrogen and its cation H+2 are among the first species
formed in the early Universe, and play a key role in the thermal and chemical
evolution of the primordial gas. In molecular clouds, H+2 ions formed through
ionization of H2 by particles react rapidly with H2 to form H+3 , triggering
the formation of almost all detected interstellar molecules. Aims. We present a
new set of cross sections and rate coefficients for state-to-state
ro-vibrational transitions of the H+2 and HD+ ions, induced by low-energy
electron collisions. Study includes the major electron-impact processes
relevant for low-metallicity astrochemistry: inelastic and superelastic
scattering, and dissociative recombination. Methods. The electron-induced
processes involving H+2 and HD+ are treated using the multichannel quantum
defect theory. Results. The newly calculated thermal rate coefficients show
significant differences compared to those used in previous studies. When
introduced into astrochemical models, particularly for shock-induced chemistry
in metal-free gas, the updated dissociative recombination rates produce
substantial changes in the predicted molecular abundances. Conclusions. These
data provide updated and improved input for the modeling of hydrogen-rich
plasmas in environments

Abstract: The dawning of the Space Age marked the start of an ongoing relationship
between the professional astronomical community and both state and non-state
actors that launch and operate spacecraft in near-Earth orbital space. While
the Cold War heated up in the late 1950s, military uses of outer space quickly
came into conflict with the priorities of astronomers then building ever-bigger
ground-based telescopes and envisioning the first generation of space
telescopes. As the threat of global thermonuclear war loomed, the United States
carried out Project West Ford, which tested an 'artificial ionosphere' for
microwave radio propagation by placing several hundred million tiny copper
dipoles into a belt orbiting the Earth. While the test was ultimately
successful, it ignited a firestorm of concern and criticism among astronomers
and ultimately influenced the framing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty.
Here we examine the history of Project West Ford as it prompted astronomers to
react, comparing it with the ongoing problem of the potential impact of large
satellite constellations on astronomical research.

Result: 量化了物理构造器对能量沉积的影响，并比较了其计算性能。

Conclusion: 研究为使用CaWO₄和Ge目标的实验提供了物理构造器选择的依据。

Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for
rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g.
the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless
double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable
background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to
construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of
how to model the physics of particle interactions. For example, for
electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of models:
physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute
to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics
constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy
deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics
constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_\mathrm{4}$
and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for
several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly
encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$
particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We
also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.

Conclusion: 当前方法性能有限，未来需扩展训练数据和改进分类策略以提高准确性。

Abstract: The increasing field of view of radio telescopes and improved data processing
capabilities have led to a surge in the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).
The discovery rate of FRBs is already a few per day and is expected to increase
rapidly with new surveys coming online. The growing number of events
necessitates prioritized follow-up due to limited multi-wavelength resources,
requiring rapid and automated classification. In this study, we introduce
Frabjous, a deep learning framework for an automated morphology classifier with
an aim towards enabling the prompt follow-up of anomalous and intriguing FRBs,
and a comprehensive statistical analysis of FRB morphologies. Deep learning
models require a large training set of each FRB archetype, however, publicly
available data lacks sufficient samples for most FRB types. In this paper, we
build a simulation framework for generating realistic examples of FRBs and
train a network based on a combination of simulated and real data, starting
with the CHIME/FRB catalog. Applying our framework to the first CHIME/FRB
catalog, we achieve an overall classification accuracy of approximately 55%,
well over a random multiclass classification rate of 20 % with five balanced
classes during training. While this falls short of desirable performance, we
critically discuss the limitations of our approach and propose potential
avenues for improvement. Future work should explore strategies to augment
training datasets and broaden the scope of FRB morphological studies, aiming
for more accurate and reliable classification results.

Abstract: As part of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 and under the guidance of the Royal
Commission for AlUla (RCU), efforts are underway to establish AlUla Manara as
the Kingdom first major astronomical observatory. This study presents a
preliminary assessment of the site based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data to
evaluate its suitability for hosting a 4m-class optical-IR telescope. AlUla
Manara is located on a remote plateau 74 km north of the historical town of
AlUla and was recently designated as an International Dark Sky Park. The
analysis focuses on key astro-meteorological parameters such as seeing,
temperature regimes, wind patterns, cloud cover and precipitable water vapor
(PWV). Results show a median nighttime seeing of 1.5 arcsec, a median cold
season PWV of 3.2 mm, and over 79% of nighttime hours with clear sky
conditions. Wind regimes are generally mild, posing no constraints on
infrastructure. The analysis includes three further sites in the Kingdom,
namely Volcanic Top, Ward Mountain, and Dubba Mountain. These sites exhibit
better turbulence conditions, but are located outside RCU jurisdiction.
Nevertheless, AlUla Manara remains a competitive candidate thanks to its
alignment with broader regional development goals. To validate these
preliminary results, a dedicated Astronomical Site Monitor has been deployed on
site to support the design and operational planning of the observatory.

Abstract: The detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is one
of the most challenging tasks for both current and next-generation detectors.
Successfully distinguishing the SGWB from instrumental noise and environmental
effects requires accurate and flexible analysis tools capable of detecting the
signal and determining its origin. In this paper, we introduce a unified
framework and a user-friendly tool for SGWB characterization: \texttt{GWBird}
(Gravitational Wave Background Inventory of Response functions for Detectors).
This code enables the computation of overlap reduction functions (ORFs),
power-law integrated sensitivity curves (PLS), angular response functions, and
angular PLS (APLS). It supports the full range of gravitational wave
polarization modes (tensor, scalar, and vector), allowing for the
characterization of both isotropic and anisotropic SGWB components for all the
polarizations. Additionally, the code includes functions for circular
polarization characterization, which is particularly relevant for probing
parity-violating signals. The framework integrates analyses for ground-based,
space-based, and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) detectors, offering a versatile
framework for SGWB analysis. The \texttt{GWBird} code is publicly available

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于$f(Q,B)=\delta Q^{2}+\beta B$的修正引力框架的宇宙学动力学，结合Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG)模型，通过MCMC方法拟合观测数据，验证了该模型对宇宙晚期加速膨胀的解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索修正引力框架$f(Q,B)$与MCG模型的结合，以解释宇宙从早期物质行为到晚期加速膨胀的过渡。

Method: 推导Hubble参数$H(z)$的解析表达式，利用MCMC技术结合Hubble参数测量、BAO数据和Pantheon+超新星数据拟合模型参数。

Result: 最佳拟合参数为$H_0 = 72.22^{+3.64}_{-4.46}$，$A_s = 0.696^{+0.082}_{-0.129}$等，宇宙年龄$t_0 \approx 13.53$ Gyr，EoS参数$\omega_0 \approx -0.691$，验证了模型的观测一致性。

Conclusion: $f(Q,B)$引力框架下的MCG模型为宇宙晚期加速膨胀提供了可行的解释，与观测数据一致。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity
framework based on the function $f(Q,B)=\delta Q^{2}+\beta B$, where $Q$
denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ is the boundary term that relates $Q$
to the Ricci scalar. The matter sector is modeled using the Modified Chaplygin
Gas (MCG) with the equation of state $p=A\rho-\frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$,
allowing the model to interpolate between early-time matter behavior and
late-time cosmic acceleration. By deriving an analytical expression for the
Hubble parameter $H(z)$, we perform a parameter estimation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in conjunction with the latest cosmological
observations: $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, $15$ BAO data points, DESI
DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation. The best-fit
values are obtained as $H_0 = 72.22^{+3.64}_{-4.46}$, $A_s =
0.696^{+0.082}_{-0.129}$, $\alpha = 0.0029^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$, and $A =
0.0038^{+0.071}_{-0.047}$. The deceleration parameter transitions at redshift
$z_{tr} \approx 0.946$, while the present-day value is $q_0 = -0.789$. The
model yields an age of the Universe $t_0 \approx 13.53$ Gyr and a present EoS
parameter $\omega_0 \approx -0.691$, which reflects the late-time acceleration
consistent with observational bounds. These results demonstrate that the MCG
scenario within $f(Q,B)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally
consistent framework for explaining the late-time accelerated expansion of the
Universe.

TL;DR: 研究黑洞ISCO的量子特征，发现非热激发谱，为强场引力下的量子真空提供新探测手段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索黑洞ISCO区域的量子特征，以区分不同轨迹观测者的量子现象。

Method: 将原子建模为Unruh-DeWitt探测器，耦合到Boulware真空中的无质量标量场，计算ISCO处探测器的激发率。

Result: 发现离散的“频率梳”非热激发谱，峰值位置由ISCO轨道频率决定，强度随接近ISCO显著增加。

Conclusion: 该光谱特征为强场引力下的量子真空提供了新探测手段，对吸积盘发射光谱的解释有潜在意义。

Abstract: We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit
(ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling
an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the
Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a
circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast
to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling
observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum
characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show
that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at
the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches
this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel
theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime
and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by
observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications
for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues
for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.

Abstract: In this work, we study some characteristics and gravitational signatures of
the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a Hernquist dark matter halo
(SBH-HDM). We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide
useful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the
luminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we
determine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion
disk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the
innermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We
also numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter
into radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly
alters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the
accretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and
spectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in
the eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the
stability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape
from the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes. Finally,
some properties of black holes are studied from a topological perspective.

Conclusion: 结论指出涌现修正引力理论为广义相对论提供了更广泛的修正框架，并展示了其在宇宙学中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Emergent modified gravity has shown that the canonical formulation of general
relativity gives rise to a larger class of covariant modifications than
action-based approaches, so far in symmetry-reduced models. This outcome is
made possible by distinguishing between the space-time metric on a given
solution, and the basic field degrees of freedom in which equations of motion
are formulated. In this general treatment, the metric is no longer fundamental
but emerges after field equations and covariance conditions are solved. Here,
the results are extended to perturbative inhomogeneity on a spatially flat
cosmological background, showing that new modifications are possible while
maintaining the classical derivative order and setting the stage for dynamical
equations suitable for detailed studies of early-universe models.

Conclusion: 旋转和高斯-博内参数在quintessence背景下显著影响黑洞的拓扑数，绕数可通过二阶极点留数计算。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of black hole solutions surrounded by
quintessence as defects possessing topological characteristics within the
thermodynamic space. By formulating a generalized off-shell free energy and
calculating the winding number for each black hole branch through the residues
of isolated first-order poles of characteristic function defined by this free
energy, the winding number reflects the local properties of black holes. The
topological number, being the sum of winding numbers for all black hole
branches, reflects global properties. Utilizing the residue method, we
discovered that the topological numbers for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-AdS
black holes surrounded by quintessence are consistent with those not surrounded
by quintessence. Furthermore, 4D/5D Einstein-Gauss Bonnet black holes under a
quintessence field belong to the same topological class as Kerr black holes.
Thus both the rotation parameter and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in this background
field affect the topological number of the black hole. Importantly, the winding
numbers for generation and annihilation points can be calculated using the
residues of second-order poles of the characteristic function.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子引力态的构造提供了新思路，特别是在AAdS时空中，共形场论的配分函数可能成为有效的量子态候选。

Abstract: The phase space of gravitational theories in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter
(AAdS) spacetimes consists of geometries, matter configurations, and their
conjugate momenta on a Cauchy surface, subject to the Hamiltonian, momentum,
and matter-gauge constraints. When a unique maximal volume slice exists in all
classical solutions of the bulk equations of motion, and the matter fields
satisfy certain conditions, we show that this phase space is physically
equivalent to an alternative phase space in which the Hamiltonian constraint is
replaced by the real Weyl-anomaly constraint, while the momentum and
matter-gauge constraints remain unchanged. A necessary requirement for a
functional of the metric and matter configurations to qualify as a valid
quantum gravity state is that it satisfies the operator gauge constraints.
Partition functions of certain conformal field theories with imaginary central
charge, defined on bulk Cauchy slices, satisfy these operator gauge constraints
and therefore provide candidate quantum gravity states in the alternative phase
space formulation.

Conclusion: 研究证实了Vaidya黑洞图像的时间依赖性，为理解黑洞动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope's 2024 observations report a shift in the
position angle of the brightness asymmetry in M87*, revealing time variability
in the black hole's image. In this analysis, we investigate the time-dependent
of a Vaidya black hole. By introducing a mass function that increases linearly
with time, along with a conformal transformation, we derive the conformal
Vaidya metric and define a new time coordinate $t_c$. Using the semi-analytical
approach, we analyze the ray trajectories and radiation flux of the Vaidya
black hole in the background of a thin accretion disk. We discuss how the
observed flux in the Vaidya spacetime evolves as a function of the new time
coordinate $t_c$. The results show that the facula on the observable plane
undergoes radial displacement as $t_c$ increases, revealing the time-dependent
evolution of black hole images.

Abstract: Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic
non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations,
which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and
pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the
theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the
geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that,
in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the
core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation
occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear
saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below
the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative
quantum chromodynamics.

Result: 磁场与黑洞角动量对齐时，吸积盘辐射与磁场强度正相关；检测阈值为1.0638×10⁻⁹ T。

Conclusion: 研究为通过吸积盘辐射观测未来磁场环境研究提供了关键理论支持。

Abstract: The Novikov-Thorne accretion disk model is widely employed in astrophysics,
yet computing its blackbody spectrum theoretically requires analytical
expressions for the orbital parameters -- specific energy, angular momentum,
and angular velocity -- of the constituent timelike particles, a task extremely
challenging in non-integrable curved spacetimes. In this work, we numerically
obtain these orbital parameters for quasi-Keplerian motion in Kerr spacetime
with an asymptotically uniform magnetic field using iterative,
finite-difference, and interpolation methods, enabling simulations of the
disk's energy flux density, temperature, and blackbody spectra across diverse
spin parameters, observational inclinations, and magnetic field strengths. We
demonstrate that when the magnetic field aligns with the black hole's angular
momentum, the disk's radiation positively correlates with field strength, while
spectral analysis for our specific black hole mass and accretion rate reveals a
conservative detectable threshold of $1.0638 \times 10^{-9}$ T for ambient
magnetic fields. This study not only extends the Novikov-Thorne model to
non-integrable axisymmetric spacetimes but also establishes the first direct
relationship between external magnetic fields and disk properties, providing
critical theoretical support for future magnetic environment studies through
disk radiation observations.

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了文献中的部分稳定性结论，为多维引力理论提供了新见解。

Abstract: We discuss static, spherically symmetric solutions to the 5D Einstein-Maxwell
equations (belonging to wide classes of multidimensional solutions known at
least from the 1990s) and select among them those which must observationally
look like local objects whose surface reflects back particles or signals
getting there, the so-called mirror stars (also called ``topological stars'' by
some authors). Their significant parameters are the Schwarzschild mass $m$ and
the magnetic charge $q$, such that $q^2 > 3m^2$. For comparison, we also
discuss their black hole counterparts for which $q^2 < 3m^2$. For both these
objects, we study spherically symmetric time-dependent perturbations and
determine the stability regions in their parameter spaces. Our stability
results disagree with some of those previously announced in the literature.

Abstract: In this study, we model a spin-network in loop quantum gravity as a regular
tetrahedral lattice, applying lattice physics techniques to study its structure
and vertex dynamics. Using the area eigenvalue, $A\propto 8\pi l_P^2$, we
derive a lattice constant $a = 2.707\,l_P$ and construct a vertex Hamiltonian
incorporating a Lennard-Jones potential, zero-point energy, and simple harmonic
oscillations. A foliation approach enforces the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint via
locally non-zero Hamiltonians that globally cancel. Graviton-like perturbations
(treated here as spin-0 bosons) modify the vertex energy spectrum, with
variational analysis suggesting twelve coherent excitations per vertex. This
model frames flat spacetime as a graviton-rich lattice while enforcing a
Brownian-like stochastic picture for the gravitons, and offers a basis for
extension into curved quantum geometries.

Conclusion: 引力波应变可直接反映磁星近表面磁场，且磁层电流影响较小。

Abstract: The intense magnetic fields inferred from magnetars suggest they may be
strong gravitational-wave emitters. Although emissions due to hydromagnetic
deformations are more promising from a detection standpoint, exterior fields
also contribute a strain. However, numerical evidence suggests that the free
energy of stable magnetospheric solutions cannot exceed a few tens of percent
relative to the potential state, implying that the gravitational-wave
luminosity cannot differ significantly between models. This prompts
`universality', in the sense that the strain provides a direct probe of the
near-surface field without being muddied by magnetospheric currents. Using a
suite of three-dimensional, force-free, general-relativistic solutions for
dipole and dipole-plus-quadrupole fields, we find that space-based
interferometers may enable marginal detections out to $\lesssim$ kpc distances
for slowly-rotating magnetars with fields of $\gtrsim 10^{15}$ G.

Abstract: We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with
gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves
training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then
employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by
gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black
holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time
required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our
approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with
superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate
visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our
findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for
rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to
astronomical visualization.

Abstract: We analyse how different Generalised Uncertainty Principles could place
bounds on the compactness of self-gravitating systems. By considering existing
experimental bounds on the relevant parameters, we conclude that the
compactness of large astrophysical objects is bounded above by the inverse of
the GUP parameter, which would naturally be of order one. Conversely, the
existence of black holes imposes stronger bounds on those parameters.

Abstract: Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact
solutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct
regions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable
wormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy
conditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by
introducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds.
This review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions,
emphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative
theories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of
non-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static
solutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar
fields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter
backgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole
dynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories,
especially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of
traversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not
violate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide
range of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific
geometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently
with the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such
configurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by
general relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper
theoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding
universe.

Conclusion: 强重力环境下，系统的微观自由度对熵的贡献表现为截面积的函数，这一发现为理解强重力下的热力学行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Entropy of matter in a very strong gravity depends on cross-sectional area of
the container of the system -- is being further bolstered by calculating
entropy of a monoatomic gas kept under uniform strong gravity at Newtonian
scale. This bypasses the earlier analysis where existence of horizon is
crucial. Also the extensivity of this entropy has been discussed in the light
of the same of a two-space dimensional ultra-relativistic non-interacting gas
without gravity. The whole analysis, as far as entropy is concerned, indicates
that under strong gravity the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system are
effectively contributed by the cross-sectional area of the system.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of null trajectories and scalar
wave propagation in a $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime containing a spiral
dislocation-a topological defect characterized by torsion in the absence of
curvature. For null rays, the torsion parameter $\beta$ modifies the affine
structure, enforcing a finite turning radius $r_{\min} = \sqrt{b^2 - \beta^2}$
and inducing a torsion-mediated angular deflection that decreases monotonically
with increasing $\beta$. The photon trajectory deviates from the
curvature-induced lensing paradigm, exhibiting a purely topological exclusion
zone around the defect core. In the wave regime, we recast the Helmholtz
equation into a Schr\"odinger-like form and extract a spatially and spectrally
dependent refractive index $n^2(r,k)$. This index asymptotically approaches
unity at large distances, but diverges strongly and negatively near the
dislocation core due to torsion-induced geometric terms. The resulting
refractive index profile governs the transition from propagating to evanescent
wave behavior, with low-frequency modes experiencing pronounced localization
and suppression. Our findings reveal that torsion alone, absent any curvature,
can act as a geometric regulator of both classical and quantum propagation,
inducing effective anisotropy, frequency filtering, and confinement. This
framework provides a rare exact realization of light-matter interaction in a
torsion-dominated background, with potential applications in analog gravity
systems and photonic metamaterials engineered to replicate non-Riemannian
geometries.

Result: TDI对张量模式的约束能力因信号抵消效应而降低，但对额外极化模式的探测能力有所提升，尤其是矢量模式优于标量模式。

Conclusion: 尽管直接探测额外极化模式仍具挑战性，TDI方法能提升其探测能力，且矢量模式的约束改善较小，因其波形与倾角相关。

Abstract: Probing extra polarizations in gravitational waves (GWs) with space-based
detectors is the most direct method for testing theories of gravity. In this
paper, by employing the second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to
cancel out the laser frequency noise in a rotating and flexing configuration
with arm lengths varying linearly in time, we study the detectors' constraint
ability on extra polarizations, and explore the impacts of TDI on the
constraint of polarizations. Working in the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE)
waveform framework, we find that the constraints on extra polarizations are
significantly weaker than those for the tensor mode. For the tensor mode, the
constraint ability for the detectors scales with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
At low frequency, due to signal cancellation effects, the SNR registered is
lower for the detectors with TDI method than that with the simplified equal-arm
Michelson interferometer method. Therefore, tensor-mode constraints are
degraded when TDI is applied. Although the direct detection of extra
polarizations remains challenging, the constraint ability of the space-based
detectors on the vector mode is better than the scalar modes. Besides, the
detectability on extra polarizations will be enhanced with TDI, and the
improvement of the constraint on the vector mode is less than scalar modes due
to the inclination-dependent waveforms.

Abstract: We propose a new, general form for a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential
(PNP), expressed as a series of Paczy\'nski-Wiita-like functions with the
addition of increasing negative powers of $r$ with arbitrary coefficients. We
present a procedure for determining these coefficients to construct a custom
PNP that replicates key features of Schwarzschild geodesics for a test particle
near a black hole. As an example, we construct potentials set to reproduce (I)
the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit at the $r=6$ (geometric
units), with the correct infall velocity for small deviations (on the geodesic
universal infall), (II) the periapsis advance at large distances, and (III) the
presence of a marginally bound circular orbit with specific angular momentum
$L=4$, and the periapsis advance of parabolic orbits close to it. We compare
the performance of our examples against the Paczy\'nski-Wiita potential and
other existing potentials. Finally, we discuss the limitations and advantages
of our formulation.

Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes.
These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform
through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances
involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for
resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass
surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the
accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely
many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth
out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to
the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent
relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as
discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate
resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.

Conclusion: 广义熵暗能量模型在观测数据中表现出良好的拟合性，为哈勃张力问题提供了可能的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new dark energy (DE) model from four parameter generalized
entropy function of apparent horizon in a spatially flat universe. Such kind of
generalized entropy is able to generalize all the known entropies proposed so
far, for suitable representations of the entropic parameters. It turns out that
the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the
sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM
model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of
present Hubble parameter for certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to
a possible resolution of Hubble tension issue. We confront the scenario with
CC, PantheonPlus+SH0ES, DESI DR1 and compressed Planck likelihood datasets,
which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for
some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent
with the resolution of Hubble tension.

Motivation: 探索标量场和奇异物质分布对光线偏转的影响，特别是在修正引力场景中。

Result: 标量场耦合常数适中时增强光线偏转，但过高时在强场区抑制偏转；五重场增强偏转，标量毛发成分则减弱偏转。

Conclusion: 标量场和奇异物质分布在修正引力中显著影响光线传播。

Abstract: We investigate the deflection angle of light rays confined to the equatorial
plane of a Hairy Kiselev black hole. The analysis includes a thorough study of
the horizon structure and critical parameters, leading to an analytic
expression for the deflection angle in terms of elliptic integrals. Our results
confirm that the deflection angle decreases with increasing impact parameter,
in agreement with classical predictions of gravitational lensing. The influence
of the scalar field, characterized by the coupling constant, shows a nontrivial
effect: while moderate values of the coupling constant initially enhance light
bending, further increases lead to a suppression of the deflection in the
strong-field regime due to modifications in spacetime geometry. Comparative
analysis among the Schwarzschild, Kiselev, and Hairy Kiselev black holes
indicates that the presence of a quintessential field tends to enhance the
deflection, whereas the scalar hair component reduces it. These findings
underscore the significant role of scalar fields and exotic matter
distributions in shaping light propagation in a modified gravity scenario.

very high accuracy and a wider frequency range compared with the existing
methods. Our new method is definitely useful for constructing the waveform

Conclusion: BEC系统可模拟黑洞环境，RPs稳定性与模式相关，实验结果可通过散射干涉验证。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the
counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a
two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped
excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term
using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a
perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole
surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical
scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the
orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the
spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also
study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that
the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the
counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone
(fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large)
scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern
in experiments.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in
determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular,
next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate
waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent
NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase
contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar
NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such
as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the
effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and
validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with
numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ
them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both
comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the
gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with
respect to previous analyses.

Motivation: 月球时间计量需要一个独立于地球的统一时间框架，但现有的LTC与TT转换公式的推导和假设存在争议。

Result: 提出了一个独立且通用的月球标准时间框架，并发现坐标时间变换系数具有长期变化特性。

Conclusion: 通过精确的地月时间比较，可以测量和预测坐标时间变换系数的长期变化，为月球时间计量提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Lunar time metrology necessitates a unified temporal framework beyond Earth,
requiring an independent lunar system for timekeeping, dissemination, and
calendrics. Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC)
within relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion
formula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The
complex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing
relationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area
(internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of
physics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal
weighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent
and self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics
retain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a
non-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's
geodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating
references strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an
Earth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general
relativity's locality principle. This work derives the relationship between
coordinate time and proper time. Using the Earth-Moon system as an
intermediary, it obtains a simplified transformation formula between LTC and
TT. An independent and universal lunar standard time framework is proposed.
Crucially, the derived coordinate time transformation coefficient exhibits
long-term secular variation. This variation can be measured and predicted
through precise Earth-Moon time comparisons.

Motivation: 探索Aschenbach效应在静态黑洞中的表现及其在Massive Gravity理论中的适用性，以验证曲率是否足以引发非单调速度分布。

Method: 基于先前研究，分析Massive Gravity理论中的黑洞结构，探讨其引力势极值是否支持Aschenbach现象。

Result: 研究发现，静态黑洞中的几何极值（如稳定光子球）可重现Aschenbach效应，表明曲率本身足以引发类似现象。

Conclusion: Aschenbach效应不仅限于旋转时空，静态黑洞中的曲率极值也能产生类似现象，可能成为广义相对论的可观测特征。

Abstract: The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two
quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime
curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this
non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian
intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity
irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed
that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential,
corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior
in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the
absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through
appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic
velocity profiles.
  In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black
hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the
emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like
phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in
the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect
in rotating spacetimes?

Abstract: We investigate gravitational waveforms from the inspiral phase of compact
binary systems within the framework of quadratic gravity and map their
deviations from general relativity into the parameterized post-Einstein (PPE)
formalism to constrain the theory parameters. Quadratic gravity generically
includes a massive spin-2 ghost, which leads to ill-defined energy and angular
momentum fluxes. Following earlier proposals, we remove these unphysical
features by imposing a constraint on the massive spin-2 mode, restricting it to
propagate only the same polarizations of general relativity. Within the
quadrupole approximation, we derive the radiative degrees of freedom, including
massless and massive tensor modes, as well as a massive scalar field. Using the
stationary phase approximation, we compute the Fourier-domain waveform of the
massless tensor modes and extract the phase corrections. For small deviations
from general relativity, we show that both the scalar and massive tensor modes
can be consistently embedded into the PPE framework, extending previous results
that considered only scalar fields. We derive updated constraints on the
parameters of quadratic gravity, finding bounds improved by three orders of
magnitude compared to existing limits. Finally, we present forecasts for the
sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope to these deviations.

Abstract: Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black
holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave
detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical
environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a
fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of
matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation
expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a
modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then
implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment
through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a
result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of
Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of
the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the
Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles.
Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral,
contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into
the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments.
Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future
computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.

Abstract: Bulk viscous cosmological models is presented in the teleparallel ($F(T)$,
where $T$ denotes torsion) gravity. In the teleparallel gravity, the Lagrangian
of the gravitational action contains a general function $F(T)= T+ f(T)=(1+
\gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$, where $\gamma$, $n$ and $\alpha$ are dimensional
constants. Cosmological solutions in Eckart theory and Truncated Israel Stewart
theory are talked about in $F(T)=(1+ \gamma) T+\alpha (-T)^n$ gravity form
which is one of the most generalized gravity form in the torsional gravity. The
substantial and geometrical prospective of the cosmological models in Eckart
theory and Truncated Israel Stewart theory in $F(T)$ gravity are deliberated
for flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space time. Dynamical analysis of the fixed
points of exponential expansion in $F(T)$ with bulk viscous cosmological models
are studied here. The characteristics of the various cosmological parameters
such as bulk viscous pressure, energy density, scale factor, Hubble parameter
and entropy evolution are studied in Power law and Exponential models.
Stability analysis of the exponential models are also argued with cosmic growth
in the relevant theories by using directional plots. The cosmological models
are supported by observations results.

Abstract: One of the major problems in quantum gravity research is the lack of signals
at the reach of present or near-future experimental facilities. In this paper,
we show that this is not the case. Contrary to previous claims, the quantum
decay of de Sitter space into black hole spacetimes can be significant even
after inflation and can be observed on galactic scales. Using the instanton
formalism within the no-boundary proposal for a class of short-scale,
quantum-gravity-improved black holes, we show that de Sitter space decay would
result in the production of $10^{60}$ stable Planck-size black hole remnants
within the current Hubble horizon, which is the number required to explain dark
matter.

Abstract: We investigate the inflation for the quartic hilltop model via a certain type
of modified gravity. Precisely, we analyze the $F(\phi) T$ term in the
Einstein's gravity to examine the quartic hilltop inflation model. $T$ is the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and $\phi$ is the inflaton field. Next, we
calculate the inflation dynamics for the foregoing model and obtain the
slow-roll parameters, i.e., the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the
tensor-to-scale ratio ``$r$'', which these parameters exhibit high sensitivity
to the $F(\phi) T$ term. This modified form of the gravity is not only in
accordance with the predictions of the original model but also allows for
better prediction of the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.
