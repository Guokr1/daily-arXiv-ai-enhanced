Throughout the third\nobservation run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, we identify 28 BBH events with a\nfalse alarm rate below once per 100 yr; all of which were previously reported\nin the GWTC-3 and 4-OGC catalogs. Additional candidates with false alarm rates\nbetween once per 1 and 100 yr are also reported. We perform an injection\ncampaign to characterize the sensitive volume time of our search pipeline.\nAssuming that none of the eccentric BBH events were missed by previous\nsearches, our results provide constraints on the event rate of eccentric BBHs\nin the mass range [5, 30] $M_\\odot$. For a 30-30 $M_\\odot$ BBH with\neccentricity 0.5, the event rate is limited to less than 0.06 Gpc$^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$; this marks an order of magnitude improvement for sensitive volume\ncompared with the previous search with a minimally modeled algorithm without\nusing templates."}

We examine how the NED charge parameter\ninfluences orbital dynamics by modifying the background spacetime geometry,\nthereby affecting the energy and angular momentum of particles. In particular,\nwe calculate the radii of the marginally bound orbits (MBOs) and innermost\nstable circular orbits (ISCOs), demonstrating that the NED charge parameter\nreduces both radii. This provides valuable insight into the role of the charge\nparameter in shaping orbital behavior and altering spacetime geometry. We model\nthe complex motion of a stellar-mass object, as a timelike particle,\ninspiraling into a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the MCBH background, with\nits trajectory described using periodic geodesic orbits. Based on this analysis\nof such periodic orbits, we further analyze the gravitational waveforms\ngenerated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which the SMBH's\nspacetime dominates the dynamics of the stellar-mass object. By combining\nparticle trajectory analysis with waveform modeling in a semi-analytical, we\nshow that the charge parameter arising from NED significantly alters the\nzoom-whirl orbital dynamics and induces notable changes in the waveform\nstructure. These results illustrate that future gravitational wave (GW)\nobservations may constrain the properties of MCBHs, thereby deepening our\nunderstanding of the gravitational imprint of nonlinear electrodynamics."}

This relation\nis shown to hold universally for asymptotically flat black holes in pure\ngravity, and is generalized to asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes\nthrough appropriate regularization. We further examine its validity in systems\nwith matter-gravity coupling, identifying that violations occur only when\nmatter fields exhibit pathological behaviors: divergence at the horizon or\nnon-decaying profiles at infinity.

A Simpson-Visser-like procedure is applied to reconstruct\nthese regular spacetimes, free of time-like and space-like singularities. Such\na procedure is also applied to describe a regular cosmological expansion, where\nthe universe reaches a minimum scale and then rebounds. This type of regular\nspacetime is achieved by considering some scalar fields as sources, with the\nappropriate kinetic term and scalar potential. We show that all these sources\nturn out to be ghosts due to the wrong sign of the kinetic term. These ghosts\ncan, however, be eliminated by constraints. Nevertheless, the same procedure is\nalso explored in the framework of modified gravities, particularly within the\nso-called f(R) gravity, where a new wormhole spacetime is also obtained that\ndoes not require a ghost scalar field."}
