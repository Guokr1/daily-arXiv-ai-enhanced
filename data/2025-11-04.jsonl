This identification relies on greybody factors as stable\nobservables, despite the apparent spectral instability of quasinormal modes. In\nthis work, by extending the definition of quasi-reflectionless modes to\nreflectionless ones and generalizing symmetric Damour-Solodukhin wormholes to\nasymmetric cases, we examine the underlying similarity between the\nreflectionless and echo mode spectra in the complex frequency plane. Through a\nprimarily analytical treatment, we demonstrate that the asymptotic properties\nof these two spectra exhibit a strong resemblance, featuring an approximately\nuniform distribution parallel to the real frequency axis with the same spacing\nbetween successive modes. Specifically, the real parts of echo modes coincide\nwith those of reflectionless modes at the limit $|\\mathrm{Re}\\omega| \\gg\n|\\mathrm{Im}\\omega|$. While echo modes typically possess non-vanishing\nimaginary parts, the reflectionless modes of symmetric Damour-Solodukhin\nwormholes lie precisely on the real frequency axis, with any deviation serving\nas a measure of the degree of asymmetry of the wormhole. We support our\nderivations by employing two complementary approaches, based on the scattering\nmatrix and the Green's function, and argue that both perspectives provide\neffective tools for describing the echo phenomenon."}

A key technical barrier to reaching such\ndeep contrasts is maintaining wavefront stability on the order of tens of\npicometers, in particular in the presence of a segmented primary mirror. Keck\nObservatory is the only facility with all of the hardware components necessary\nfor validating HWO segment phasing strategies: a large segmented primary\nmirror, capacitive edge sensors, deformable mirror, Zernike wavefront sensor\n(ZWFS), and high contrast science instruments. Taking advantage of these\nparallels, we are using Keck as a testbed for developing and validating HWO\nwavefront sensing and control loop strategies, as well as demonstrating the\nfull system-level segment control architecture for HWO, using existing\ninfrastructure. Recently, we set the stage for this work by using the ZWFS\ninstalled on the Keck II telescope to sense and correct the primary mirror\nsegment pistons in closed-loop in parallel with science observations. This\nresulted in improved Strehl ratios on the NIRC2 science camera (Salama et al.\n2024a). We now aim to directly address concerns related to control authority,\nactuator offload, and loop stability - tasks which require Keck's existing\ninfrastructure, but which do not require picometer wavefront stability.\nMoreover, successful comparisons of observed and predicted performances will\nvalidate, on a real operating observatory, the HWO error budget methodology and\nin particular its approach to nested loops operating at multiple timescales."}

The Einstein Gauss\nBonnet (EGB) theory is one such extension that adds spacetime corrections\nrelated to curvature. Since the standard Gauss Bonnet term is purely\ntopological, it does not contribute to the field equations in four dimensions.\nTo get around this restriction, however, an invariant four dimensional limit\nhas been developed. In this work, we study Extreme Compact Charged Objects\n(ECCOs), which can resemble black holes, in a gravity framework that is\ncompatible with Einstein Gauss Bonnet in four dimensions. Our main goal is to\ncompare theoretical predictions with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\nobservational data in order to constrain the Gauss Bonnet coupling constant\n{\\alpha}. In order to achieve this, we investigate important optical\ncharacteristics like the shadow, light bending angle, and other associated\nobservables, as well as the geodesic structure of ECCO spacetimes in EGB\ngravity. Finally, we apply these findings to constrain the Gauss Bonnet\nconstant."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and\nspherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear\nelectrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual\nformalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a\nreal scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to\nthe regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free\nbranches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are\nentropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints,\nfinding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental\nscalar quasi-normal modes ($< 10\\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios),\nindicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do\nnot rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to\nexplore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes,\nextending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-like cases."}

One way to probe their impact is through the\nanalytical study of astrophysical processes such as black hole accretion. Since\naccretion efficiently converts gravitational energy into radiation, this makes\nit a powerful tool to test modified gravity (MOG) theories and\nhigher-dimensional frameworks via the behavior of dark compact objects like\nblack holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. In this work, we investigate the\ndynamics of neutral particles around a higher-dimensional, regular, spherically\nsymmetric MOG compact object, focusing on the innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO), energy flux, temperature, and differential luminosity. We further\nanalyze the accretion of a perfect fluid onto the same object, deriving\nanalytical expressions for the four-velocity and proper energy density of the\ninflowing matter. Our findings show that extra dimensions reduce the ISCO\nradius while enhancing the corresponding flux and temperature. Finally, by\ncomparing the effective disk temperature $T_{\\text{eff}}$ with Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A*, we argue that MOG and\nhigher-dimensional corrections to the accretion disk properties could be close\nto the current threshold of detectability."}

This entropy,\nrecently proposed as a power-law extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law,\narises from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency\nwith the Clausius relation. By applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture,\nthe resulting corrections to the Friedmann equations modify the evolution of\nthe Hubble parameter. Consequently, even the standard supergravity coupling\nbetween the Ricci scalar and the baryon current can generate a non-vanishing\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry. Comparison with observational data yields a\nstringent constraint on the entropic exponent, namely $0 < 1 - n \\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$, at the decoupling temperature $T_D \\simeq\n10^{16}\\,\\text{GeV}$, corresponding to the current upper limit on tensor-mode\nfluctuations at the inflationary scale.

Originally proved by Schoen-Yau and later Witten, these theorems\nwere established for asymptotically flat manifolds where the metric tends to\nthe standard Euclidean metric and whose second fundamental form decays to zero\nat infinity. This ansatz on the metric and second fundamental form is motivated\nby the desire to model an isolated gravitational system with a Minkowski space\nbackground for the spacetime. However, actual astrophysical massive objects are\nnot truly isolated but rather exist within an expanding cosmological universe,\nwhere the second fundamental form is umbilic. With this in mind, we seek a\nnotion of energy for initial data sets with an umbilic second fundamental form.\nIn this work, we present a definition of energy in such an expanding\ncosmological setting. Instead of Minkowski space, we take de Sitter space as\nthe background spacetime, which, when written in flat-expanding coordinates, is\nfoliated by umbilic hypersurfaces each isometric to Euclidean 3-space. This\ncosmological setting necessitates a quasi-local energy definition, as the\npresence of a cosmological horizon in de Sitter space obstructs a global one.\nWe define energy in this quasi-local setting by adapting the Liu-Yau energy to\nour framework and establish positivity of this energy for certain bounded\nvalues of the cosmological constant."}
