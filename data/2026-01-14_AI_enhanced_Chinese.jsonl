Such characterization is critical for Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy (CRES), an advancing new measurement technique that has the potential to greatly benefit fundamental physics measurements. In CRES, charged particles emit cyclotron radiation at frequencies that provide their energy measurement. As a notable example, the Project 8 experiment aims to kinematically infer the neutrino mass by measuring the energies of electrons emitted in tritium beta decay using CRES. In near-term realizations of Project 8, resonant cylindrical cavities will be used for CRES readout, in a configuration with a magnetic field oriented along the symmetry axis, and electrons following helical cyclotron trajectories confined to the cavity interior. The physics of electromagnetic radiation in these environments is complicated, since it involves both the motion of the emitting particle and the mode structure imposed by the cavity. In this work, we derive and validate an analytic model for how an oscillating, trapped electron radiates into cavity modes, and the power and frequency content of the radiation that can be read out from these events. These results can be used to guide the design of cavities for future CRES and other experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u5706\u67f1\u5f62\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3aCRES\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8154\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "CRES\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5355\u4e2a\u7c92\u5b50\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7535\u78c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8eProject 8\u7b49\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u632f\u8361\u3001\u4fd8\u83b7\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u8154\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u5728\u5706\u67f1\u8c10\u632f\u8154\u4e2d\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u8bfb\u51fa\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765CRES\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u8154\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f90\u5c04\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The model employs efficient inference using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model sampling and is pre-trained on GEANT4 simulations before being adapted to a new calorimeter geometry through Low-Rank Adaptation, requiring only a small post-training dataset. We evaluate physically meaningful observables, including total deposited energy, energy-weighted radius, and shower dispersion, obtaining relative root mean square error values below 2% for representative high-energy cases. This is in line with state-of-the-art calorimeter surrogates which report comparable fidelity on high-level observables. Furthermore, we compare gradients of a reconstruction-based utility function with respect to design parameters between the surrogate and finite-difference references. The diffusion surrogate reproduces the qualitative structure and directional trends of the true utility landscape, providing usable sensitivities for gradient-based optimization. These results show that diffusion-based surrogates can accelerate simulation-driven detector design while enabling differentiable, gradient-informed analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u7c07\u5c04\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DDIM\u91c7\u6837\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u80fd\u91cf\u6c89\u79ef\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGEANT4\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eDDIM\u91c7\u6837\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728GEANT4\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u6280\u672f\u9002\u914d\u65b0\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u603b\u6c89\u79ef\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u534a\u5f84\u548c\u7c07\u5c04\u8272\u6563\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9RMS\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u91cf\u80fd\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u6548\u7528\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u6a21\u62df\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7528\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper reports the optical design and optimization of this spectrometer, aiming for an ultrahigh energy resolution of <10 meV in the soft X-ray range. Conventional RIXS spectrometers using monochromatic incident X-rays suffer from a severe trade-off between energy resolution and measurement efficiency, which makes achieving resolutions of <10 meV practically unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we adopted the $h\u03bd^2$ concept using dispersive incident X-rays, based on a comparative study. This approach decouples the energy resolution from the incident bandwidth. We estimate that our 2D-RIXS spectrometer improves efficiency by more than a factor of 10 compared to conventional spectrometers. The 2D-RIXS spectrometer has been successfully commissioned, demonstrating that sub-10 meV resolution measurement is achievable with practical throughput.

By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries.

Current detection and classification technologies, including cameras, LiDAR, and conventional radar systems, often struggle to reliably identify and differentiate drones, especially those of similar models, under diverse environmental conditions and at extended ranges. Moreover, low radar cross sections and clutter further complicate accurate drone identification. To address these limitations, we propose a novel drone classification method based on artificial micro-Doppler signatures encoded by resonant electromagnetic stickers attached to drone blades. These tags generate distinctive, configuration-specific radar returns, enabling robust identification. We develop a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of processing raw radar signals, achieving high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments were conducted both in anechoic chambers with 43 tag configurations and outdoors under realistic flight trajectories and noise conditions. Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), provided insight into code separability and robustness. Our results demonstrate reliable drone classification performance at signal-to-noise ratios as low as 7 dB, indicating the feasibility of long-range detection with advanced surveillance radar systems. Preliminary range estimations indicate potential operational distances of several kilometers, suitable for critical applications such as airport airspace monitoring. The integration of electromagnetic tagging with machine learning enables scalable and efficient drone identification, paving the way for enhanced aerial traffic management and security in increasingly congested airspaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u78c1\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c10\u632f\u7535\u78c1\u8d34\u7247\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u96f7\u8fbe\u56de\u6ce2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff08\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3001LiDAR\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3001\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u578b\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f4e\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u6742\u6ce2\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b", "method": "\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u53f6\u7247\u4e0a\u7c98\u8d34\u8c10\u632f\u7535\u78c1\u8d34\u7247\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7279\u5fae\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u7528CNN\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u96f7\u8fbe\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PCA\u548cUMAP\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u548c\u964d\u7ef4", "result": "\u5728\u6d88\u58f0\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd543\u79cd\u6807\u7b7e\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6237\u5916\u771f\u5b9e\u98de\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u81f37dB\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u516c\u91cc\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b", "conclusion": "\u7535\u78c1\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u573a\u7a7a\u57df\u76d1\u63a7\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168"}}

The background contamination and statistical fluctuations of typical astronomical images make this a challenging statistical task, particularly for X-ray images with low surface brightness. We develop a three-step Bayesian procedure to identify the boundaries of irregularly shaped sources. We first apply a Bayesian multiscale reconstruction algorithm known as LIRA to obtain posterior pixelwise probability distributions of the source intensity that properly account for known structures, astrophysical background, and the effect of the telescope point spread function. Next, we adopt an Ising model to group pixels with similar intensities into cohesive regions corresponding to background and source. Finally, the boundary is derived on the basis of the most likely aggregation of pixels into the source region. Because the overall model combines LIRA and the Ising model, we call it LIRA-Ising. We verify the proposed method using a set of simulation studies. We then apply it to the Chandra X-ray Observatory images of two high redshift quasars, PKS J1421-0643 and 0730+257, to determine the extent and morphology of X-ray jets.

Recent developments in three-dimensional (3D) nanomagnetism have highlighted the growing need for imaging techniques that can capture magnetic structures across curved or tilted surfaces with high sensitivity. Though widely used as a powerful technique for imaging magnetization states, conventional magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) microscopy faces inherent limitations in measuring non-planar systems due to its shallow depth of field (DOF). Here, we present an extended depth of field MOKE imaging approach, combining through-focus scanning with image-stitching-based reconstruction, to obtain sharp and well-resolved magnetic domain images across non-planar sample geometries. The method is validated on both perpendicularly and in-plane magnetized films tilted on purpose for this study, enabling quantitative analysis of domain morphology and detection sensitivity. This laboratory-accessible technique provides a fast and versatile route for 3D magnetic imaging, complementing large-scale X-ray-based methods and offering a practical tool for investigating non-planar magnetic samples with tilted or curved 3D geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u666f\u6df1\u7684\u78c1\u5149\u514b\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7126\u70b9\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u78c1\u6027\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u6210\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u78c1\u5149\u514b\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u7531\u4e8e\u666f\u6df1\u6d45\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6d4b\u91cf\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u78c1\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4e09\u7ef4\u7eb3\u7c73\u78c1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u66f2\u9762\u6216\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u78c1\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7126\u70b9\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u666f\u6df1\u7684\u78c1\u5149\u514b\u5c14\u6548\u5e94\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u6837\u54c1\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u78c1\u7574\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u9762\u5185\u78c1\u5316\u8584\u819c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u503e\u659c\u6837\u54c1\u7684\u78c1\u7574\u5f62\u6001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u78c1\u6210\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21X\u5c04\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e73\u9762\u78c1\u6027\u6837\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdRFI\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08IQRM\u3001SKF\u3001ZDMF\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540cRFI\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684RFI\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c04\u7535\u9891\u7387\u5e72\u6270\uff08RFI\uff09\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u6682\u73b0\u6e90\u7684\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728SKAO\u7b49\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684RFI\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540cRFI\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IQRM\u3001SKF\u3001ZDMF\u4e09\u79cdRFI\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u641c\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u5165\u8109\u51b2\u7684\u6062\u590d\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u4eae\u5ea6\u3001\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u8272\u6563\u91cf\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cdRFI\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540cRFI\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5355\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cRFI\u73af\u5883\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684RFI\u6291\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

The ever-increasing use of LIBs has highlighted a gap in understanding of their behavior throughout their life-cycle. Current monitoring systems rely on electrical and sometimes temperature measurements to assess the internal state which limits information about complex electrochemical processes. In response, ultrasonic testing (UT) has shown promise for non-invasive assessment due to its ease of use and sensitivity to mechanical changes which are correlated with electrochemical changes within the battery. We summarize the research in UT methods applied to LIBs throughout their life-cycle and the relevant techniques at each stage. We also discuss physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches used to interpret ultrasonic signals in the context of LIBs, with an emphasis on the existing challenge of establishing rigorous links between electrochemical behavior and elastic and poroelastic wave physics to gain insight regarding physical changes in the LIB that can be directly measured using UT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of implementing UT across the LIB life-cycle and identify opportunities for further research.

M"], "title": "The Scalar Mach-Sciama Theory of Gravitation", "comment": "Manuscript submitted for peer review", "summary": "We formulate a scalar realization of Sciama's Machian programme within the general Bergmann-Wagoner class of scalar--tensor gravity. Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\\{{\\cal I}_1,{\\cal I}_2,{\\cal I}_3,\\hat g_{\u03bc\u03bd}\\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the E\u00f6tvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a6c\u8d6b\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u786e\u5b9a\u5b87\u5b99\u60ef\u6027\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u5f31\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0Sciama\u7684\u9a6c\u8d6b\u539f\u7406\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5efa\u7acb\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u9a6c\u8d6b\u5f0f\u60ef\u6027\u5c3a\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u5728Bergmann-Wagoner\u7c7b\u6807\u91cf-\u5f20\u91cf\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u666e\u904d\u5171\u5f62\u8026\u5408\u7684\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5c06\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u7528\u4e0d\u53d8\u96c6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff08\u53ea\u4fdd\u7559\u56e0\u679c\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u63a8\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9a6c\u8d6b\u56e0\u679c\u5047\u8bbe", "result": "\u5728\u5e73\u5766FLRW\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f7b\u8d28\u7f13\u53d8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u6807\u91cf\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u54c8\u52c3\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7269\u8d28\u542b\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u9a6c\u8d6b\u6807\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u666e\u904d\u8026\u5408\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5f31\u573a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6548\u5e94\u4ec5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5f3a\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b87\u5b99\u60ef\u6027\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a6c\u8d6b\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5f31\u573a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u9a6c\u8d6b\u539f\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this work we present the design and the performance of an improved detector, where the KID acts only as sensor and is coupled to dedicated phonon collectors. The separation between the detector and the collectors increases the variation of the quasi-particle density within the device, thereby enhancing its responsivity. The meander of the KID is composed of a 77nm trilayer wire of Aluminum-Titanium-Aluminum, while the phonon collectors are made of a 100nm Aluminum layer and act as quasi-particles funnels. Inside the collectors, the absorbed athermal phonons generate quasi-particles which, after diffusion, are trapped in the lower-gap superconducting trilayer. The performance of this setup is compared to that of a standard phonon-mediated KID, showing an increase in responsivity by around a factor of five.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6539\u8fdb\u578b\u4f4e\u6e29\u58f0\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u5c06KID\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u58f0\u5b50\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\u7ea65\u500d", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KID\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u5668\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5206\u79bb\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a2\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50-\u6838\u76f8\u5e72\u6563\u5c04\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff1aKID\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u8026\u5408\u4e13\u7528\u58f0\u5b50\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u3002KID\u91c7\u752877nm\u94dd-\u949b-\u94dd\u4e09\u5c42\u7ebf\uff0c\u58f0\u5b50\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u4e3a100nm\u94dd\u5c42\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u6f0f\u6597\u3002\u58f0\u5b50\u5728\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u540e\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u5728\u4f4e\u80fd\u9699\u8d85\u5bfc\u4e09\u5c42\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u58f0\u5b50\u4ecb\u5bfcKID\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea65\u500d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u51c6\u7c92\u5b50\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u79bbKID\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u58f0\u5b50\u6536\u96c6\u5668\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6e29\u58f0\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u548c\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide).

The interface is realized by introducing inclined vacuum slits along the lateral sides of the plate. This geometry intentionally breaks symmetry and produces a strongly localized, vortex-like deformation near the slit tips, which provides an efficient coupling pathway from the antisymmetric incident response to a symmetric reflected component. The conversion is quantified in a consistent, field-based manner by extracting the reflected antisymmetric level from the standing-wave envelope on a probe line placed sufficiently far from the slits, and then inferring the converted symmetric energy under a lossless assumption with only two reflected propagating channels. The proposed design delivers strong low-frequency conversion and sustains broadband half-power operation, while parametric studies confirm that the performance is tunable and robust over a wide range of slit angles and widths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u503e\u659c\u72ed\u7f1d\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5f39\u6027\u677f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cd\u5c04\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5165\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u9636\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5170\u59c6\u6ce2\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u9636\u5bf9\u79f0\u5170\u59c6\u6ce2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f39\u6027\u677f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5170\u59c6\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ce2\u5bfc\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u677f\u4fa7\u8fb9\u5f15\u5165\u503e\u659c\u771f\u7a7a\u72ed\u7f1d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6545\u610f\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u72ed\u7f1d\u5c16\u7aef\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6da1\u65cb\u72b6\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u5165\u5c04\u54cd\u5e94\u5230\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cd\u5c04\u5206\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u8026\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u5bbd\u5e26\u534a\u529f\u7387\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u72ed\u7f1d\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53ef\u8c03\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "\u503e\u659c\u72ed\u7f1d\u754c\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5170\u59c6\u6ce2\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8c03\u8c10\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f39\u6027\u6ce2\u64cd\u63a7\u548c\u58f0\u5b50\u5668\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\\sim 45M_\\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\\sim 15 M_\\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e9a\u7fa4\uff08\u7ea615M\u2299\u548c>45M\u2299\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5206\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u673a\u5236\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u661f\u56e2\u8d21\u732e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u81f4\u5bc6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u586b\u5145\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ee3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u503e\u659c\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6548\u87ba\u65cb\u81ea\u65cb\u548c\u8fdb\u52a8\u81ea\u65cb\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5206\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u9884\u671f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u81ea\u65cb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc1\u636e\uff1a\u5728~45M\u2299\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95f4\u9699\u9884\u671f\u8d77\u59cb\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728~15M\u2299\u5904\u5b58\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5206\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u7387\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5cf0\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e9a\u7fa4\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u660e\u8fd1\u592a\u9633\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u8d2b\u91d1\u5c5e\u661f\u56e2\u90fd\u5bf9\u5206\u7ea7\u5408\u5e76\u4eba\u53e3\u6709\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8fd9\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u4eba\u53e3\u81ea\u65cb\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8be6\u7ec6\u8d28\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002"}}

Our goal is to evaluate its performance against the number of training images, classical Tikhonov deconvolution and to assess its generalization capability under varying seeing conditions and noise levels.\n  Methods: Realistic astronomical observations are simulated using the GalSim toolkit, incorporating random transformations, PSF convolution (accounting for both optical and atmospheric effects), and Gaussian white noise. A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability.\n  Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM).

This issue is particularly pressing for tackling fraud in the red wine industry, valued at billions of dollars globally, where product authenticity, brand reputation, and consumer trust are paramount. Whilst many techniques exist for authenticating wine externally, to date performing accurate classification of the contents within unopened bottles remains elusive. Using only a single near-infrared optical excitation source operating at a wavelength of 785 nm, in combination with a bespoke geometry to circumvent the confounding signal of the glass, we demonstrate that through-bottle fluorescence spectra can distinguish between twenty different red wines in their original, intact bottles. All twenty wine bottles were correctly classified with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) revealed strong varietal grouping. This non-invasive and rapid technique has the potential to enable on-site, routine wine authentication to combat the growing issue of wine fraud. The geometry itself is applicable across multiple fields for the analysis of other high-value products through their packaging, where authenticity verification is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528785nm\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u6e90\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9152\u74f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u533a\u5206\u4e8620\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ea2\u8461\u8404\u9152\u3002", "motivation": "\u98df\u54c1\u79d1\u5b66\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5730\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u5bc6\u5c01\u5bb9\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7269\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8461\u8404\u9152\u884c\u4e1a\u5c24\u4e3a\u8feb\u5207\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ea7\u54c1\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u54c1\u724c\u58f0\u8a89\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fe1\u4efb\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u867d\u7136\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u8461\u8404\u9152\u5916\u90e8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u672a\u5f00\u5c01\u74f6\u5185\u5185\u5bb9\u7269\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a785nm\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u5b66\u6fc0\u53d1\u6e90\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u5236\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u73bb\u7483\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9152\u74f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff08LDA\uff09\u548c\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u670920\u79cd\u8461\u8404\u9152\u74f6\u90fd\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8367\u5149\u5149\u8c31\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u7c7b\uff0cLDA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cPCA\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u54c1\u79cd\u5206\u7ec4\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5feb\u901f\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u573a\u5e38\u89c4\u8461\u8404\u9152\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8461\u8404\u9152\u6b3a\u8bc8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd8\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u88c5\u8fdb\u884c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u4ea7\u54c1\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The system is described by two-dimensional in-plane linear elasticity, and the slits are treated as voids. The conversion is quantified by the ratio between the reflected shear-wave energy and the incident compressional-wave energy, obtained from mode decomposition and energy-flux evaluation below the surface. The results indicate that the inclined geometry introduces strong coupling between normal and tangential motions at the boundary, enabling suppression of the ordinary compressional reflection while redirecting the reflected energy into the shear channel.

Extending our previous work, where multistate SFDM solutions were shown to form ``gravitational atoms'' capable of explaining the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies (VPOS), we analyze here the coupled dynamics of the scalar and a gauge field at the perturbative level. By solving the perturbed Klein-Gordon and gauge-field equations, we find the temporal evolution and show that the spatial structure of the induced electromagnetic fields is governed by the same spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics that characterize the ground and excited states of the multi-state SFDM halo. Remarkably, the presence of the gauge field does not modify the dark-matter density distribution, which preserves the multi-state configuration previously obtained. Our results demonstrate that a charged multi-state SFDM halo can generate coherent, large-scale magnetic fields whose morphology is determined by the excited modes of the scalar field, providing a unified framework in which both galactic magnetic fields and VPOS-like structures originate from the underlying quantum nature of dark matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5e26\u7535\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u4ea7\u751f\u661f\u7cfb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5fae\u9ad8\u65af\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5fae\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea7\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8e\u5e26\u7535\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\uff0c\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u548c\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5206\u5e03\uff08VPOS\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u5148\u524d\u591a\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5f62\u6210\"\u5f15\u529b\u539f\u5b50\"\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u6270\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u6c42\u89e3\u5fae\u6270Klein-Gordon\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7531\u7403\u8d1d\u585e\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u548c\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u540c\uff1b\u89c4\u8303\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5e26\u7535\u591a\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5e72\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e26\u7535\u591a\u6001\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u6655\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u5f62\u6001\u7531\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6fc0\u53d1\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u78c1\u573a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u591a\u6001\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u661f\u7cfb\u78c1\u573a\u548cVPOS\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e90\u4e8e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u91cf\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728Horava-Lifshitz\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7d2b\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u548c\u8dd1\u52a8\u6807\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\"\u6e6e\u706d\u81f3\u65e0\"\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Horava-Lifshitz\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7d2b\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8ff7\u4f60\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u6790Wheeler-DeWitt\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u7d2b\u5916\u533a\u57df\uff08\u9ad8\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f2\u7387\u9879\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u539f\u59cbHorava-Lifshitz\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u62d3\u5bf9\u5e94\u9879\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u3002\u8003\u8651\u7403\u9762\u3001\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u622a\u9762\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u3001\u8d1f\u6216\u96f6\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8003\u8651\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7d2b\u5916\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9879\u548c\u8dd1\u52a8\u6807\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u5e94\u5171\u540c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\"\u6e6e\u706d\u81f3\u65e0\"\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cHorava-Lifshitz\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u51fa\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u7684\"\u6e6e\u706d\u81f3\u65e0\"\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "Horava-Lifshitz\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u6291\u5236\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5947\u70b9\u5904\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6e6e\u706d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5947\u70b9\u6d88\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lema\u00eetre-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon.

Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed.

In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9ed1\u6d1e\u71b5\u6e90\u4e8e\u970d\u91d1-\u5b89\u9c81\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9677\u83b7\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u622a\u65ad\u53d1\u6563\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u71b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9644\u8fd1\u5149\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u71b5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u71b5\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u5c06\u71b5\u4e0e\u9677\u83b7\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8ba1\u6570\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u65f6\u7a7a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli\u65b9\u7a0b\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u52a0\u901f\u89c2\u6d4b\u8005\u7684\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6700\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u622a\u65ad\u53d1\u6563\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u9677\u83b7\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u70ed\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u9677\u83b7\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u70ed\u5206\u5e03\u5b58\u50a8\u4e86\u53ef\u89c2\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u4ece\u8fdc\u5904\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\uff1b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a100 Hz\uff08\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\uff09\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u867d\u5728~3M\u5916\u4e0d\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u9644\u8fd1\u96f6\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed1\u6d1e\u71b5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u970d\u91d1-\u5b89\u9c81\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6301\u7eed\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9677\u83b7\u5f15\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6784\u6210\u8fd1\u89c6\u754c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u6da8\u843d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u6d1e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fae\u89c2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}
