### [1] [Experimental Validation for Serial Conjunction of Diffraction-limited Coronagraph and Fiber Nuller](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18663)
*Satoshi Itoh,Taro Matsuo,Reiki Kojima,Takahiro Sumi,Motohide Tamura*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种串联的消光系统，结合了Lyot日冕仪和光纤消光器，验证了其在高光谱带宽下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统一维衍射极限日冕仪（1DDLC）对光谱带宽和倾斜像差高度敏感的问题，提升其性能。

Method: 采用串联消光系统，结合1DDLC和光纤消光单元，通过Lyot平面掩模和单模光纤分离光束。

Result: 在波长低于设计中心波长6%时，对比度抑制能力达到3.5×10^-5，约为单独1DDLC的1/20。

Conclusion: 串联系统在高光谱带宽下表现稳健，未来需进一步验证低于10^-5的对比度抑制能力。

Abstract: We report the experimental results of a serially conjoined nuller system,
which combines a type of Lyot coronagraph with a fiber nuller. The utilized
one-dimensional diffraction-limited coronagraph (1DDLC) has promising features
(binary nuller, small inner working angles (IWAs)). Still, it has a performance
that is highly sensitive to spectral bandwidth and tilt aberrations.
Nevertheless, for the 1DDLC, wavelengths other than the design wavelength
introduce leaks with a flat wavefront on the Lyot-stop plane, preserving the
same complex amplitude profile as an on-axis point source. This property
supports the concept of serially coupling additional nullers after the 1DDLC.
The fiber-nulling unit employs a Lyot-plane mask, relay optics (1/100$\times$),
and a single-mode fiber. The Lyot-plane mask splits the incoming beam --
comprising leakage from the 1DDLC and planetary light -- into four beams so
that, in principle, the on-axis single-mode fiber does not couple with the
on-axis leak from the 1DDLC. For the wavelength 6-\% less than the
coronagraph's design-center wavelength, we confirmed the contrast mitigation
ability of $3.5 \times 10^{-5}$, which is about 1/20 times the value of the
case with only 1DDLC. The resultant value approximately reaches the 1DDLC's
contrast mitigation ability at the design center wavelength demonstrated in the
previous study, suggesting that the combined system works robustly against the
broad spectral bandwidth. Future work needs to address the demonstration of the
anticipated robustness for the contrast-mitigation level lower than about
$10^{-5}$.

### [4] [Recommendations to overcome language barriers in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18682)
*José Antonio Alonso Pavón,Andrés Alejandro Plazas Malagón*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 报告提出五项建议，旨在减少Vera C. Rubin天文台研究生态系统中的语言障碍，促进非英语母语研究者的参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域的英语霸权限制了研究者的参与和生产力，因此需要推动多语言化和包容性。

Method: 建议包括多语言演示、学术写作培训、虚拟写作中心、语言支持项目和写作静修，结合教学理论和实证研究。

Result: 这些措施旨在将语言从障碍转变为资源，促进全球研究合作中的多语言文化。

Conclusion: 报告倡导灵活、社区驱动的策略，以推动更公平的科学交流和多元研究文化。

Abstract: The report presents a comprehensive set of five recommendations to reduce
language barriers within the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Research Ecosystem,
promoting greater inclusion of researchers who are speakers of English as an
additional language. Recognizing that English linguistic hegemony in science
limits participation and productivity, the document proposes multilingual
presentation formats, academic writing training, a Virtual Writing Center,
language support programs, and writing retreats. Each recommendation is
grounded in both pedagogical theory and empirical evidence, with an emphasis on
collaborative, socially embedded approaches to scientific writing. The proposed
academic writing training integrates constructivist and socio-cultural
perspectives, emphasizing genre awareness, rhetorical competence, and
reflective practices. The Virtual Writing Center would serve as a permanent
infrastructure offering personalized tutoring and peer review support, while
the language support programs address ongoing needs through workshops,
consultations, and access to language tools. Writing retreats provide immersive
environments for focused work and mentorship. The recommendations also
encourage ethical use of AI tools for translation and writing assistance,
fostering digital literacy alongside linguistic proficiency. Collectively,
these initiatives aim to transform language from a barrier into a resource,
recognizing multilingualism as an asset in global research collaboration.
Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all solution, the document advocates for
adaptable, community-driven strategies that can evolve within the diverse
institutional and disciplinary contexts of the Rubin Research Ecosystem. By
implementing these practices, the Ecosystem could lead efforts to democratize
scientific communication and foster a more equitable, multilingual research
culture.

### [5] [ARVE: Analyzing Radial Velocity Elements. I. The Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18869)
*K. Al Moulla*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: ARVE是一个基于Python的软件，用于提取和分析径向速度（RV）数据，特别关注恒星活动和行星信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服恒星活动对RV精度的限制，提供多功能且用户友好的工具。

Method: ARVE采用模块化设计，分为四个子类：功能、数据、恒星和行星，支持多种RV提取和分析技术。

Result: 通过HARPS-N太阳数据展示了ARVE的功能，包括恒星活动特征和行星检测限的分析。

Conclusion: ARVE有望成为恒星活动缓解技术的重要工具，未来可扩展功能和兼容更多光谱仪。

Abstract: Context. In order to overcome the radial velocity (RV) precision barrier
imposed by stellar variability, there has been a surge of software aimed at
simulating and modeling these activity patterns. Aims. We present Analyzing
Radial Velocity Elements (ARVE), a Python-based software which enables RV
extraction using various customizable techniques, and subsequent analysis of
the stellar and planetary signals present in the RVs. One of ARVE's unique
features is its library of pre-computed auxiliary data, which includes
synthetic spectra and spectral line masks, allowing the code to efficiently
perform certain routines with minimal input from the user. Methods. ARVE is a
class-based and modular code in which its functionalities are divided between
four subclasses: functions, which handles general functions utilized by the
other subclasses; data, which reads the input data, loads the auxiliary data,
and extracts RVs from input high-resolution spectra; star, which characterizes
the stellar activity components present in the RV time series; and planets,
which performs fits of Keplerian signals in the data and offers
injection-recovery tests of fictitious planets to determine the detection
limits. Results. Demonstrations of ARVE are performed on three years of HARPS-N
solar data. We show the evolution of granulation and supergranulation
characteristic timescales with activity level, and we investigate the
differences in planetary period-mass detection limits when extracting RVs with
different methods. Conclusions. As stellar activity mitigation techniques grow
more diverse, we foresee that a tool like ARVE could greatly benefit the
community by offering a user-friendly and multi-functional approach to extract
and analyze RV time series. With its current code structure, expanded
functionality and increased compatibility with more spectrographs should be
easily addable to future versions of ARVE.

Motivation: 在自适应光学系统中，单波前传感器模型难以满足高分辨率波前重建需求，因此探索多波前传感器模型以提升重建精度。

Method: 基于湍流统计和泰勒冻结流假设，结合风速度信息，提出多波前传感器重建模型，并引入H2正则化项。

Result: 数值模拟验证了正则化项和多波前传感器策略在相同实验条件下的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 多波前传感器模型结合H2正则化项显著提升了高分辨率波前重建的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: In ground-based astronomy, Adaptive Optics (AO) is a pivotal technique,
engineered to correct wavefront phase distortions and thereby enhance the
quality of the observed images. Integral to an AO system is the wavefront
sensor (WFS), which is crucial for detecting wavefront aberrations from guide
stars, essential for phase calculations. Many models based on a single-WFS
model have been proposed to obtain the high-resolution phase of the incoming
wavefront. In this paper, we delve into the realm of multiple WFSs within the
framework of state-of-the-art telescope setups for high-resolution phase
reconstruction. We propose a model for reconstructing a high-resolution
wavefront from a sequence of wavefront gradient data from multiple WFSs. Our
model is based on the turbulence statistics and the Taylor frozen flow
hypothesis, incorporating knowledge of the wind velocities in atmospheric
turbulence layers. We also introduce an $H_2$ regularization term, especially
for atmospheric characteristics under von Karman statistics, and provide a
theoretical analysis for $H^2$ space within $H^{11/6}$. Numerical simulations
are conducted to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
regularization term and multi-WFS reconstruction strategy under identical
experimental conditions.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ARGOS项目开发的数字信号处理系统，用于小型天线阵列的干涉测量，展示了高性能无线电天文处理后端的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发下一代小型天线阵列（'small-D, big-N'）的技术，以降低成本并提高性能。

Method: 使用RFSoC 4x2评估板和Xilinx Vitis HLS C++开发数字信号处理系统，包括数字化、信道化、延迟校正和增益校正。

Result: 硬件验证显示信道响应和延迟校正符合理论预期，且在Effelsberg望远镜上的观测性能与传统后端相当。

Conclusion: 高层次合成（HLS）语言在高性能无线电天文处理后端开发中具有实用性。

Abstract: Radio interferometers provide the means to perform the wide-field-of-view
(FoV), high-sensitivity observations required for modern radio surveys. As
computing power per cost has decreased, there has been a move towards larger
arrays of smaller dishes, such as DSA-2000, the upcoming HIRAX, CHORD and SKA
radio telescopes. Such arrays can have simpler receiver designs with
room-temperature low-noise amplifiers and direct sampling to achieve, greatly
reducing the cost per antenna. The ARGOS project is currently developing an
array of five 6-meter antennas that will be used to demonstrate the technology
required for a next generation "small-D, big-N" radio interferometer in Europe.
In this work, our objective was to implement a first-stage digital signal
processing system for the ARGOS demonstrator array, providing digitization,
channelization, delay correction and frequency-dependent complex gain
correction. The system is intended to produce delay and phase corrected
dual-polarization channelized voltages in the frequency range 1-3 GHz with a
nominal channel bandwidth of 1 MHz. We use an RFSoC 4x2 evaluation board with
four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that can simultaneously sample two 1
GHz, dual-polarization bands. We use Xilinx Vitis HLS C++ to develop the
required firmware as a set of customizable modules suitable for rapid
prototyping. We performed hardware verification of the channel response of the
critically sampled PFB and of the delay correction, showing both to be
consistent with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, the board was installed
at the Effelsberg 100-meter radio telescope where we performed commensal pulsar
observations with the Effelsberg Direct Digitization backend, showing
comparable performance. This work demonstrates the utility of high-level
synthesis (HLS) languages in the development of high performance radio
astronomy processing backends.

Abstract: We have developed a novel tracking detector utilizing a water-based liquid
scintillator (WbLS) for the accurate characterization of neutrino interactions
on a water target. In this detector, the WbLS is optically segmented into small
cells by reflective separators, and the scintillation light is read out in
three directions using wavelength-shifting fibers coupled to silicon
photomultipliers. We developed and optimized WbLS samples for this application
and measured their light yield using cosmic-ray muons. Subsequently, we
constructed a prototype of the WbLS tracking detector and evaluated its
performance with a positron beam. The beam test demonstrated good tracking
performance, although the light yield was lower than required. The result
prompted a review of the surfactant used in the WbLS and the material of the
optical separators, leading to a significant improvement in light yield. In
this paper, we report on a design of the WbLS tracking detector, the
development of the WbLS, the results of the beam test, and subsequent
improvements to the WbLS and optical separators.

### [10] [Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC) for Nuclear Fusion Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19425)
*Kimberley Lennon,Chantal Shand,Gemma Wilson,Robin Smith*

Main category: physics.ins-det

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的效率计算算法MaLBEC，用于快速准确计算中子激活分析中的伽马能谱效率，相比传统MCNP方法显著减少计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子激活分析中伽马能谱效率的准确计算对核聚变研究至关重要，传统方法计算耗时。

Method: 开发MaLBEC算法，利用监督机器学习技术，仅需四个输入即可计算效率。

Result: MaLBEC计算效率与MCNP结果平均偏差5%，计算时间减少99.96%，活性计算结果偏差3%。

Conclusion: MaLBEC在保持高精度的同时大幅提升计算效率，适用于核聚变研究。

Abstract: Diagnostics are critical for commercial and research fusion machines, since
measuring and understanding plasma features is important to sustaining fusion
reactions. The neutron flux (and therefore fusion power) can be indirectly
calculated using neutron activation analyses, where potentially large numbers
of activation foils are placed in the neutron flux, and delayed gammas from key
reactions are measured via gamma spectrometry. In gamma spectrometry, absolute
efficiency forms part of the activity calculation, and equals to the ratio of
the total number of photons detected to the number emitted by a radioactive
sample. Hence, it is imperative that they are calculated efficiently and
accurately. This paper presents a novel digital efficiency calculation
algorithm, the Machine Learning Based Efficiency Calculator (MaLBEC), that uses
state-of-the-art supervised machine learning techniques to calculate efficiency
values of a given sample, from only four inputs. In this paper, the performance
of the MaLBEC is demonstrated with a fusion sample and compares the values to a
traditional efficiency calculation method, Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP). The
efficiencies from the MaLBEC were within an average 5\% of the ones produced by
MCNP, but with an exceptional reduction in computation time of 99.96\%. When
the efficiency values from both methods were used in the activity calculation,
the MaLBEC was within 3\% of the MCNP results.

Main category: physics.space-ph

Conclusion: 该研究将微观非线性物理与宏观模型框架结合，统一解释了辐射带动态，为空间天气预报提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Van Allen radiation belts contain relativistic electrons trapped by
Earth's magnetic field, posing serious risks to spacecraft. Chorus waves are
known to accelerate these electrons via resonant interactions, but these
interactions are inherently nonlinear and coherent. How such processes shape
large-scale electron dynamics remains unresolved. Two competing paradigms,
nonlinear advection and diffusive transport, have been debated for decades.
Here, we address this controversy using large-scale first-principles
simulations that self-consistently generate realistic chorus wave fields,
coupled with test particle modeling. We find that electron motion is coherent
on short timescales comparable to or less than a bounce period but becomes
stochastic over longer timescales due to phase decorrelation. The resulting
transport coefficients support the use of quasilinear diffusion theory for
long-term evolution. This work bridges microscopic nonlinear physics with
macroscopic modeling frameworks, offering a unified explanation of radiation
belt dynamics and advancing the foundation for space weather forecasting.

Result: 确认宇宙反弹发生在$t=0$，能量密度在反弹时达到峰值，且需要违反NEC和SEC条件。

Conclusion: 反弹宇宙学在$f(T, \mathcal{T})$重力框架下可行，NEC和SEC的违反是关键条件。

Abstract: The singularity and inflationary problems have posed significant challenges
for understanding the universe's origin and evolution. Bouncing cosmology has
emerged as a promising alternative to standard cosmological models, offering a
non-singular approach to early universe dynamics by facilitating a "bounce"
rather than a singular beginning. In this study, we explore the feasibility of
modeling specific bouncing scenarios within the framework of $ f(T,
\mathcal{T}) $ gravity, allowing for a comprehensive coupling between the
torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$.
We analyze two $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ models: a linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) =
\alpha T + \beta \mathcal{T}$ and a non-linear model $f(T, \mathcal{T}) =
\alpha \sqrt{-T} + \beta \mathcal{T}$, with a parameterized scale factor $a(t)
= \sqrt{a_0^2 + \gamma^2 t^2}$ to capture the bounce behavior. The analysis
confirms a cosmic bounce at $t = 0 $, where the Hubble parameter $H = 0$
signals a transition from contraction to expansion. A crucial condition for
achieving the bounce is the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near
the bounce, enabling the equation of state (EoS) parameter to enter the phantom
region ($\omega < -1$). Both models exhibit an increase in energy density as
the universe approaches the bounce, peaking at the bounce epoch and then
decreasing post-bounce. Pressure remains negative throughout, with the EoS
parameter crossing into the phantom region near the bounce in both positive and
negative time zones. Our findings show that NEC and strong energy condition
(SEC) violations are essential for the non-singular bounce, while the dominant
energy condition (DEC) is satisfied, ensuring a consistent matter
distribution...

TL;DR: 论文探讨了一种生成轴对称非真空广义相对论解的方法，发现其仅生成Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko时空，且这些时空具有双重可分离性。研究还表明这些时空无法由某些特定物质场生成。

Motivation: 重新审视一种生成轴对称非真空解的算法，验证其适用范围及物理一致性。

Method: 使用改进的Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou算法，限制于渐近平坦时空，分析生成时空的性质及物质场限制。

Result: 算法仅生成双重可分离时空，且无法由无质量实标量场或完美流体生成，电磁场仅生成Kerr-Newman族。

Conclusion: 该算法生成的时空对称性丰富，但需谨慎用于构造物理一致的解。

Abstract: A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric
nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating
techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou
algorithm, restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes, and demonstrate that
this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes.
Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are
both separable. We call these "doubly separable" spacetimes. We identify a
subclass of the spacetimes that might admit a separable Dirac equation by
explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. The high degree of symmetry in
these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in
specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these
spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that
doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or
perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman
family. Notably, this rules out the elusive spinning counterpart of the
Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetime, which contains a scalar
field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates
spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like
black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for
caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with
prespecified matter content.

superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been
kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes,
that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by
the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as
coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic
quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of
ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective
perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by
existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the
discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric
configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing
the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area
$A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic structure of white dwarfs (WDs)
within the framework of modified gravity theory $f(R, T, L_m) = R + \alpha T
L_m$, which introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature.
Using a realistic equation of state (EoS) that includes contributions from a
relativistic degenerate electron gas and ionic lattice effects, we solve the
modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for two standard choices of
the matter Lagrangian density: $L_m = p$ and $L_m = -\rho$. We show that the
extra $\alpha TL_m$ term significantly alters the mass-radius relation of WDs,
especially at high central densities $( \rho_c \gtrsim 10^8 - 10^9\,\rm
g/cm^3)$, allowing for stable super-Chandrasekhar configurations. In
particular, depending on the sign and magnitude of the parameter $\alpha$, the
maximum mass can increase or decrease, and in some regimes, the usual critical
point indicating the transition from stability to instability disappears. Our
findings suggest that $f(R,T,L_m)$ gravity provides a viable framework to
explain the existence of massive WDs beyond the classical Chandrasekhar limit.

Abstract: We here investigate the consequences of an exotic fluid, exhibiting negative
radial and tangential pressures, \emph{de facto} violating the Zel'dovich
limit, on a regular solution that easily generalizes the Schwarzschild black
hole. More precisely, we focus on the regular Fan-Wang spacetime, computing how
the black hole shadow images, surrounded by the quoted fluid, is modified
through the presence of \emph{negative} equations of state for the two pressure
components. Even though quite different from quintessence, we consider constant
radial and tangential equations of state with the aim of emulating, but not
reproducing, dark energy effects. Moreover, we explore the main properties of
infalling spherical accretion flows and, accordingly, the influence of the
equations of state on the horizons, photosphere, and impact parameter of the
Fan-Wang black hole. Afterwards, we examine the luminosities of the shadow and
the photon ring in two distinct spherically accretion flows, as well as the
observed specific intensity of the shadow itself. Last but not least, we
physically interpret the impact of negative pressures on our findings and
discuss possible extensions to the isotropic case.

Abstract: Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature
gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars
over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial
oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky
gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact
stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory
causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in
contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static
exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental
frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling
constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the
transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the
maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main
analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity
equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with
results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class
of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.

Abstract: Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical
friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and
gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from
scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single
black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As
a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic
simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar
field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion
acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation,
velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not
a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion
modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This
additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a
dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.

Conclusion: 洛伦兹破坏参数ℓ和ModMax参数γ显著影响黑洞的扰动模式和辐射特性，揭示了非热辐射行为。

Abstract: We formulate and analyze a new class of electrically charged black hole (BH)
solutions in Lorentz-violating gravity, where nonlinear ModMax electrodynamics
is nonminimally coupled to a Kalb-Ramond (KR) two-form field. The spontaneous
breaking of local Lorentz symmetry is triggered by a nonzero vacuum expectation
value of the KR field, characterized by a small dimensionless parameter $\ell$.
To incorporate both standard and phantom sectors, we introduce a discrete
sign-flip parameter $\zeta = \pm1$, which flips the gauge-kinetic terms in the
phantom ($\zeta = -1$) branch. Assuming a vanishing cosmological constant and a
self-interacting potential with minimum $V' = 0$, we obtain exact analytical
solutions for the metric function and electric potential. The resulting
spacetime interpolates between Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and ModMax
BHs, with curvature scalars showing deviations controlled by $(\ell, \gamma,
\zeta)$. We study scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations
using both frequency-domain (Pade-averaged WKB) and time-domain
(Gundlach-Price-Pullin plus Prony) methods. We find that increasing either
$\ell$ or the ModMax parameter $\gamma$ enhances the real and imaginary parts
of QNMs, indicating higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping,
especially in the phantom sector. The effective potentials deepen under phantom
deformation, supporting more tightly bound modes. Furthermore, we analyze the
greybody factors and compute the sparsity $\eta$ of Hawking radiation, which
quantifies the nonthermal character of particle emission. We show that $\eta$
is significantly affected by $\ell$, decreasing with increasing Lorentz
violation and asymptotically approaching a scaled version of the Schwarzschild
value.

Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of noncommutative
geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal
configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy
distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the
classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ
a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue
problem for scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations. Our
results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without
oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes.
Additionally, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild
values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our
findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and noncommutative effects on black
hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for
distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.

Abstract: We investigate a static traversable wormhole sustained by a combination of a
minimally coupled scalar field and an electric field, with exotic matter
sourced by Casimir energy. Considering two scenarios, where the Casimir plate
separation is either radially variable or fixed, we derive analytical
near-throat solutions for both massless and massive scalar fields. To ensure
consistency of the field equations, a thermal tensor is also incorporated,
consisting solely of pressure terms that vanish at the throat. In all cases, we
obtain well-behaved wormhole manifolds with throat sizes that scale
proportionally with the number of elementary charges the wormhole can support.

Abstract: Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA represents the next frontier in

laser beams exchanged between the spacecraft Timedelay interferometric ranging
TDIR was proposed as a simpler alternative LTT estimation method TDIR LTT
estimates are chosen to minimize the TDI residual noise over the full LISA
frequency band TDIR can be used in case of PRN failure or to calibrate the
biases of the PRN method In this study we introduce modulationassisted TDIR
MATDIR an enhanced variant of TDIR that significantly improves LTT estimation
precision and resilience MATDIR achieves this by modulating the laser phase at
specific frequencies close to 1Hz thereby artificially elevating the laser
phase content relative to secondary unsuppressed noises This modulation
strategy not only enhances the signaltonoise ratio for TDIR but also mitigates
the impact of GW signals and instrumental artifacts enabling more reliable LTT
estimates with reduced integration times We develop the theoretical framework
of MATDIR incorporating the full constellation of three spacecraft laser
locking and multiple Michelson TDI combinations Analytical predictions
confirmed by numerical simulations indicate that MATDIR can achieve LTT
estimates comparable to the 1mrms at fs 4 Hz of the PRNbased baseline method We
therefore suggest that the possibility to modulate lasers is added to the laser
system requirements of LISA

Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry may open an alternative route to quantum
gravity. We study the influence of the spacetime noncommutativity on the Dirac
quasinormal modes in the modified Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime.
The framework for the latter study is provided by a certain effective model of
gravity coupled to fermions which in itself encapsulates noncommutative
deformation. This model describes a classical Dirac field coupled to a modified
Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry where the corresponding metric acquires an
additional nonvanishing $r-\varphi $ component. As the earlier study shows,
this model appears to be equivalent to a model of semiclassical NC gauge theory
in which a NC gauge field is being coupled to a NC fermion field on the one
side and the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om background on the other. In
comparison to the undeformed model where the Dirac field is coupled to the
commutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, the numerical results show that
the oscillation frequencies and magnitude of damping of the Dirac quasinormal
modes change to an extent that cannot be neglected. In fact, the influence of
spacetime noncommutativity is shown to produce features reminiscent of a
Zeeman-like splitting in the effective potential and quasinormal-mode spectrum.

Abstract: We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its
dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static
metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard
(general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian
constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form
in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms.
Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain
its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A
particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular
black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical
theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide
class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their
corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly
couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields
on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole
model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.

Abstract: We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron
star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses
and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical
relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems
(including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range,
regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart
from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the
postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that
the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and
oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending
on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them
greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the
distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black
hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will
be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal
effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \emph{reduced tidal
deformability} $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to
a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$
can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the
distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the
possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron
stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.

Abstract: Spinwave filters using single-crystal yttrium iron garnet are an attractive
technology for integration in frequency adjustable or tunable communication
systems. However, existing SW devices do not have sufficient bandwidth for
future 5G and 6G communication systems, are too large, or have strong spurious
passbands creating unintentional cross-channel interference. Leveraging modern
micromachining fabrication methods capable of wafer-scale production, we report
a SW ladder filter architecture requiring only a single external magnetic bias.
The filters demonstrate loss as low as 2.54 dB, bandwidths up to 663 MHz,
center frequency tuning over multiple octaves from 5.7-21.6 GHz, and high
linearity with an input referred third-order intercept point over 11 dBm in the
passband. The filter's operation is also experimentally demonstrated in a
frequency tunable radio system.

Abstract: Silicon photonics has thrived in telecommunications over recent decades, and
its extension to the mid-infrared range has the potential to unlock valuable
opportunities for sensing, imaging, and free-space communications. With this
perspective, germanium-tin (GeSn) alloy has been extensively investigated as a
silicon-compatible semiconductor with bandgap tunability that covers this
entire spectral range. Indeed, a variety of GeSn-based high-performance
optoelectronic devices have been demonstrated, confirming the potential of this
system for mid-infrared applications. However, the integration of these devices
onto silicon photonic platforms remains underexplored. Herein, we demonstrate
the fabrication and integration, through transfer-printing, of strain-relaxed
GeSn membranes onto silicon-on-insulator waveguides to create integrated
detectors operating up to 3.1 $\mu$m at room temperature. Two different designs
of waveguide structures are evaluated to study the coupling efficiency between
the passive structures and the active membrane detector. A responsivity
reaching 0.36 A/W at an operation wavelength of 2.33 $\mu$m is measured under a
bias of 1 V. Moreover, the fabrication resulted in multiple working devices
exhibiting similar performance using a single transfer printing step,
demonstrating the scalability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Imaging of the human body at ultra-high fields (static magnetic field B0>7
Tesla) is challenging due to the radio-frequency field inhomogeneities in the
human body tissues caused by the short wavelength. These effects could be
partially mitigated using an array of antennas and by parallel transmission
allowing for control of the radio-frequency field distribution in the region of
interest. All commonly-used radio-frequency arrays for ultra-high field MRI
consist of resonant elements: dipoles, TEM-resonators, loops and individual
slots. All these elements rely on standing wave excitation, in the sense that
they are resonant devices that produce a field pattern with a constant phase
distribution along the commensurable conductor elements. However, it was shown
previously, that a non-uniform phase of surface current is required to reach
the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio or a maximized signal in the
desired region of interest. In our work we propose to use a previously
demonstrated non-resonant leaky-wave approach to control the phase of currents
in radio-frequency coil conductors to increase the B1+ field in the center or
in the region of interest. Using this approach, we developed a radio-frequency
coil based on a leaky-wave antenna approach with optimized surface current
distribution resulting in stronger B1+ in the desired region compared to e.g. a
fractionated dipole.

Abstract: Magneto-transport properties in hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)
integrating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as tunnel barriers are critically
influenced by spinterface effects, which arise from the electronic properties
at ferromagnet (FM)/SAM interfaces. Understanding the mechanisms governing
spinterface formation in well-controlled model systems is essential for the
rational design of efficient molecular spintronic devices. However, the
fabrication of FM/SAM/FM systems remains a significant challenge due to the
difficulty in preventing electrical shorts through the SAM tunnel barrier
during top FM electrode deposition. In this study, we address these challenges
by developing model hybrid MTJs incorporating alkanethiol SAM tunnel barriers
grafted under ultra-high vacuum conditions onto single-crystalline Fe(001)
bottom electrodes. A soft-landing deposition method is used for the deposition
of a top Co FM electrode. The deposition process and the electronic properties
of the FM/SAM interfaces are first studied by spatially integrated X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, ballistic electron emission microscopy
(BEEM) and spectroscopy are used to investigate the lateral homogeneity of the
organic barrier. Optimal soft-landing deposition conditions allows the
preparation of homogeneous Co/SAM interfaces with no evidence of metal
diffusion through the SAM at the nanoscale. These observations are further
confirmed at the micron-scale by the high-yield patterning of large area
(5*5um2) MTJs presenting fingerprints of electron tunneling through the SAM.
These findings provide critical insights into the fabrication and optimization
of molecular spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in hybrid MTJ
technology.
