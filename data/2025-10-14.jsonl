Not nearly enough attention is given to understanding the\nmodels' robustness, especially when the test data are systematically different\nfrom the training data, or \"out of domain.\" Domain shift poses a significant\nchallenge for simulation-based inference, where models are trained on simulated\ndata but applied to real observational data. In this paper, we explore domain\nshift and test domain adaptation methods for a specific scientific case:\nsimulation-based inference for estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray\nprofiles. We build datasets to mimic simulation-based inference: a training set\nfrom the Magneticum simulation, a scatter-augmented training set to capture\nuncertainties in scaling relations, and a test set derived from the\nIllustrisTNG simulation. We demonstrate that the Test Set is out of domain in\nsubtle ways that would be difficult to detect without careful analysis. We\napply three deep learning methods: a standard neural network (NN), a neural\nnetwork trained on the scatter-augmented input catalogs, and a Deep\nReconstruction-Regression Network (DRRN), a semi-supervised deep model\nengineered to address domain shift. Although the NN improves results by 17% in\nthe Training Data, it performs 40% worse on the out-of-domain Test Set.\nSurprisingly, the Scatter-Augmented Neural Network (SANN) performs similarly.\nWhile the DRRN is successful in mapping the training and Test Data onto the\nsame latent space, it consistently underperforms compared to a straightforward\nYx scaling relation. These results serve as a warning that simulation-based\ninference must be handled with extreme care, as subtle differences between\ntraining simulations and observational data can lead to unforeseen biases\ncreeping into the results."}

Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and\nhybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial,\nphysics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following\nthe long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical\ntimestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating\nsimulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling\nthis in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then\nprojected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming\nin and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is\nmodulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch\nfactor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches\n(including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and\nensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and\nderive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to\nensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different\nphysics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes\nit possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear\nscale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is\nflexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and\nlimitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these\nmethods and physical time dilation in GRMHD.

The memory is most\naffected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic\nfield. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant\nimpact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave\nluminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the\nunstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of\nangular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic\ncontribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational\nwave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller\nthan that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary.

The potential production of\nTerbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly\ndiscussed."}

We examine\nhow neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data\nanalytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities\nthrough encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential\nequations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond\ntraining data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in\nbillions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and\nexpensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

The\noptimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse\nenergy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal\nfiltering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A\ndetailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and\nDense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs\nunderestimate the energy.

The deviations from the standard energy density of the\nradiative plasma are therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4\nnuclei. Upper limits on the free parameters of the spacetime noncommutativity\nare obtained via a numerical analysis performed using the \\texttt{PRyMordial}\nsoftware package. The primordial abundances of the light elements are obtained\nby evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rates for the considered\nnoncommutative spacetime models. An MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis\nallows to obtain restrictions on the free parameters of the modified dispersion\nrelations. The numerical and statistical approach is implemented in the python\ncode \\texttt{PRyNCe}, available on GitHub."}

Current methods in NR have shown progress towards producing stable\nsimulations reaching mass ratios of 1:100; however, the computational cost\nbecomes prohibitively expensive as the mass ratio and the length of the\nsimulation increases. Meanwhile, the gravitational self-force (GSF) community\nhas developed waveform models that not only generate extreme mass ratio\ninspiral waveforms, but also generate near-equal-mass-ratio waveforms with high\nfidelity. To assess the limits of both the GSF and NR waveforms and alleviate\nthe computational costs of NR, we present hybridized GSF-NR waveforms for\nnon-spinning binary black hole systems in which GSF provides the inspiral, and\nNR the merger and ringdown. The hybrid waveforms are generated from a set of 68\nnon-spinning NR waveforms from the SXS catalogue with mass ratios spanning 1:1\nto 1:20 and include the (2,2), (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4), (4,3), and (5,5)\nspin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. In this paper, we will highlight a\nselection of these hybrid waveforms and examine the error in the hybridization\nprocedure. We will investigate the impact of subdominant modes on the accuracy\nof the hybrid waveforms by performing mismatch comparisons with surrogate\nmodels. To address the feasibility of hybridizing GSF inspirals with short,\nhigh-mass ratio NR waveforms, thereby alleviating computational costs, we will\ndiscuss the relationship between mass ratio and the placement of the matching\nwindow, which can be used to predict the necessary and optimal number of NR\ncycles that contribute to the hybrid waveform."}
