However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be\nbased on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy.

LISA data is\nexpected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable\nGalactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in\nsatellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic\nstellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these\nastrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds\nof cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of\neach SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are\nexpected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for\nspectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible,\nGPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary\ncombinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities\nto demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic\nforeground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic\nstellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits\non the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence\nof multiple astrophysical foregrounds."}

PhD thesis", "summary": "In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic\nlimitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed\ncan be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general\nrelativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a\nbubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with\nsuperluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as\nnonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,\nrecent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not\nalways be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field\nequations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central\npremise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the\nmore common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for\ngenerating superluminal velocities, or \\textit{warp speeds}, through a warped\nregion in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:\ndust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,\ncharged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.\n  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described\nby a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation\npurely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely\nrelated to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock\nwaves."}

We now\ndemonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are\nused to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The\nmethodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two\ndifferent positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known\norientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of\nmeasuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their\nenvironment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of\nhidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer\nto make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it\nis to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working\nsimultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of\na fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are\nsafely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections.

The event horizon, photon\nsphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the\nSchwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the\nEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter\nranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum\ncorrection of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole\nshadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of\nmagnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated\nintensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the\nspherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion\ndisk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and\nthe contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,\nthe photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are\nnarrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider.

We identify two\nnon-trivial physically distinct classes of background conditions of Generalized\nProca theory within the assumption of asymptotic flatness: a Lorentz-invariant\nbut massive case, and a Lorentz-violating, massless case.

By varying the coupling parameter $\\alpha_1$, the\ncorresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures,\nincluding naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We\nfind that for sufficiently small $\\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes\nnon-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,\nwhile in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the\nnon-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier\nstructure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and\nmultiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number\n$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are\ntopologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds\nunity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the\nstandard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct\nbound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity\nbehavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing\nenergy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity\nand a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous\nstudies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast,\nmonotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit,\nand a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings.\nOur results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in\ndetermining the orbital structure around dyonic black holes."}

The forward modelling of observations,\nin particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological\nsimulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to\naccount for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,\nthe non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when\nobservables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us\nfrom high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run\ncosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent\nboundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved\nspacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free\nexpansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,\nallowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved\npatch.

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$."}

In this paper, we demonstrate a resolution of the\nSchwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter singularity by imposing unitary evolution with\nrespect to unimodular time. Employing the Henneaux-Teitelboim formulation of\nunimodular gravity, we perform a canonical quantization on a symmetry-reduced\nSchwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter model. This leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nthat effectively becomes a Schr\\\"odinger equation in unimodular time. By\nimposing unitarity, we discover a family of quantum theories in which the\nclassical singularity is resolved. These theories each allow only semiclassical\nstates corresponding to one mass sign: either positive, negative, or zero.\nFurthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the quantum-corrected\nSchwarzschild metric, which is modified by a new length scale $r_{min}$ that\ngoverns the black hole's transition to a white hole."}

The resulting images,\nincluding both redshift and intensity maps, are analyzed. The results show that\nthe scalar field parameters play a significant role in shaping both the direct\nand secondary images of the disk, while the inclination angle primarily affects\nthe asymmetry and brightness distribution. In particular, configurations with\nextreme scalar field values lead to cooler and dimmer disk compared to General\nRelativity. Furthermore, the structure and angular size of the secondary ring\nexhibit noticeable deviations from General Relativity, offering a potential\nobservational signature. Through direct comparison between hybrid\nmetric-Palatini gravity and General Relativity images, we conclude that future\nhigh-resolution observations of black hole shadows could effectively\ndistinguish this modified gravitational theory and constrain underlying scalar\nfield parameters."}

This work\nsystematically investigates quasinormal modes and gravitational echoes from\nscalar perturbations in a thick brane model exhibiting internal structure and\nbrane splitting. Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein\nspectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different\nparameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective\npotentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals\nfor split brane configurations ($s > 1, \\delta > 1$), produced by successive\nreflections between sub-branes. A key finding is the position-dependence of\necho modes within the extra dimension: observers located on a sub-brane detect\nclean periodic signals, whereas those situated between sub-branes observe more\ncomplex, modulated waveforms. This effect offers a distinct signature of the\nbrane's internal structure. The observed echoes, along with consistent\nfrequency- and time-domain results, advance the understanding of thick brane\ndynamics and open an observational window into warped extra dimensions.\nMoreover, the similarity between the effective potential in thick brane\nscenarios and those of black holes and wormholes offers valuable perspectives\nfor studying echo-related phenomena in these gravitational systems."}

Keeble", "Frans Pretorius"], "title": "First-Order Viscous Relativistic Hydrodynamics on the Two-Sphere", "comment": "16 + 12 pages, 19 figures", "summary": "A few years ago, Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) formulated the\nfirst causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and locally well-posed theory of\nfirst-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. Since their inception, there\nhave been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which\nhave revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,\nfirst-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended\nto include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D\nsimulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications."}

Of these, some will be\ncharacterizable as individual deterministic signals; the remainder will overlap\nto create astrophysical confusion noise. These sources of confusion noise are\nknown as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). LISA data is\nexpected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable\nGalactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in\nsatellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic\nstellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these\nastrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds\nof cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of\neach SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are\nexpected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for\nspectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible,\nGPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary\ncombinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities\nto demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic\nforeground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic\nstellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits\non the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence\nof multiple astrophysical foregrounds."}
