HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability.\n  Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds.\n  HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u767d\u76ae\u4e66\u4e3b\u5f20\u5728Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e91\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u53cd\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "HWO\u4f5c\u4e3a2040\u5e74\u4ee3\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7c7b\u5730\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cd\u5c04\u901a\u91cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u4e91\u5c42\u7279\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u884c\u661f\u53ef\u5c45\u4f4f\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728HWO\u4eea\u5668\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff08\u6d4b\u91cf\u53cd\u5c04\u5149\u968f\u6ce2\u957f\u548c\u8f68\u9053\u76f8\u4f4d\u7684\u504f\u632f\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u504f\u632f\u5bf9\u4e91\u7c92\u5b50\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u6210\u5206\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7c7b\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002", "result": "\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u6253\u7834\u5927\u6c14\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b80\u5e76\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u70ed\u6728\u661f\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u53ef\u5c45\u4f4f\u7684\u8f83\u51b7\u884c\u661f\u7b49\u5404\u79cd\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002HWO\u7684\u4eea\u5668\u5957\u4ef6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65e5\u5195\u4eea\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6210\u50cf\u4eea\u548c\u5019\u9009\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5149\u8c31\u504f\u632f\u8ba1\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728HWO\u4eea\u5668\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u79d1\u5b66\u56de\u62a5\u3002\u82f1\u56fd\u5728\u4eea\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u9886\u5bfc\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5e94\u79ef\u6781\u53c2\u4e0e\u5851\u9020HWO\u7684\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5176\u5bf9\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This paper describes characterization of DESHIMA 2.0 in laboratory settings. The instrument features NbTiN superconducting microstrip (MS) filters with low-loss a-SiC:H dielectric and an ultra-wideband leaky-wave antenna. A laboratory setup was designed, incorporating the cryostat housing cryogenic optics and ISS chip comprising 339 KIDs connected to MS filters tuned for (sub-)mm wave frequencies. Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements. The sky-position chopper was positioned on a motor-controlled stage for fine-tuned control over its position and alignment. Thanks to the multiplexing capability of KIDs, we could simultaneously measure multiple performance metrics across the entire frequency range. We showed that DESHIMA 2.0 achieved significant improvements in performance compared to its predecessor (DESHIMA 1.0): measured instantaneous frequency coverage was 200$-$400 GHz with a mean filter $Q_{filter}$ of $340 \\pm 50$; instrument efficiency reached $\\sim8$ \\%, indicating 4 times wider band coverage and 4 times higher sensitivity. The yield rate for MS filters exceeded 98 \\%. The estimated aperture efficiency from measured beam patterns agreed well with the designed value of approximately 70 \\%.

Knuth"], "title": "Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent studies by B. Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86Villarroel\u7b49\u4eba\u5173\u4e8ePOSS1\u5e95\u7247\u4e2d\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8bba\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u7403\u9634\u5f71\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u661f\u7fa4\u5305\u542b\u5df2\u77e5\u6052\u661f\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u3002", "motivation": "Villarroel\u7b49\u4eba\u57fa\u4e8ePOSS1\u5e95\u7247\u626b\u63cf\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5f15\u4eba\u6ce8\u76ee\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5730\u7403\u9634\u5f71\u5185\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u661f\u7fa4\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u89c2\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6838\u8bd5\u9a8c/UAP\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u5730\u4eba\u9020\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e3b\u5f20\u8fdb\u884c\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5df2\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf9\u6700\u4e25\u683c\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5730\u7403\u9634\u5f71\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u9a8c\uff1b\u5bf9\u7ebf\u6027\u661f\u7fa4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6052\u661f\u76ee\u5f55\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff1b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5929\u6570\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6392\u9664\u626b\u63cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u5e95\u7247\u7f3a\u9677\u3001\u5df2\u77e5\u6052\u661f\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728\u6700\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u672a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5730\u7403\u9634\u5f71\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b2) \u7ebf\u6027\u661f\u7fa4\u4e2d\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u6052\u661f\u533a\u5206\uff1b3) \u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5728\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u540e\u4e0d\u518d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5e15\u6d1b\u739b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u8ba1\u5212\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b4) \u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u672a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\uff1b5) \u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u663e\u793a\u5411\u5e95\u7247\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u89d2\u843d\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5357\u5317\u5411\u7a7a\u767d\u5e26\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u661f\u7fa4\u548c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "Villarroel\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u5747\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u8fd1\u5730\u4eba\u9020\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u626b\u63cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u6216\u5e95\u7247\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u77ac\u53d8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this formulation, the cosmological conformal factor is not a propagating degree of freedom but a global gauge variable fixed by the Hamiltonian constraint, rendering the conventional conformal-factor problem inapplicable. Thermal equilibrium at cosmological turning points uniquely fixes the equilibrium phase density ($\u039b=R/6$) as the integrating factor that renders the horizon Clausius relation exact. Controlled departures from equilibrium are encoded by a single variance parameter governing non-adiabatic background evolution. The resulting framework clarifies the conceptual status of $\u039b$CDM, explains the emergence of effective $w$CDM behavior--including phantom regimes without new degrees of freedom--and provides a natural origin for late-time cosmological tensions, arising from global constraints that preclude a stable de Sitter state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7531\u9a6c\u8d6b\u76f8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7531\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u754c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5171\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u039bCDM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\u9700\u8981\u6f84\u6e05\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u8d6b\u539f\u7406\u548c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u6548wCDM\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5e7b\u8c61\u533a\u57df\uff09\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5f20\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9a6c\u8d6b\u76f8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5b87\u5b99\u5171\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u89c6\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u89c4\u8303\u53d8\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u64ad\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u7531\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ea6\u675f\u56fa\u5b9a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u89c6\u754c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u786e\u5b9a\u70ed\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u76f8\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08\u039b=R/6\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79ef\u5206\u56e0\u5b50\u4f7f\u89c6\u754c\u514b\u52b3\u4fee\u65af\u5173\u7cfb\u7cbe\u786e\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u5dee\u53c2\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u975e\u7edd\u70ed\u80cc\u666f\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u039bCDM\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6709\u6548wCDM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u5e7b\u8c61\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u5f20\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8d77\u6e90\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f20\u529b\u6e90\u4e8e\u963b\u6b62\u7a33\u5b9a\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u6001\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b87\u5b99\u81a8\u80c0\u7531\u9a6c\u8d6b\u76f8\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u8def\u5f84\u79ef\u5206\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5171\u5f62\u56e0\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u039bCDM\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u6982\u5ff5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u665a\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5fb7\u897f\u7279\u6001\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}}

Williams"], "title": "Leveraging rapid parameter estimates for efficient gravitational-wave Bayesian inference via posterior repartitioning", "comment": "22 pages, 17 figures. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses. Several methods have been developed to perform rapid Bayesian inference, but they are not yet used to inform our full analyses. We present a novel approach for doing this whilst ensuring that the Bayesian prior remains independent of the data, providing a statistically rigorous way to leverage low-latency information to accelerate the final inference. By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fe1\u606f\u52a0\u901f\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408simple-pe\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u91cd\u5206\u533a\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u91c7\u6837\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.2\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4f9d\u8d56\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fe1\u606f\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408simple-pe\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u91cd\u5206\u533a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5d4c\u5957\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6570\u5b66\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5927\u4e8e20\u65f6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5c0f\u4e8e150\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe2.2\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u968f\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6210\u672c\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOCCAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5f3a\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOCCAM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u641c\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u81f4\u5bc6\u53cc\u661f\u5e76\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e94\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5c0f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5019\u9009", "result": "\u5728LIGO\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b097%\uff0880%\uff09\u7684\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\uff0c\u914d\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u7ea613%\uff087%\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5929\u7a7a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387", "conclusion": "OCCAM\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ec9\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u4ece\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e9a\u9608\u503c\u5019\u9009\uff09\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u900f\u955c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u884c\u6027"}}

In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\u03bb(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \\to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent.

As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u632f\u5e45\u4e0d\u53d8\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6216\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f-\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u4f4e\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u6f6e\u6c50\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6f6e\u6c50\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5355\u9891\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u6f6e\u6c50\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53cc\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u6216\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f-\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u8f68\u9053\u9891\u7387\u626b\u8fc7\u5171\u632f\u6a21\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u6f6e\u6c50\u529b\u6fc0\u53d1\u6052\u661f\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8017\u6563\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u51c6\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2\uff09\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u503c\u5339\u914d\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7248\u672c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5931\u914d\u5ea6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LVK\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a1\u6beb\u79d2\u4e14\u8fc7\u5269\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u4e3a\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u767e\u5206\u4e4b\u51e0\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a2\u6d4b\u5230\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u6f6e\u6c50\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f6e\u6c50\u5171\u632f\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5408\u5e76\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4f4d\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5355\u9891\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4f30\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LVK\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u524d\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u4e14\u80fd\u91cf\u901a\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u4e3a\u767e\u5206\u4e4b\u51e0\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u88ab\u63a2\u6d4b\u3002"}}

[Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6da8\u843d\u963b\u6b62\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56db\u6781\u77e9\u7269\u4f53\u8981\u6c42\u5f15\u529b\u8f90\u5c04\u91cf\u5b50\u5316", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790Belenchia\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u725b\u987f\u573a\u53e0\u52a0\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7528\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u725b\u987f\u6f6e\u6c50\u573a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u8be5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u6269\u5c55\u56db\u6781\u77e9\u7269\u4f53\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u725b\u987f\u6f6e\u6c50\u573a\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u56db\u6781\u77e9\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6da8\u843d\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u8d85\u5149\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u9012\u3002\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u5f15\u529b\u8f90\u5c04\u5fc5\u987b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6ce2\u6e90\u6765\u81ea\u5f3a\u5f15\u529b\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5728\u725b\u987f\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5fc5\u987b\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

Oikonomou"], "title": "$\\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Tachyon Scalar Field Inflation, the ACT Data, and Phantom Transition", "comment": null, "summary": "Phantom divide line transitions are not possible in the context of single scalar field scalar-tensor theories. In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim \u03bb\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16\u03c0G}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}\u03bb$.

In this work, we obtain the complete analytic solution of the Mathisson--Papapetrou--Dixon equations at linear order in the spin for a general plane gravitational wave with arbitrary polarization profiles. Our approach combines a parallel-transported tetrad with the translational Killing symmetries of plane wave spacetimes, yielding six conserved quantities that fully determine the momentum, spin evolution, and worldline. The resulting transverse and longitudinal motions are expressed in closed form as single integrals of the retarded time, providing a unified and model-independent framework for computing spin--curvature-induced deviations for realistic or theoretical gravitational-wave signals.

Livine"], "title": "Elementary blocks of Loop Quantum Gravity", "comment": "31 pages", "summary": "We embark on the vast program of integrating the dynamics of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). Adopting the strategy of decomposing spin network states into small blocks of (quantum) geometry which can later be glued back together, we focus on the more modest objective of studying the Hamiltonian dynamics on the {\\it candy graph}, that is two nodes linked together by an arbitrary number of edges and also having open edges. This elementary setting allows both for curvature to develop around the bulk loops and both non-trivial boundary data and dynamics on the open edges. We study this system at the classical level and leave the detailed of its quantum regime for future investigation. Working on a single loop with two external legs, we show how the LQG Hamiltonian ansatz reduces to a pair of non-linear differential equations, similar to the cubic Schr\u00f6dinger equation, on the areas carried by the bulk links. We provide analytical solutions to this evolution equation, identifying oscillatory modes (bounded modes) and divergent modes (similar to bouncing cosmological trajectories). This provides an explicit template for future investigations of LQG dynamics on more sophisticated spin network architecture built as arrays of candy graphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76Loop Quantum Gravity\uff08LQG\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5757\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\"\u7cd6\u679c\u56fe\"\uff08\u4e24\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u8fb9\u8fde\u63a5\u4e14\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "LQG\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6574\u5408\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e9e\u5927\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5757\u91cf\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u540e\u518d\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u9002\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u7cd6\u679c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u65e2\u5141\u8bb8\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u66f2\u7387\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u53c8\u5141\u8bb8\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8fb9\u754c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c06\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5757\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7cd6\u679c\u56fe\uff08\u4e24\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u8fb9\u8fde\u63a5\u4e14\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8fb9\uff09\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6c34\u5e73\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5728\u5355\u5faa\u73af\u5e26\u4e24\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u817f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c55\u793aLQG\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7acb\u65b9\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6709\u754c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u53d1\u6563\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u53cd\u5f39\u5b87\u5b99\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cd6\u679c\u56fe\u9635\u5217\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76LQG\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cd6\u679c\u56fe\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76LQG\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u4f46\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u66f2\u7387\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u7684\u83b7\u5f97\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u65cb\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u7814\u7a76\u7559\u5f85\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations.

These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $\u039b$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $\u039b$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b87\u5b99\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4f53\u6d41\uff08bulk flows\uff09\u589e\u957f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6df1\u90e8\u4f53\u6d41\uff0c\u800c\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u62a5\u544a\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f53\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u039bCDM\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f53\u6d41\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u8fd1\u671f\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u589e\u957f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b83\u4eec\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u5728\u725b\u987f\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u65e0\u6e90\u9879\u5230\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u725b\u987f\u3001\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u53d8\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f53\u6d41\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387\u8fdc\u5f3a\u4e8e\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684v\u221dt^{1/3}\u589e\u957f\u3002\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7269\u8d28\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u80fd\uff08\u5947\u7279\u901a\u91cf\uff09\u5bf9\u5f15\u529b\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u800c\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5219\u6ca1\u6709\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u725b\u987f\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u589e\u957f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u4f53\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5f97\u5230\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6311\u6218\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u725b\u987f\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f53\u6d41\u589e\u957f\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8c03\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

Our framework introduces scattering maps prescribed on two classes of hypersurfaces: a gravitational singularity hypersurface and a fluid-discontinuity hypersurface. By analyzing the causal structures induced by the light cone and the acoustic cone, we formulate a local evolution problem for the Einstein-Euler system in the presence of such interfaces. We explain how suitable scattering relations must supplement the field equations in order to ensure uniqueness and thus yield a complete macroscopic description of the evolution. This viewpoint builds on a theory developed in collaboration with G. Veneziano for quiescent (velocity-dominated) singularities in solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a scalar field, where the passage across the singular hypersurface is encoded by a singularity scattering map. The guiding question is to identify junction prescriptions that are compatible with the Einstein and Euler equations, in particular with the propagation of constraints. The outcome is a rigid set of universal relations, together with a family of model-dependent parameters. Under physically motivated requirements (general covariance, causality, constraint compatibility, and ultra-locality), we aim to classify admissible scattering relations arising from microscopic physics and characterizing, at the macroscopic level, the dynamics of a fluid coupled to Einstein gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u76f8\u53d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u53cd\u5f39\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u5f15\u529b\u5947\u70b9\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u53d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u53cd\u5f39\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u5f15\u529b\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u76f8\u53d8\u65f6\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u5947\u70b9\u6216\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u754c\u9762\u5904\u5b9e\u73b0\u552f\u4e00\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u7c7b\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u6620\u5c04\uff1a\u5f15\u529b\u5947\u70b9\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u548c\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5149\u9525\u548c\u58f0\u9525\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766-\u6b27\u62c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5236\u5b9a\u5c40\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7269\u7406\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u534f\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u8d85\u5c40\u57df\u6027\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u521a\u6027\u666e\u9002\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u53c2\u6570\u65cf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4ece\u5fae\u89c2\u7269\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u53ef\u5bb9\u8bb8\u6563\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u8865\u5145\u573a\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5947\u70b9\u6216\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u754c\u9762\u5904\u786e\u4fdd\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u6d41\u4f53\u4e0e\u7231\u56e0\u65af\u5766\u5f15\u529b\u8026\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

We analyze the algebraic structure, finding the spacetime to be generically of Petrov type I, and investigate the equatorial dynamics of charged test particles and photons. Our analysis reveals that the external magnetic field $b$ induces a ``Lorentz shift'' in the effective angular momentum, suppressing the potential barrier and causing the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) to migrate inward.

Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\u03b4(t_\\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V} \\gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\u03b4(t_\\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\u03b4_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\u03b4_c(t_\\mathrm{H}) \\sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal.

We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u975e\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u7403\u9762\u5206\u89e3\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u3001\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u62d6\u5c3e\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u94c3\u8361\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce2\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5e76\u5408\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u9891\u7387\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u652f\u5207\u5272\u79ef\u5206\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u62d6\u5c3e\uff09\u548c\u6781\u70b9\uff08\u5bf9\u5e94\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u6765\u5206\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u65f6\u57dfRegge-Wheeler\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u5206\u3001\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u62d6\u5c3e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5c0f\u5b87\u5b99\u5e38\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b8c\u6574\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5206\u6790\u53cc\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5e76\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u94c3\u8361\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}
