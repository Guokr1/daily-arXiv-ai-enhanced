This map is expressed in terms of an enhancement function of the eccentricity, which is appropriately resummed to ensure accuracy for any eccentricity; in particular, I recover known results for circular orbits. In order to obtain this map, the local dynamics are expressed using an action-angle formulation. The tail term is treated as a perturbation, which is first localized in time, then Delaunay-averaged. Both operations require a contact transformation of the phase-space variables, which I explicitly control. Using the first law of binary black hole mechanics, I then obtain the orbit-averaged redshift invariant for eccentric orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order; when properly accounting for the tail contributions, it perfectly agrees with analytical self-force at postgeodesic order [arXiv:2203.13832]. Finally, I use these results to re-express the fluxes of energy and angular momentum obtained at third post-Newtonian order in [arXiv:0711.0302] and [arXiv:0908.3854] in terms of fundamental frequencies."}

In this article, we study the stochastic Klein-Gordon equation as a starting point to understand the phenomenology of linearised classical-quantum hybrid gravity. In particular, we describe how to compute the non-equilibrium two point function of the scalar field, showing explicitly the role of the initial state in regulating divergences. To do so, we use a \"mod-squared-retarded\" pole-prescription and find that the covariance in the field is non-zero only outside the lightcone, scales inversely with the spatial distance of the spacetime points and grows linearly in time. The energy has a contact divergence similar to that found in the quantum case. We conclude by discussing possible implications of anomalous diffusion for hybrid theories of gravity, especially looking at the energy density in the predicted gravitational waves background, which can be inferred from the scalar covariances."}

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries."}

For large RISs, experimental MC estimation is fundamentally challenging because of the quadratic scaling of the number of unknowns with the number of RIS elements. In this Letter, we present a generic and flexible reduced-rank MC representation that allows wireless practitioners to choose a trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. We experimentally validate the direct reduced-rank MC estimation for a 100-element RIS in three radio environments (rich scattering, attenuated scattering, free space). We observe a strong environmental dependence of the influence of rank reduction on accuracy. Model-based performance evaluations highlight that the importance of MC awareness in optimization depends strongly on the radio environment and the performance indicator."}

The device is fabricated using lamination and UV lithography on a dry-film resist, eliminating the need for cleanroom facilities and simplifying production. Its multi-wavelength transparency was validated through UV-visible spectroscopy, where photoexcitation at different wavelengths induced reversible trans-to-cis isomerization of azobenzene and fluoro-azobenzene.

For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z~3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement.

Within this framework, we construct an isotropic and homogeneous metric analogous to the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric but without a universal speed limit. Two distinct solutions of the Einstein-like field equations are obtained: (i) a vacuum configuration ($λ=0$) yielding an exponential--quadratic scale factor, and (ii) a dust-dominated universe ($λ=1$) described by a non-interacting nonrelativistic fluid. Upon dimensional reduction to $3+1$ spacetime through a specific embedding, the model naturally develops anisotropy in the scale factor and density, consistent with the near-zero spatial curvature inferred from Planck data. In the case of vanishing spatial curvature, the framework reproduces Milne's Newtonian cosmology because this condition leads to a vanishing pressure. This provides an independent nonrelativistic setting for cosmological dynamics within Galilean covariance."}

Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a ~480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA)."}

The system successfully characterizes the surface figure and evaluates the dynamic stability of a 1-meter Hencky-type membrane mirror. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PMD as a practical metrology tool for future membrane-based telescope systems."}

Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable."}

After it is published, it will be found at https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi", "summary": "Small solar system bodies are becoming increasingly important as missions like NASA's OSIRIS-REx show. However, the study of the characteristics and behavior of these objects on Earth is a challenge as the simulation of their environmental conditions is difficult. We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS (\"Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity\") project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed."}

Existing analytic models often show large discrepancies with numerical relativity (NR) data, while data-driven models are limited to mass ratios of q<=8 (aligned spins) and q<=4 (precessing spins) and break down when extrapolated outside their training ranges. Using ~5000 of NR simulations from the SXS and RIT catalogs up to q=128 and ~100 black hole perturbation theory simulations up to q=200, we present two classes of models: (i) gwModel_kick_q200 (gwModel_kick_q200_GPR), an analytic (Gaussian process regression) model for aligned-spin binaries. (ii) gwModel_kick_prec_flow, a normalizing-flow model for kick distribution from precessing binaries with isotropic spins. Our approach combines analytic insights from post-Newtonian theory with data-driven techniques to ensure correct limiting behavior and high accuracy across parameter space. Both gwModel_kick_q200 and gwModel_kick_prec_flow are valid from comparable to extreme mass ratios. Extensive validation shows all three models outperform existing ones within their respective domains. Finally, using both back-of-the-envelope estimates and 1404 detailed star cluster simulations incorporating our kick models, we find that the black hole retention probability in low mass globular clusters can vary noticeably when the gwModel_kick_prec_flow model is employed. The models are publicly available through the gwModels package."}

Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II."}
