Conventional photoacoustic imaging methods have relied on pulsed lasers to induce the photoacoustic effect, coupled with arrays of pressure transducers to detect the resulting ultrasound signals. In this work, we propose an alternative all-optical approach that leverages optical deflection to record photoacoustic waves by an array of detection beams. The measured signal is shown to be the Radon transform of the pressure gradients. An optimization-based inversion procedure is used to reconstruct the initial time pressure gradient field. Subsequently, a Galerkin method is used to reconstruct the pressure field from the pressure gradient field. The new modality offers the potential for enhanced sensitivity and reduced signal distortion, advancing the capabilities of photoacoustic imaging beyond traditional transducer-based systems."}

This paper presents a framework for estimating contact points and robot localization in a known planar environment using a single whisker sensor. We develop a family of virtual sensor models. Each model maps robot configurations to sensor observations and enables structured reasoning through the concept of preimages - the set of robot states consistent with a given observation. The notion of virtual sensor models serves as an abstraction to reason about state uncertainty without dependence on physical implementation. By combining sensor observations with a motion model, we estimate the contact point. Iterative estimation then enables reconstruction of obstacle boundaries. Furthermore, intersecting states inferred from current observations with forward-projected states from previous steps allow accurate robot localization without relying on vision or external systems. The framework supports both deterministic and possibilistic formulations and is validated through simulation and physical experiments using a low-cost, 3D printed, Hall-effect-based whisker sensor. Results demonstrate accurate contact estimation and localization with errors under 7 mm, demonstrating the potential of whisker-based sensing as a lightweight, adaptable complement to vision-based navigation."}

This article proposes a method to improve the magnetron output characteristics based on regulating its anode current by a novel active distortion eliminator. It takes advantage of the constant current state of MOSFETs to suppress the anode current ripple and eliminate the magnetron output ripples. An improved switch-mode power supply is applied to a 1-kW commercial S -band magnetron in the experiment. The peak-to-peak anode current ripple is reduced from 31 to 7 mA. The spectral width of the free-running magnetron is decreased from 246 to 87 kHz. In the injection locking state, the spur noise is significantly reduced with a maximum suppression strength of 23 dB at a 100-Hz offset. The peak-to-peak value of the magnetron magnitude and phase jitter are suppressed to 15% and 16% of their original values at a power injection ratio of 0.13. This method provides a novel approach for stabilizing the output phase of an injection-locked magnetron, making it promising for applications in phased arrays, wireless power transfer, particle accelerators, large-power communication, and other scenarios that require high phase stability."}

For the sapphire-substrate sample, two conduction mechanisms are identified: Poole-Frenkel emission (PFE) and trap-assisted tunneling (TAT), with corresponding trap energy levels of 0.9 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively. In contrast, only PFE is observed in the GaN-substrate sample, with a trap energy of 0.75 eV, suggesting that the presence of TAT is related to the higher dislocation density in structures grown on sapphire substrates. The leakage mechanisms and associated trap energies are extracted by comparing experimental current-voltage (I-V) characteristics with a model that includes thermionic emission and tunneling contributions for different temperatures, from 298K up to 443K."}

However, our understanding of its cross section remains severely deficient, particularly below $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.5$\\,MeV, the energy range of interest for astrophysics. To address these unresolved issues, the LUNA collaboration will conduct a dedicated study of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction at the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility (Bellotti IBF) located deep underground within the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Based on the combination of passive and active shields, this campaign aims to achieve unprecedented sensitivity in measuring the cross sections of the two key reaction channels, $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$α$)$^{20}$Ne and $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$p$)$^{23}$Na in the low-energy regime via $γ$-ray detection. Here, we report on a sensitivity study for the upcoming campaign with a focus on the characterization of two detectors, namely a HPGe detector and a NaI(Tl) array. Furthermore, their intrinsic contamination is thoroughly investigated since this could potentially influence the overall sensitivity. Assuming typical beam intensities of the Bellotti IBF, we will be able to investigate reaction rates significantly below 100 counts per day. In case of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction we therefore expect to acquire experimental data well below the current limit of $E_\\textrm{cm}=2.1\\,$MeV. The results are supported by simulations to highlight the advantageous low-background environment, essential for high-precision nuclear astrophysics studies."}

We precisely calculate entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, accounting for perturbative thermal corrections. Our results reveal that the internal energy of small black holes diverges asymptotically due to these fluctuations. The corrected Gibbs free energy attains asymptotically high values for small horizon radii. In contrast, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy approaches zero. Additionally, we assess the stability of the black hole in the presence of these thermal fluctuations. We find that, in contrast to the equilibrium state, the thermal fluctuation introduces a double phase transition to the stability of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the influence of fluctuations is notably significant, primarily for small black holes. These findings offer new insights into the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes in the presence of thermal fluctuations."}

NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}

In liquid-argon time-projection chambers equipped with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), we show that improved optical readout, combined with a nuclear dielectric constant (NDC) correction to the WIMP nucleus interaction, enhances the response to low-momentum-transfer nuclear recoils. The NDC effectively amplifies the interaction strength at small recoil energies, increasing the expected ionization and scintillation yields without modifying the high-energy behavior constrained by calibration data. When coupled to SiPM based light collection, this mechanism lowers the effective detection threshold to the subKeV regime, significantly improving sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs and other weakly interacting particles. Complementarily, we present the design and projected performance of a qubit-based detector optimized for ultra-low-energy depositions. A novel two-chip architecture is employed to minimize signal dissipation, while quantum parity measurements enable enhanced single-phonon sensitivity. Full simulations of phonon propagation and quasiparticle dynamics demonstrate that energy deposits at the level of $\\gtrsim 30 meV$ can be detected with nearly unit efficiency and high energy resolution. This capability is expected to advance sensitivity to dark-matter scattering for masses $m_χ\\gtrsim 0.01 MeV$ by several orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and to enable competitive searches for axion and dark-photon absorption in the $0.04 - 0.2 eV$ mass range."}

However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system.

The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $ζ$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied.

Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean.

We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~σ$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole."}

Prototypes are produced for a Time Projection Chamber design for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay search experiment that meet requirements for ultra-high radiopurity, good mechanical, cryogenic and high voltage performance, as well as useful vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) reflectivity. Further study is warranted to refine production methods and to confirm that the technology used here is useful for more general applications."}

By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\\mathcal{L}\\propto R-λC^2+μR^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $γ(r)$ and $β(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $γ(r)\\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W>m_R/4$. The leading correction to $β(r)$ exhibiting a characteristic $\\mathcal{O}(r \\ln (r)e^{-mr})$ dependence. Based on the Solar System experiments, we derive preliminary constraints on the theory's parameters: $m_R,m_W\\gtrsim23~\\mathrm{AU}^{-1}$, corresponding to $λ\\lesssim2.1\\times10^{19}~\\mathrm{m}^2$ and $μ\\lesssim 7.1\\times 10^{18}~\\mathrm{m}^2$. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future tests of quadratic gravity using pulsar timing arrays, gravitational-wave observations, and laboratory-scale short-range gravity experiments."}

We investigate a class of coordinate singularities induced by such trapping (or apparent) horizons in a spherically symmetric, dynamic spacetime, which are distinct from the well-known coordinate singularities associated with the Killing horizon. In particular, we clarify the geometric structure of this coordinate singularity by means of the Kodama vector field, thereby avoiding unphysical artifacts. We further employ the evolving Ellis drainhole as an analytical model to illustrate key details of this phenomenon."}

Andrew"], "title": "Interpolated Topology Change in a Spin Cobordism and the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic", "comment": "21 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Topology change in Lorentzian quantum gravity demands geometric regulators that control curvature, spin structure, and chirality during nontrivial interpolations. We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations."}

MacMillan", "Lee P. McCuller"], "title": "Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\\infty$ Approach", "comment": null, "summary": "At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design."}
