Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to\nexplicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of\nspacetimes.

Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh\nrefinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully\nrecovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families\nof quasinormal modes: complex light-ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter\nmodes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the\nnotions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit\nunder consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a\ndestabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\\omega = 0$.

In our framework, gravitationally\ninduced adiabatic matter creation/annihilation are treated as irreversible\nprocesses, while energy exchange between the cosmic bulk and the horizon is\nmodeled as reversible. We propose two thermodynamic interacting scenarios with\nmatter creation/annihilation in which energy flows from matter and radiation\ncomponents to an effective entropic dark energy sector. In both scenarios,\neffective entropic dark energy initially exhibits properties akin to those of\nradiation and matter prior to recombination. Subsequently, it transitions into\na quintessence state, ultimately converging towards the cosmological constant\nin the current epoch. Our models predict Hubble constant values of $H_0 = 71.73\n\\pm 0.79 \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 71.06 \\pm\n0.79 \\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, which exhibit agreement\nwith the recent 2024 SH0ES measurement of $H_0 = 73.17 \\pm 0.86 \\text{km} \\,\n\\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at levels of $1.2\\sigma$ and $1.8\\sigma$.\nWhen compared to the 2022 SH0ES baseline measurement of $H_0 = 73.04 \\pm 1.04\n\\text{km} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, both models demonstrate\nconcordance at $1\\sigma$ and $1.5\\sigma$.

We start by\nderiving the exact black hole solutions within the framework of\nModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity and analyze how the parameters of both ModMax\nand dRGT-like massive gravity influence the characteristics of these black\nholes. Additionally, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities for these black\nholes in the non-extended phase space and investigate how the parameters of\nModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity affect these quantities. We confirm that\nthese quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We also examine local\nstability by analyzing heat capacity and assess how ModMax and the massive\nparameters influence phase transitions and physical limitation points. Next, we\nexpand our analysis to the extended phase space, demonstrating that these\nthermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law of thermodynamics and the\nSmarr relation in this context.

Employing the most\nrecent DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset along with previous\nBAO measurements, we constrain the model parameters through a robust Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We examine the background evolution via key\ncosmological indicators including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, deceleration\nparameter $q(z)$, the effective equation of state $\\omega_{\\rm eff}(z)$, and\nthe Om diagnostic. Our results indicate that the inclusion of DESI DR2 data\nsignificantly tightens constraints on the model parameters and supports a\nconsistent transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion. The\npresent-day values of $q(0)$ and $\\omega_{\\rm eff}(0)$ lie within the\nquintessence regime for all datasets. However, for lower redshift values the\nbehaviour varies between phantom-like and quintessence-like phases. Statistical\ncomparison via $\\chi^2$, AIC, BIC, and $R^2$ further demonstrate that both CPL\n+ $f(Q)$ and BA + $f(Q)$ provide better or competitive fits to data compared to\n$\\Lambda$CDM, hence offering a compelling geometric alternative for explaining\nlate-time cosmic acceleration."}

By reformulating Einstein's equations in two dimensions as a Poisson\nequation for the conformal factor, we analyze how smooth defect densities --\nsuch as Gaussian, exponential, and power-law profiles -- regularize curvature\nsingularities and encode nontrivial topological information. Each distribution\nyields a well-defined geometry that interpolates between localized curvature\nnear the defect core and asymptotic flatness. We compute the Ricci scalar and\ntotal curvature, confirming consistency with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

In search of theoretically well-motivated Proca star models,\nwe recently introduced the $\\ell$-Proca star, a multi-field extension of the\nspherical Proca star, whose $(2\\ell + 1)$ constitutive fields have the same\ntime and radial dependence, and their angular structure is given by all the\navailable spherical harmonics for a fixed angular momentum number $\\ell$. In\nthis work, we conduct a non-linear stability analysis of these stars by\nnumerically solving the Einstein-(multi, complex) Proca system for the case of\n$\\ell = 2$, which are formed by five constitutive independent, complex Proca\nfields with $m = 0, |1|$, and $|2|$. Our analysis is based on long-term, fully\nnon-linear, 3-dimensional numerical-relativity simulations without imposing any\nsymmetry. We find that ($\\ell=2$)-Proca stars are unstable throughout their\nentire domain of existence. In particular, we highlight that less compact\nconfigurations dynamically lose their global spherical symmetry, developing a\nnon-axisymmetric $\\tilde{m}=4$ mode instability and a subsequent migration into\na new kind of multi-field Proca star formed by fields with different angular\nmomentum number, $\\ell=1$ and $\\ell=2$, that we identify as unstable\nmulti-$\\ell$ Proca stars."}
