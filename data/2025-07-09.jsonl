Dark energy is contributed from both holographic\nvacuum energy and the NMC scalar field. NMC effective gravitational constant\n$G_\\text{eff}(\\phi)$, is naturally defined at the action level. Therefore, the\ngravitational constant in the holographic vacuum density is an effective one,\ni.e. $ \\rho_{\\Lambda} = {3c^{2}}/{8\\pi G_{\\text{eff}}L^{2}}\\,. $ Apparent\nhorizon is chosen as IR holographic cutoff scale as it is a trapped null\nsurface. There are nine fixed points in this dynamical system with four\nindependent dimensionless parameters. We consider flat case and find that\nviable cosmological evolution follows the sequence: an initial\nstiff-fluid-dominated phase, transitioning through a nearly dust-dominated era,\nand eventually reaching a stable dark energy-dominating state. Stability\nanalysis requires that $\\xi <0$ and $0 < c < 1$ for the theory to be physically\nvalid. Since zero NMC coupling, $\\xi=0$, is not allowed in the autonomous\nsystem, the model can not completely recover canonical scalar field case. That\nis to say, as $\\xi \\rightarrow 0^-$ and $c \\rightarrow 0^+$, the model can only\napproach the canonical scalar case but can not completely recover it. To\napproach dust or stiff fluid dominations, both magnitudes of the NMC coupling\nand the holographic parameter must be small. Numerical integration shows that\nfor any allowed values of $\\xi$ and $c$, $w_\\text{eff}$ approaches $-1$ at late\ntimes. Increasing of $c$ does not change shape of the $w_{\\rm eff}$, but larger\n$c$ increases $w_\\text{eff}$. As $\\xi$ becomes stronger, dust era gradually\ndisappears. Good behaviors of the dynamics require $-1 \\ll \\xi <0$ and $0 < c\n\\ll 1$."}
