IMPISH\nis a low-cost spectrometer designed to measure subsecond variation in hard\nX-ray time profiles from solar flares, with the goal of constraining particle\nacceleration timescales. To meet these requirements, we carried out a\nsystematic optimization of the scintillation design, focusing on maximizing\nphoton collection, reducing noise level, and improving energy resolution. We\ntested two high-yield scintillating crystals (LYSO, lutetium yttrium\noxyorthosilicate, and GAGG, gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet), two reflector\ntypes (specular and lambertian), two kinds of surface finishes (all sides\npolished and readout face only polished), different optical coupling materials\nand thicknesses, multiple geometries, and readout face angles. Our studies show\nthat light collection improves with increasing the crystal's effective area,\nbreaking its symmetry, and reducing the photon's travel length.

Unlike classic methods which generally estimate\nthe background using a simple linear interpolation of local galaxy flux in the\n2D spectrum, our approach leverages multi-band archival images of the host\ngalaxies to model the background emission from the galaxy in the 2D spectrum.\nSuch imaging is readily accessible through wide-field imaging surveys. These\nimages encode the wavelength-dependent galaxy profile along the slit. We\nconstruct a smooth prior for the 2D galaxy profile with a Gaussian process (GP)\nbased on these reference images, and use another GP to model the correlated\ndeviations from the prior in the observed spectrum. This enables accurate\ninference of the galaxy flux blended with the transient. On synthetic longslit\ndata of a spiral galaxy extracted from a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer\n(MUSE) hyper-spectral cube, the GP method remains robust as long as the host\ngalaxy is spatially resolved and consistently outperforms the classic method.\nWe apply the method to archival Keck spectra of two real transients, SN 2019eix\nand AT 2019qiz, to further demonstrate how the method uniquely recovers weak\nspectral features amid strong galaxy contamination, enabling refined\nconstraints on the properties of both transients.

We aim to demonstrate the improvement in\nrobustness of the ZWFS by reconstructing the wavefront based on\nmulti-wavelength measurements facilitated by technologies such as the microwave\nkinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs).

Firstly, we find\nthat using multiple wavelengths improves the dynamic range of the scalar ZWFS.\nHowever, for the vector ZWFS, its already extended range was not further\nincreased. In addition, a multi-wavelength reconstruction allowed us to take\nadvantage of a broader bandpass, which increases the number of available\nphotons, making the reconstruction more robust to photon noise. Finally,\nmulti-wavelength phase unwrapping enabled the measurement of large\ndiscontinuities such as petal errors with a trade-off in noise performance."}

However, proper use of\nthese materials requires us to understand and quantify the scintillation\nprocess. In this work, we propose a framework based on that of Birks [Proc.\nPhys. Soc. A 64, 874] and Meyer and Murray [Phys. Rev. 128, 98] to model the\nlight output of inorganic scintillators in response to beams of energetic heavy\nions over a broad range of energies. Our model suggests that, for sufficiently\nheavy ions at high energies, the majority of the light output is associated\nwith the creation of delta electrons, which are induced by the passage of the\nbeam through the material. These delta electrons dramatically impact the\nresponse of detection systems when subject to ions with velocities typical of\nbeams in modern fragmentation facilities. We test the accuracy of our model\nwith data from Lutetium Yttrium Orthosilicate (LYSO:Ce), a common inorganic\nscintillator. We compare calculated light production and quenching factors with\nexperimental data for heavy ions of varying mass and energy as well as make a\nquantitative estimate of the effects of delta rays on overall light output. The\nmodel presented herein will serve as a basic framework for further studies of\nscintillator response to heavy ions.

Völkel", "Tim Dietrich"], "title": "Black hole spectroscopy of collapsing and merging neutron stars", "comment": null, "summary": "Black hole spectroscopy is an important pillar when studying gravitational\nwaves from black holes and enables tests of general relativity. Most of the\ngravitational-wave signals observed over the last decade originate from binary\nblack hole systems. Binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star systems are\nrarer but of particular interest for the next-generation ground-based\ngravitational-wave detectors. These events offer the exciting possibility of\nstudying matter effects on the ringdown of \"dirty black holes\". In this work,\nwe ask the question: Does matter matter? Using numerical-relativity, we\nsimulate a wide range of collapsing neutron stars producing matter\nenvironments, both in isolated scenarios and in binary mergers. Qualitatively,\nthe resulting ringdown signals can be classified into \"clean\", \"modified\", and\n\"distorted\" cases, depending on the amount of matter that is present. We apply\nstandard strategies for extracting quasinormal modes of clean signals, using\nboth theory-agnostic and theory-specific assumptions. Even in the presence of\nmatter, possible modifications of quasinormal modes seem to be dominated by\nringdown modeling systematics. We find that incorporating multiple quasinormal\nmodes allows one to drastically reduce mismatches and errors in estimating the\nfinal black hole mass at early times. If not treated carefully, deviations in\nthe fundamental quasinormal mode might artificially be overestimated and\nfalsely attributed to the presence of matter or violations of general\nrelativity."}

To model the spacetime geometry, we resort the static Sen\nsolution -- originally derived in the framework of heterotic string theory --\nwhich reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime for vanishing electric charge. By\nfitting the observed frequencies within the relativistic precession model, we\nconstrain the mass and charge parameters of the Sen black hole and discuss\ntheir astrophysical implications, particularly in distinguishing classical\nblack holes from their string-inspired counterparts."}

Koshelev", "Yang Liu", "Anna Tokareva"], "title": "Energy conditions for regular black holes in EFT of gravity", "comment": "17 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good\ndescription of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature\nbelow the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower\nof higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective\nfield theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's\ngravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's\ngravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the\nquestion of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like\nblack holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution\nsupporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor\ncube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies\npositivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy\ncondition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular\nsolutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object,\ngiven that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off\nscale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the\nhorizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases."}
