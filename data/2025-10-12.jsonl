At the same time, the\nthermal challenges arising from its stacked architecture have drawn\nconsiderable attention. Most existing studies on HBM thermal management are\nbased on Fourier's law, neglecting the non-Fourier effects introduced by the\nmicro/nanoscale structures within HBM. In this study, the Monte Carlo method\n(MC) is employed to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and\ninvestigate the impact of non-Fourier heat transport on the thermal behavior of\nHBM structures. The results reveal that non-Fourier heat transport leads to a\njunction temperature that is 59.8 K higher than that predicted by Fourier's\nlaw. Furthermore, it is found that the phonon transmittance at the chip\ninterlayers has a severe impact on heat dissipation, with the temperature\nvariation reaching up to 56.6 K. These findings provide more accurate thermal\ninsights, which are critical for the optimized design of HBM systems."}

However, the development of optimal\ninterconnecting layers (ICLs) remains one major challenge for further\nefficiency gains, and progress in understanding the improved long-term\nstability of P-O tandem configuration has been lagging. In this study, we\nexperimentally investigate the enhanced stability of p-i-n P-O TSCs employing a\nsimplified C60/atomic-layer-deposition (ALD) SnOx/PEDOT: PSS ICL without an\nadditional charge recombination layer (CRL), which achieve an averaged\nefficiency of 25.12% and a hero efficiency of 25.5%. Our finding discovers that\nthe recrystallization of C60, a widely used electron transport layer in\nperovskite photovoltaics, leads to the formation of grain boundaries during\noperation, which act as migration channels for the interdiffusion of halide and\nAg ions. Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that the tandem device\narchitecture, incorporating organic semiconductor layers, effectively\nsuppresses the bi-directional ion diffusion and mitigates electrode corrosion.\nThus, the P-O TSC establishes a mutual protection system: the organic layers\nstabilize the perovskite sub-cell by suppressing ion diffusion-induced\ndegradation, and the perovskite layer shields the organic sub-cell from\nspectrally induced degradation. The simultaneous synergistic protection\nmechanism enables P-O TSCs to achieve exceptional long-term operational\nstability, retaining over 91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours of\ncontinuous metal-halide lamp illumination, and to exhibit minimal fatigue after\n86 cycles (2067 hours) of long-term diurnal (12/12-hour) testing. These results\ndemonstrate that tandem cells significantly outperform their single-junction\ncounterparts in both efficiency and stability."}

We find universal\nfeatures in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a\nzero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple\nscaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects),\nthe mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably\ntrapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal\nmode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially\ngrowing.

However, absorption spectra of galaxies prove rather\nchallenging at high redshift or in low mass galaxies, due to the need to spread\nthe photons into a relatively large set of spectral bins. For this reason, the\ndata from many state-of-the-art spectroscopic surveys suffer from low\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, and prevent accurate estimates of the stellar\npopulation parameters. In this paper, we tackle the issue of denoising an\nensemble by the use of unsupervised Deep Learning techniques trained on a\nhomogeneous sample of spectra over a wide range of S/N. These methods\nreconstruct spectra at a higher S/N and allow us to investigate the potential\nfor Deep Learning to faithfully reproduce spectra from incomplete data. Our\nmethodology is tested on three key line strengths and is compared with\nsynthetic data to assess retrieval biases. The results suggest a standard\nAutoencoder as a very powerful method that does not introduce systematics in\nthe reconstruction. We also note in this work how careful the analysis needs to\nbe, as other methods can -- on a quick check -- produce spectra that appear\nnoiseless but are in fact strongly biased towards a simple overfitting of the\nnoisy input. Denoising methods with minimal bias will maximise the quality of\nongoing and future spectral surveys such as DESI, WEAVE, or WAVES."}

This paper explores further the scale function source term to\nconstruct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of\nboth Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It\nis shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry\ncomprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of\nlength units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally\nfixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in\nwhich the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity\nis obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same\nprocedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke\ngravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from\ntheir Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the\nMach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is\ncontrolled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known\nscalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular\nLyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls\nthe unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from\nthe perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry\nmakes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the\nsame theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally.\nThe Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring\nscalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of\nthe energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein\nframe."}
