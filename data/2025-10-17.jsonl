This is typically\nimplemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network\ntraining alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well\nsuited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are\ncommonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing\nmodel fidelity.

A one-dimensional layered piezoelectric metamaterial\nintegrated with shunt circuits, consisting of a resistor, inductor, and\nstrain-proportional voltage feedback gain, is proposed to achieve dynamic\ncontrol of frequency-dependent stiffness and damping through electromechanical\ninteractions. Tuning the circuit parameters yields direction-dependent wave\nscattering at targeted frequencies. Dynamic homogenization reveals macroscopic\nconstitutive relations exhibiting both Willis and electro-momentum couplings.\nNon-Hermitian exceptional points are identified, where scattering eigenmodes\ncoalesce and produce extreme asymmetries in wave response. Near these points,\nthe system realizes unidirectional zero reflection (UZR) and unidirectional\nperfect absorption (UPA), achieving complete absorption from one direction and\ntotal reflection from the opposite side.

We then select representative black hole geometries to determine\nthe minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the\nassociated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our\nanalysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients\nsuffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we\nemphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be\nexploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics."}

J. Geom. Meth. Mod Phys", "summary": "We present an exact analytical study of Klein-Gordon (KG) scalar bosons and\nantibosons confined in the Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime under a uniform\nmagnetic field, incorporating rainbow gravity (RG) corrections with a positive\ncosmological constant. The cosmological constant partitions spacetime into an\ninfinite sequence of confinement domains bounded by impenetrable barriers.\nWithin the first allowed domain, the KG equation reduces to a hypergeometric\ndifferential equation, yielding closed-form expressions for both the energy\nspectra and the radial wavefunctions in terms of hypergeometric polynomials.\nTwo representative RG models, inspired by the Magueijo-Smolin framework and\nloop quantum gravity (LQG), produce Planck-scale bounded, symmetric\nparticle-antiparticle spectra. A distinctive feature of the curved magnetized\ngeometry is the collapse of all magnetic quantum states $m \\neq 0$ onto the $m\n= 0$ level for each radial excitation, a degeneracy absent in flat spacetime.\nIncreasing the cosmological constant partially lifts this collapse,\nestablishing a direct link between the global spacetime curvature and the local\nquantum structure. Radial probability density analysis further shows that\nstronger magnetic fields enhance spatial localization, confining bosons into\nstatic or rotating ring-like configurations with nodal architectures that\nevolve systematically with quantum numbers. These findings reveal how\ngravitational confinement, topology, magnetic fields, and Planck-scale\ncorrections jointly govern the spectral and spatial properties of relativistic\nquantum fields in curved and magnetized backgrounds."}

Two functional forms of the theory are\nconsidered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R,\nL_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \\lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are\nobtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density\nprofiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution\ninfluences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to\nverify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic\nmatter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total\ngravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical\nviability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and\nits implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational\nsignatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within\n$f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter\nenvironments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole\ngeometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new\ninsights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and\nastrophysical observations."}
