TL;DR: BGO材料在TOF-PET探测器中的应用受到晶体间散射(InterCS)事件的严重影响，导致时间分辨率下降和光子产额减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究像素化BGO阵列中晶体间散射事件对切伦科夫时间测量的影响，以改进TOF-PET系统的定时性能。

Method: 使用双像素探测器配合分段SiPM读出，通过能量加权定位对事件分类，并结合GATE模拟验证。

Result: InterCS事件的时间分辨率为221 ps FWHM，比FED事件的184 ps差；InterCS事件在首1 ns内平均检测到4.73个光子，少于FED事件的5.76个。

Conclusion: 在像素化BGO TOF-PET系统中需要采用时间感知的逐像素时间戳策略来应对散射影响，维持最佳定时性能。

Abstract: Bismuth germanate (BGO) is gaining renewed attention as a viable material for hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detectors. While single-crystal studies have demonstrated excellent timing resolution by leveraging prompt Cherenkov photons, practical detector modules based on pixelated arrays introduce a high prevalence of inter-crystal scattering (InterCS) events, complicating timing accuracy. In this study, we experimentally investigated the impact of InterCS on BGO Cherenkov timing using a dual-pixel detector coupled to a segmented SiPM readout. Events were classified into full-energy deposition (FED; primary crystal 511 keV absorption), InterCS, and penetration types via energy-weighted positioning and validated using GATE simulations, which also revealed that over 25% of the experimentally identified full-energy events involved intra-crystal scatter (IntraCS). For InterCS events, the optimal timestamp selection was achieved by choosing the earlier of the two timestamps, yielding a coincidence timing resolution of 221 ps FWHM (831 ps FWTM)-markedly worse than the 184 ps (603 ps FWTM) obtained for FED events. Furthermore, prompt photon yield was found to decrease measurably due to energy splitting: InterCS events averaged 4.73 detected photons in the first 1 ns, compared to 5.76 for FED events. These results emphasize the importance of incorporating time-aware, per-pixel timestamping strategies in pixelated BGO TOF-PET systems to maintain optimal timing performance in the presence of scatter.

Motivation: 将超导纳米线单光子探测器的性能扩展到中红外光谱区域，这对系外行星凌星光谱学和分子振动指纹识别等应用至关重要，但此前由于材料限制和可扩展性约束而面临挑战。

Method: 采用钨锗化物这一新型材料系统，结合了高红外灵敏度与大规模制造兼容性，开发了新型SNSPD探测器。

Conclusion: 这一进展使得以前无法访问的光谱区域实现了可扩展的高性能单光子检测，为遥感、热成像、环境监测、分子物理学和天文学开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are among the most sensitive single-photon detectors available and have the potential to transform fields ranging from infrared astrophysics to molecular spectroscopy. However, extending their performance into the mid-infrared spectral region - crucial for applications such as exoplanet transit spectroscopy and vibrational fingerprinting of molecules - has remained a major challenge, primarily due to material limitations and scalability constraints. Here, we report on the development of SNSPDs based on tungsten germanide, a novel material system that combines high infrared sensitivity with compatibility for large-scale fabrication. Our detectors exhibit saturated internal detection efficiency at wavelengths up to 29 $\mathrm{μm}$. This advance enables scalable, high-performance single-photon detection in a spectral region that was previously inaccessible, opening new frontiers in remote sensing, thermal imaging, environmental monitoring, molecular physics, and astronomy.

Method: 将Czochralski法生长的HPGe晶体纵向切成37段，通过霍尔效应测量提取硼、铝、镓、磷等杂质的浓度分布。

Result: 获得了高分辨率的杂质浓度分布图，确定了主要掺杂剂的有效分凝系数和初始熔体浓度，并与经典Burton-Prim-Slichter理论进行比较。

Conclusion: 研究结果为HPGe晶体拉制工艺优化提供了定量指导，改进了沿晶锭的杂质控制，支持下一代稀有事件搜索所需的大型低本底HPGe探测器的可靠制造。

Abstract: The performance and scalability of rare-event physics experiments depend on large-volume, detector-grade high-purity germanium (HPGe) crystals with precise control of impurity segregation during growth. We report a detailed study of impurity distribution in a single Czochralski-grown HPGe crystal produced at University of South Dakota (USD). The crystal was sectioned longitudinally into 37 segments, enabling the first high-resolution and systematic mapping of dopant profiles along the length of a detector-grade HPGe boule. Hall-effect measurements were used to extract impurity concentrations for boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), and phosphorus (P) in each segment. From these data, we determine effective segregation coefficients ($K_{eff}$) and initial melt concentrations ($C_0$) for the dominant dopants and compare them with classical Burton-Prim-Slichter expectations. The results provide quantitative insight into impurity transport and melt-solid partitioning under realistic detector growth conditions. These findings inform process-optimization strategies for HPGe crystal pulling, improve impurity control along the boule, and support the reliable fabrication of large, low-background HPGe detectors for next-generation rare-event searches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展MRI系统组装知识的获取途径，通过开源硬件和软件、简化安装要求以及协作培训计划来促进MRI技术的普及。

Method: 举办为期三天的工作坊，16名参与者协作构建MRI扫描仪，分为磁铁、被动匀场、射频线圈、梯度线圈、数据采集和重建等子系统团队，使用MaRCoS和PyPulseq库、CNC加工和3D打印技术。

Conclusion: 构建的扫描仪为教育计划、脉冲序列开发和临床前研究成像提供了有价值的平台，证明了开源MRI系统在培训和研发中的实用性。

Abstract: Access to Magnetic Resonance Imaging system assembly knowledge can be expanded by leveraging open-source hardware and software, simplified installation requirements, and collaborative training initiatives. To this end, we conducted a three-day workshop to construct an operational 0.27T MRI scanner. The workshop hosted 16 participants, including faculty, postdoctoral fellows, trainers, and students, who collaborated to build the scanner using open-source hardware and software components. Teams were designated to focus on various subsystems, including the magnet, passive shimming, radiofrequency (RF) coils, gradient coils, data acquisition, and reconstruction. Pre-workshop preparation involved simulation-based design processes and fabrication techniques, which incorporated configuring MaRCoS and PyPulseq libraries, CNC machining, and 3D printing. During the workshop, participants assembled an H-shaped magnet, which achieved a peak magnetic field strength of 0.269T. Passive shimming effectively reduced the field inhomogeneity from 3mT to 2mT. A 3 cm diameter RF solenoid was built and tuned to 11.4 MHz. The gradients exhibited less than 5% non-linearity in simulations and were fabricated by CNC machining copper plates. The assembled system was used to acquire a 2D spin echo of a water phantom. Following the workshop, the system was further optimized to scan relaxometry phantoms. A post-workshop survey was carried out, revealing over 87% satisfaction. The constructed scanner represents a valuable platform for educational initiatives, pulse sequence development, and preclinical research imaging efforts.

### [5] [Causal Rigidity and the Single-Unit Universe: Integrating the Alexandrov-Zeeman and Unruh Clock Scales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20728)
*Karl Svozil*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 该论文统一了两种关于相对论时空和基本常数计数的互补观点，证明只需要一个基本维度常数就能确定时空几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一MPSV的操作性观点和Alexandrov-Zeeman定理的数学观点，澄清相对论时空中基本常数的数量问题。

Method: 通过形式化推导证明单个时钟世界线的归一化足以从共形类中选择唯一度量，打破膨胀对称性。

Result: 证明了单个基本常数足以确定时空几何，澄清了基本常数的数量正好是一个。

Conclusion: Alexandrov-Zeeman定理建立了时空的刚性共形结构，而MPSV的"真实时钟"打破了膨胀对称性，两者相互补充地证明了只需要一个基本维度常数。

Abstract: We unify two complementary viewpoints on relativistic spacetime and the counting of fundamental constants. Operationally, Matsas, Pleitez, Saa, and Vanzella (MPSV) have recently argued that relativistic spacetime requires only a single fundamental dimensional constant. Mathematically, theorems due to Alexandrov and Zeeman demonstrate that the light-cone structure determines the spacetime geometry only up to a conformal factor. We show that these approaches are mutually reinforcing: the Alexandrov-Zeeman theorems establish the rigid conformal structure of spacetime, while the ``bona fide clock'' required by MPSV serves the necessary mathematical role of breaking the dilation symmetry. We provide a formal derivation proving that the normalization of a single clock worldline is sufficient to select a unique metric from the conformal class, thereby clarifying that the number of fundamental constants is exactly one.

### [6] [Denoising gravitational wave with deep learning in the time-frequency domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20731)
*Yi-De Lee,Hwei-Jang Yo*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Griffin-Lim算法的深度学习模型，用于从引力波数据中降噪，特别关注相位恢复，在模拟和真实事件中都表现出良好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引力波降噪是揭示宇宙中致密双星天体事件的重要任务。传统匹配滤波方法存在局限，深度学习提供了更高效的解决方案，但目前多数研究仅使用时域数据，时频数据处理具有独特优势。

Method: 针对总质量大于30太阳质量的双黑洞合并事件，提出结合Griffin-Lim算法的深度学习模型，利用先验降噪的幅度谱图来特别关注相位恢复。

Result: 降噪结果在模拟注入波形的幅度和相位对齐方面拟合良好，应用于真实检测事件时与模拟模板波形高度一致，尤其在合并阶段具有高精度。

Conclusion: 这项工作为引力波数据分析提供了更好的方法设计可能性，展示了深度学习与时频分析结合在引力波信号处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Gravitational wave denoising is an ongoing task for revealing the events of compact binary objects in the universe. Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage. Our work suggests the possibility of a better methodological design for gravitational wave data analysis.

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于相干态的引力动力学哈密顿形式，用于描述准经典几何的时间演化，并应用于黑洞蒸发问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多种量子引力理论中，准经典几何由相干态描述，需要建立相应的动力学框架来研究几何之间的隧穿和黑洞蒸发中的幺正性问题。

Method: 提出了基于相干态基的引力动力学哈密顿形式，考虑相干态的非正交性，研究初始准经典几何如何演化到不同振幅的叠加态。

Result: 该框架为几何之间的隧穿提供了动力学机制，并暗示了在黑洞蒸发过程中通过量子修正可能保持幺正性。

Conclusion: 该相干态框架为量子引力中的几何隧穿现象提供了统一描述，并为解决黑洞信息悖论提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.

### [8] [Wormholes as perturbations of near-horizon black hole geometries: no-go theorems within effective field theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21017)
*Takamasa Kanai,Kengo Maeda,Daisuke Yoshida*

Main category: gr-qc

TL;DR: 本文证明了在有效场论方法中，无法通过微扰构造从Reissner-Nordström或Myers-Perry黑洞产生可穿越虫洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过微扰方法从已知黑洞解构造可穿越虫洞，特别是在有效场论框架下考虑高阶导数修正的情况。

Method: 将虫洞构造重新表述为在近极端黑洞近视界几何附近的微扰，分析有效能动量张量在喉部附近的约束条件。

Result: 发现近视界区域的增强对称性严重限制了喉部附近的有效能动量张量，阻止了可穿越喉部结构的形成。

Conclusion: 在有效场论方法中，无法微扰地从Reissner-Nordström或Myers-Perry黑洞产生可穿越虫洞，需要新成分（如Casimir能量）或对称性较低的黑洞。

Abstract: We reformulate the construction of wormhole solutions as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes in four dimensions and equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry black holes in five dimensions. When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordström or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.

### [9] [Observational appearance and photon rings of non-singular black holes from anisotropic fluids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21183)

TL;DR: 本文研究了Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld引力与各向异性流体耦合的非奇点球对称黑洞的光学外观，发现此类黑洞与史瓦西黑洞在光子环特征上难以区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非奇点黑洞与史瓦西黑洞在观测特征上的差异，特别是通过光子环结构来区分不同类型的黑洞。

Method: 使用几何薄且光学薄的吸积盘模型，采用标准无束缚轮廓的单色发射，生成黑洞图像并分析光子环宽度，重建近束缚测地线的李雅普诺夫指数。

Result: 这类非奇点黑洞与史瓦西黑洞在光子环特征上难以区分，理论、数值、盘模型和观测不确定性相互纠缠，无法清晰区分李雅普诺夫指数。

Conclusion: 仅通过光子环方法难以区分这类非奇点黑洞与史瓦西黑洞，需要结合动力学设置如热点或引力波准正规模来克服这一困难。

Abstract: We consider the optical appearance of a non-singular, spherically symmetric black hole from Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity coupled to anisotropic fluids. Such a black hole has a single (external) horizon located very near the Schwarzschild radius, $r_h=2M$, while its surface of unstable bound geodesics (photon sphere) is located at a moderately shortened radius than its Schwarzschild counterpart. Relying on a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk with a monochromatic emission described by suitable adaptations of Standard Unbound profiles previously employed in the literature, we generate images of this solution, which displays relevant modifications to the typical photon ring and central brightness depression features found in black hole images. In this sense, we fit the width of the two first photon rings in order to reconstruct the Lyapunov exponent of nearly-bound geodesics characterizing the theoretical ratio of successive rings. Such an exponent is tightly attached to observational features of photon rings such as their relative intensities in time-averaged images and the time-scale of hot-spots. Our results point out that non-singular black holes of this type are hard to distinguish from their Schwarzschild counterparts using this method alone, since the theoretical, numerical, disk-modeling, and observational uncertainties are too entangled with one another to allowing a neat distinction of such an exponent. It also points out to the need of incorporating dynamical settings such as hot-spots or quasi-normal modes from gravitational wave ringdowns as a way to circumvent such difficulties.

Motivation: 研究黑洞在复合环境（修正Chaplygin类暗流体和弦云）中的可观测特征，为探测奇异黑洞环境提供具体预测。

Method: 使用WKB近似计算准正规模频率和灰体谱，分析关键光子轨道和球对称吸积下的光学表现，研究它们在eikonal极限下的对应关系。

Result: 弦云强度对阴影、准正规模态和灰体因子有主要影响，而MCDF参数引入更复杂但可表征的修正。环境组分在关键可观测量上留下独特但相互关联的特征。

Conclusion: 复合环境组分在黑洞关键观测特征上留下可区分的印记，为探测奇异黑洞环境提供了具体的方法和预测。

Abstract: We present a unified investigation of black hole shadows, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and greybody factors (GBFs) for a static, spherically symmetric black hole within a composite environment of a modified Chaplygin-like dark fluid (MCDF) and a cloud of strings (CoS). We examine the structure of critical photon orbits and the corresponding optical appearance under spherical accretion. Using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, we compute the quasinormal frequencies and greybody spectra, and explore their correspondence with the black hole shadows in the eikonal limit. A systematic parameter study demonstrates that the CoS intensity has the primary influence on the shadows, QNMs and GBFs, while the MCDF parameters introduce more complex but characterizable modifications to each. Our results demonstrate that these environmental components imprint distinct yet interrelated signatures on key observables, offering specific predictions for probing exotic black hole environments.

TL;DR: 本文研究了带电质量标量波在克尔-纽曼黑洞赤道面上的散射，首次系统分析了黑洞电荷、电磁相互作用和场质量对散射截面的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带电旋转黑洞赤道面上标量波散射的独特特征，区别于先前研究的轴向散射情况，探索黑洞电荷、电磁相互作用和场质量对散射模式的影响。

Method: 使用分波法计算微分散射截面，通过级数约化技术处理前向发散问题，系统研究黑洞电荷、电磁相互作用和场质量对赤道面散射截面的影响。

Result: 发现无论是否存在电磁相互作用，参考系拖曳效应都会使荣耀散射偏离精确后向方向；洛伦兹吸引力或场质量增加会显著增强中大角度散射通量强度；超辐射发生时，顺行散射角截面随黑洞自旋增加而增加。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了带电旋转时空在赤道面上的独特散射特征，这些特征与先前的轴向分析明显不同，为识别带电旋转黑洞提供了新的观测特征。

Abstract: The scattering of charged massive scalar waves by Kerr-Newman black holes, with incidence along the equatorial plane, is investigated in this work. The differential scattering cross section is computed using the partial wave method, with the forward divergence handled via the series reduction technique. For the first time, we systematically examine the influence of the black hole charge, electromagnetic interactions, and field mass on the equatorial cross section. Our results reveal that regardless of whether the electromagnetic interaction is present or not, the frame-dragging effect shifts the glory away from the exact backward direction and can place interference minima there, contrasting with the on-axis scattering case. The average scattered flux intensity at the medium to large scattering angles exhibits a large enhancement as the Lorentz attraction or field mass increases, particularly in the slowly rotating regime, with the enhancement being frequency-dependent. When superradiance occurs, we observe that the cross section in the prograde scattering angles ($\sim 135^{\circ} < φ< 270^{\circ}$) increases as the black hole spin increases, due to enhanced prograde partial wave contributions. Meanwhile, the superradiant scattering cross section increases in all (except the forward) directions when the Lorentz force becomes more repulsive. These findings highlight unique equatorial-plane signatures of charged, rotating spacetimes, distinguishing them from prior on-axis analyses.

Conclusion: 该方法为验证引力介质是否必须是非经典提供了新途径，可能启发其他光子纠缠实验

Abstract: In order to detect the quantum nature of gravity, the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses(QGEM) has been proposed both in flat and curved spacetime. In this paper we propose an analogous QGEM protocol using photons produced in astronomical processes as the quantum systems. Unlike massive particles, the gravitational interaction between photons-intrinsically relativistic particles-simultaneously satisfies both the event and system localities. So it can provide a clear test of whether the gravitational mediator must be nonclassical based on the Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) principle. Although the gravitationally induced entanglement between massless relativistic photons is extremely small, our quantitative calculations clarify the characteristic features of the entanglement induced by the photon's own gravitational field in astronomical process and may inspire other photon entanglement experiments.

Conclusion: AVV的研究在带电无质量标量场塌缩的晚期动力学分析中存在严重缺陷，其与HP结果的差异源于分析错误而非物理现象。

Abstract: The asymptotically decaying tails that characterize the late-time dynamics of collapsing self-gravitating charged massless scalar fields were studied three decades ago by Hod and Piran (HP). In particular, it was shown, both analytically and numerically, that the late-time behavior of these collapsing charged massless scalar fields is governed by oscillatory inverse power law tails, which decay more slowly than the familiar tails of neutral massless fields. Recently Álvares and Vaño-Viñuales (AVV) have investigated the same model numerically. While most of their results are in very good agreement with the earlier findings of HP, there are also some discrepancies between the original results of HP and those reported by AVV. In this compact comment, we wish to highlight a number of inaccurate claims and critical errors in the analysis and results presented by AVV.

Motivation: 研究正则化AdS黑洞的热力学性质，特别是Simpson-Visser正则化参数对热力学定律和相变行为的影响。

Method: 应用Simpson-Visser正则化方案到AdS黑洞，分析热力学第一定律、推导熵公式、进行自由能分析和相结构研究，并考察黑洞合并场景。

Conclusion: Simpson-Visser正则化显著影响AdS黑洞的热力学性质，包括相变行为和合并后的质量约束，这些效应在正则化参数消失时回归标准黑洞结果。

Abstract: In this article, we performed Simpson-Visser (SV)-regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and then studied thermal properties of the resulting spacetime geometry. We considered the validity of the first law of black hole thermodynamics in this case and derived an entropy formula consistent with this new regular geometry. Next, we carried out the free energy analysis and studied the phase structure of these black holes. We discovered non-trivial phase transition properties dependent on the SV-regularization parameter. We also considered the validity of the second law of black hole thermodynamics and analyzed a merger scenario of two equal mass SV-regular black holes. In particular, we investigated the impact of the SV-regularization parameter on the constraints on post-merger black hole mass. Intrestingly, we found that the bounds initially increase and then fall sharply with increasing the SV-regularization parameter. All results are compared with standard black holes for vanishing SV-regularization parameter.

Abstract: The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.

Conclusion: 轻场和强相互作用增强修正效应，曲率抑制修正，共形耦合场无领头阶贡献，为量子场相互作用修正黑洞熵提供了清晰的解析证明

Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.

Abstract: Recently, a remarkable new class of spacetimes describing black holes immersed in a non-aligned electromagnetic field has been found. While still of type D, this class goes beyond the famous Plebański--Demiański family. Here we demonstrate that the whole class admits a hidden symmetry encoded in the non-degenerate conformal Killing--Yano 2-form. Interestingly, as a direct consequence of non-alignment of the electromagnetic field and contrary to the Plebański--Demiański class (where the field is aligned), such a symmetry no longer generates the full "tower of symmetries". Despite this, it enables one to separate variables in massless Hamilton--Jacobi, conformal wave, and massless Dirac equations, as well as allows one to tackle massless vector and tensor perturbations. These results provide a useful mathematical tool for discussing numerous (astrophysical) applications to be described by these metrics. Moreover, as we shall show, the novel spacetimes provide an interesting test-ground for studying the recently defined Penrose charges whose existence is intrinsically related to hidden rather than explicit symmetries.

Abstract: We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments. The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant.

Result: CE探测器在最大合并率（250 Gpc-3yr-1）下获得最佳质量精度，约为8%太阳质量。

Conclusion: 未来地面引力波观测站需要提高高频灵敏度，以获得更精确的MTOV估计，特别是需要改进能确定合并是否形成黑洞的频率范围的灵敏度。

Abstract: The detection of the gravitational waves produced after the coalescence of two neutron stars is greatly anticipated because it will be able to provide information about matter in extreme conditions, especially if the remnant turns out to go through a hypermassive or a supermassive neutron star state before collapsing into a black hole. Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as ET, CE, and NEMO are expected to observe high-frequency gravitational wave signals, that is, the post-merger stage of the coalescence of binary neutron stars; then from these signals one can estimate the maximum mass that a spinless neutron star (MTOV) can have. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the determination of the MTOV precision from the post-merger detected by next-generation observatories. The results show that CE achieves the best mass precision with approximately 8% $M_{\odot}$ for the maximum merger rate (250 Gpc-3yr-1). Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, it will still be necessary to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies of future ground-based gravitational wave observatories if one wants to obtain greater precision in the MTOV estimation. One possibility would be to improve the sensitivity in a frequency range that allows us to determine whether or not a black hole was formed in the coalescence.

Conclusion: 弦云参数显著影响黑洞周围的时空结构和潮汐力分布，即使在远距离也会改变开普勒频率和潮汐力剖面。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate relativistic tidal forces around a black hole sourced by a cloud of strings, described by the generalized Letelier-Alencar solution. We first review the original Letelier spacetime and its recent generalization, computing the Kretschmann scalar, and showing that the generalized model exhibits a stronger curvature divergence at $r \to 0$ than both Letelier and Schwarzschild cases. We then analyze geodesic motion in this background. For massless particles, we focus on circular photon orbits, while for massive particles, we consider both radial infall and circular motion. We find that the radii of the photon sphere and of the innermost stable circular orbit increase with the cloud of strings parameter $g_s$ and decrease with the length scale $l_s$, and that circular orbits cease to exist in certain regions of the parameter space. For radial motion, we compute the radial acceleration and the corresponding tidal forces. In this case, we show that an inversion between stretching and compression may occur, although this regime is typically hidden inside the event horizon. Finally, we study tidal forces for observers in circular motion, showing that the cloud of strings modifies the Keplerian frequency and the tidal force profile even at large distances, and that in this case there is no sign change of the tidal components.

Abstract: I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.

Abstract: We introduce a novel direct calibration algorithm to address phase delay, gain, and offset mismatches in Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) time interleaving systems. These mismatches, common in high-speed data acquisition, degrade system performance and signal integrity, particularly in applications such as radio astronomy and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Our proposed algorithm uses a sinusoidal reference signal and Fourier analysis to isolate and correct each type of mismatch, providing a computationally efficient solution. Extensive numerical simulations validate the algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its ability to significantly enhance signal reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods. This work provides a robust and scalable solution for maintaining signal fidelity in interleaved ADC systems and has broad applications in fields that require high-speed data acquisition.

Abstract: Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.

Abstract: Building on our previous work, we apply a U-Net Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework to denoise galaxy images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and enhance morphological classification. This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe. The results highlight the potential of VAE-based denoising as a robust pre-processing step for analyzing high-redshift galaxy populations in ongoing astronomical surveys.

Motivation: 理解高纯锗在从体材料减薄到微米尺度时载流子迁移率的变化规律，对优化辐射探测器、薄体锗电子器件和量子器件至关重要。

Method: 在室温下对从2.7mm减薄到7μm的n型和p型高纯锗样品进行霍尔效应测量，分析迁移率的厚度依赖性。

Result: 迁移率遵循扩展指数依赖关系μ(t)=μ₀[1-exp(-(t/τ)ᵝ)]，特征静电长度τ=6-50μm。迁移率下降主要由静电耗尽效应而非表面散射控制。

Conclusion: 提出了器件设计规则：保持厚度t≳3τ可保留大部分体迁移率，更薄的器件进入耗尽控制区域。提取的参数为超薄高纯锗迁移率工程提供了定量基准。

Abstract: Understanding how charge-carrier mobility evolves as high-purity germanium (HPGe) is thinned from bulk to micrometer scale is essential for optimizing advanced radiation detectors, thin-body Ge electronics, and emerging quantum devices. We report, to our knowledge, the first systematic thickness-dependent mobility study on bulk-grown, detector-grade HPGe, performing Hall-effect measurements on $n$- and $p$-type samples thinned from $2.7~\mathrm{mm}$ down to $7~\mathrm{μm}$ at room temperature. The mobility follows an extended-exponential dependence $μ(t) = μ_0 \left[ 1 - \exp\big( - (t/τ)^β \big) \right]$ with characteristic electrostatic lengths $τ= 6$--$50~\mathrm{μm}$. Comparison with boundary-scattering and depletion-based models shows that mobility degradation is dominated not by Fuchs--Sondheimer surface scattering but by electrostatic depletion that reduces the effective conducting channel thickness. Across all samples, the hierarchy $λ_D < τ\lesssim W_0$ identifies long-range screening and near-surface electric fields as the primary mechanisms governing the mobility crossover. This connection provides a simple device-level design rule: maintaining $t \gtrsim 3τ$ preserves most of the bulk mobility, while thinner devices enter a depletion-controlled regime with sharply reduced transport. The extracted parameters thus supply quantitative benchmarks for mobility engineering in ultrathin HPGe and a predictive framework for Ge-on-insulator structures, fully depleted channels, and future Ge-based quantum and electronic technologies.

Conclusion: 这项研究展示了一种实用的室温太赫兹频率梳解决方案，为太赫兹技术在高速无线通信等领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) frequency combs (TFCs) are promising for numerous applications in spectroscopy, metrology, sensing, and wireless communications. However, the practical applications of TFCs have been hindered thus far by the need for cryogenic cooling, limited bandwidth, and bulky configuration, largely due to the lack of advanced THz sources. Here, we report an electrically pumped, room-temperature, broadband, compact, and tunable TFC by integrating an actively mode-locked resonant tunneling diode (RTD) in a metallic waveguide. By injecting a strong, continuous-wave radio frequency (RF) signal into a direct-current-driven RTD oscillator, we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, offset-free comb spectrum spanning more than one octave, from 0.14 to 0.325 THz at room temperature. Moreover, we show that the repetition frequency of the TFC can be tuned from 0.9 to 50 GHz by the injected RF signal, and a 120 Gbps (16 Gbps per channel) data rate can be achieved in the TFC-based high-speed single-channel (multi-channel) wireless communications.

Motivation: 传统方法生成和操纵拓扑激发依赖于外部规范场和结构化光调制或微腔TE-TM偏振分裂，前者只能间接访问极化激子赝自旋，后者缺乏对拓扑缺陷的确定性控制。

Method: 使用具有破缺反演对称性的单块BIC钙钛矿超表面，通过自旋动量锁定在极化激子凝聚时产生半涡旋对，并研究极化激子密度增加对涡旋间距的影响。

Result: 在极化激子凝聚时产生了由连接相反自旋的偏振弦连接的半涡旋对，极化激子密度增加导致特征蓝移增强，进而使涡旋间距减小，揭示了与腔拓扑相关的确定性相互作用。

Conclusion: 通过仅利用结构控制，该方法能够稳健地工程化极化激子流体的固有赝自旋纹理，为操纵涡旋成核、相互作用和湮灭提供了多功能平台，无需使用外部场。

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in exciton-polariton condensates governs spinor interactions among quasi-particles and shapes the emergence of topological excitations, such as vortices, solitons, and strings. Conventional approaches to generate and manipulate these excitations rely on external gauge fields and structured light modulation, or microcavity TE-TM polarization splitting. While the former can only access the polariton pseudospin indirectly, through separate coupling of the excitonic or photonic component, the latter suffers from a lack of deterministic control over the resulting topological defects. Here, we report the generation of topology-induced spin polaritons in a monolithic bound state in the continuum (BIC) perovskite metasurface with broken inversion symmetry. Upon condensation, spin-momentum locking enables the generation of a pair of half-vortex within the polariton fluid, which display mutual attraction due to the connecting polarization string linking their opposite spins. We find that an increase in polariton density, enhancing the characteristic blueshift of the emission spectrum, leads to a narrowing of the inter-vortex separation, revealing deterministic interactions pinned to the cavity topology. By harnessing structural control alone, our approach enables robust engineering of the intrinsic pseudospin texture of the polariton fluid, offering a versatile platform for manipulating vortex nucleation, interaction, and annihilation without employing external fields.

Abstract: This paper introduces fly-by transit (FBT), a novel mobility system that employs modular mini-electric vehicles (mini-EVs) to provide door-to-door shared mobility with minimal stops. Unlike existing modular minibus concepts that rely on in-motion coupling and passenger transfers -- technologies unlikely to mature soon -- FBT lowers the technological barriers by building upon near-term feasible solutions. The system comprises two complementary mini-EV modules: low-cost trailers for on-demand feeder trips and high-performance leaders that guide coupled trailers in high-speed platoons along trunk lines. Trailers operate independently for detour-free feeder services, while stationary coupling at designated hubs enables platoons to achieve economies of scale (EoS). In-motion decoupling of the tail trailer allows stop-less operation without delaying the main convoy.
  As a proof of concept, a stylized corridor model is developed to analyze optimal FBT design. Results indicate that FBT can substantially reduce travel times relative to conventional buses and lower operating costs compared with e-hailing taxis. Numerical analyses further demonstrate that FBT achieves stronger EoS than both buses and taxis, yielding more than 13\% savings in generalized system costs. By addressing key limitations of existing transit systems, this study establishes FBT as a practical and scalable pathway toward transformative urban mobility and outlines directions for future research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了表面声波驱动的粒子振动输运现象，分析了可变形粒子与刚性基底的接触力学，发现粒子可以沿波传播方向或反向漂移，包括滑动和弹跳两种运动模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统振动输运理论将粒子视为刚性基底的质点，需要更真实的接触模型来准确描述可变形粒子在表面声波作用下的运动行为。

Method: 使用基于Cattaneo-Mindlin力学的接触模型和记忆图方法计算迟滞摩擦力，数值求解运动方程，分析粒子在永久接触和多次弹跳两种状态下的运动特性。

Result: 发现可变形粒子在永久接触状态下可通过不对称滑动产生漂移，在多次弹跳状态下可通过与波周期同步实现定向运动；而质点模型在相同条件下不会产生漂移或呈现混沌弹跳。

Conclusion: 粒子的可变形性对振动输运行为至关重要，可变形粒子的接触力学特性使其能够实现定向漂移，这与实验观察一致，而传统质点模型无法准确预测这种现象。

Abstract: A particle on a substrate supporting a surface acoustic wave can experience horizontal drift excited by the dry friction force. The effect is referred to as vibrational transportation, or as a surface acoustic wave motor. A traditional theory of vibrational transportation considers a particle as a material point moving on a rigid substrate. A more realistic representation is a contact model based on Cattaneo-Mindlin (also called Hertz-Mindlin) mechanics applicable to an axisymmetric deformable particle. A recent semi-analytical extension of the Cattaneo-Mindlin solution called the Method of Memory Diagrams allows one to compute the hysteretic friction force for an arbitrary loading history in terms of contact displacements, and, subsequently, to numerically solve the equations of motion. Depending on the materials' and excitation parameters, the particle can stay in permanent contact with the substrate or experience multiple jumps. In the former case, the particle can slide along the surface, during each wave period, advancing and receding with different efficiencies, which finally results in a drift. The drift can occur both in the wave propagation direction and against it. In the regime of multiple jumps, directed horizontal motion is also possible. It is based on synchronization between the wave period and rebounding events. A rebound occurs once per period and consistently at the same phase. At the beginning of the process, the particle moves with an acceleration that decreases and finally disappears. Exactly the same type of motion against the wave has been observed in our preliminary experiments. We demonstrate that a point mass behaves differently: in a regime of permanent contact, negative and positive sliding are equilibrated, which produces no drift, whereas multiple rebounds of a point mass are always chaotic, at least for fully conservative collisions.

Abstract: The paper considers a model for the solar cell as a mechanical open-cycle thermodynamic engine where the chemical potential is produced in an isochoric process corresponding to the thermalization of electron-hole pairs. Expansion of the beam under one-sun illumination and current generation are described as isothermal lost work. More generally, voltage produced in an open cycle process corresponds to availability, leading to a correction to the Shockley-Queisser detailed balance limit.
