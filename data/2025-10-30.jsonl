The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales.

We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise.

It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial\nlow-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The\nobservation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from\nextragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the\ndetector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background\nsimulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work\nwe perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in\norbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to\ndetermine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We\ndetermine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed\nas Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic\nbackground photons dominate at low energies (<660 keV), while delayed\nactivation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate\nat higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (<1 deg)\nbetween recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector\n(HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the\nAP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor\n9 by the model.

Our numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we\ndemonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits local DSS behavior,\ncharacterized by an echoing period of~$\\Delta \\simeq 0.7388$, agreeing with\nprevious works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities\nsuch as the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We\nfurthermore show that the mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold\nevolutions scales as a function of the distance to the critical parameter, with\na critical exponent of approximately~$\\gamma=0.1977\\pm0.0009$. Finally, our\nfindings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial\ndata."}

In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured\nquasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes\nof point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although\nthese definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ\nby finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working\nentirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each\ncompanion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory\n-- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that\npreserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the\napparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute\nits quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the\nleading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle)\nparameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating\nharmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle\nmass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon\npenetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the\nPN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for\nhybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in\nNR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework\nprovides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be\nextended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges."}
