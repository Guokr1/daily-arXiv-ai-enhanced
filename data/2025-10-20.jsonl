Our loading schemes result in macroscopic\nstiffness varying by a factor of two with loading direction, chosen by a\nreversible actuation independent of the load itself. Second, we study the\neffect of the pneumatic actuation on acoustic properties of the microstructure,\nfinding the proposed method viable to trigger different acoustic bandgaps."}

Submitted to The European Physical Journal C", "summary": "Tidal forces acting on orbiting bodies arise from inhomogeneities in the\ngravitational field, generating stresses that can deform or even disrupt these\nobjects. In this work, we analyze relativistic tidal forces associated with\nultracompact objects described by static and spherically symmetric spacetimes,\nfocusing on observers in circular geodesic motion. We show that, in contrast to\nthe case of radial geodesics, tidal forces diverge as the orbit approaches null\ncircular geodesics. As illustrative examples, we study two uniform-density\nstellar models: one isotropic and another supported purely by tangential\nstresses. We conjecture that the divergence of tidal forces near light rings\nmay play a role in the nonlinear stability of ultracompact, horizonless\nobjects."}

A key property when evaluating time-domain models is\nwhen to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit\nlow-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems\nwith total mass $\\ge 200 \\, M_{\\odot}$, we show that current detectors are\nsensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained.\nWe show that for systems with total mass $\\lesssim 300 \\, M_{\\odot}$, mass\nratio $\\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\\rho \\gtrsim 20$, templates\nstarting at $20 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total\nmass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates\nstarting from $13 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the\ngravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\\rho < 20$,\ntime-domain models can start from $20\\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical\nuncertainties dominate."}

The fundamental field, which contains information about all physical\nfields in spacetime and defines the phase space geometry, is a scalar field in\nphase space that is interpreted as a point-particle Hamiltonian. We construct\nan action principle for scalar fields in phase space and derive the\ncorresponding scalar field equation. By choosing a specific scalar field,\nnamely the Hamiltonian describing a charged particle in curved spacetime with\nan electromagnetic field, we show that this phase-space scalar field equation\nis equivalent to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations in spacetime, thus\nproviding a geometric unification of gravity and electromagnetism. We further\ndiscuss how this approach differs from previous unification attempts and its\npotential for describing further physical fields and their dynamics in a\nunified manner in terms of phase-space geometry."}
