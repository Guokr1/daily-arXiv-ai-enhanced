The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments\nrely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors,\nwhich present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic\nradioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&D\nproject developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is\nread out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon\ndetection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark\nnoise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at\ncryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed\ncryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the\ndetector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K.

While this\napproach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of\nnanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any\ndirectional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the\ngravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the\ngravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple\nquadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction\non the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this\nway, we describe the full, $S_2 \\times S_2$, state-space of a polarized\ngravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\\'e sphere\ndescribing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what\nis the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent\npixels can a such a map contain?

It turns out the\nanswer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\\rm res} = 16 \\times 2 = 32$, where\n16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct\npolarization states.

A high spectral resolving power of 90 000 and 75 000 is\nprovided in HA and HE modes, respectively. The overall throughput from the top\nof the atmosphere to the detector peaks at 13 percent.

While this\napproach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of\nnanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any\ndirectional information.

In this\nway, we describe the full, $S_2 \\times S_2$, state-space of a polarized\ngravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincar\\'e sphere\ndescribing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what\nis the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent\npixels can a such a map contain?
