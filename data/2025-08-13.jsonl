In the second part, I summarise a recent\nwork in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds\nsurrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to\nsuperradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like\nentangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left,\nright) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr\ngeometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type\nanomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions.\nDepending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous\nterms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS\nterms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled\nsqueezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\\omega$-effect."}

When\nthe black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions\namong different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact\non the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted\ngravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were\nproposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate\nthe effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on\nthe gravitational wave emission.

However, this\nGaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and\ncosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB)\ngenerated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this\nwork, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features\nin PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or\nsignal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this\napproach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully\nanalytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This\nmakes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis\ntools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by\nproducing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred\nfrom the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We\nvalidate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to\nnon-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function\nof the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically\nmotivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB\nand show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual\nsource.

Keeble", "Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño"], "title": "Estimating High-Order Time Derivatives of Kerr Orbital Functionals", "comment": "11 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many\ncalculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave\ngeneration to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these\nfunctions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental\nfrequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the\ncoupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two\nstrategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate\nhigh-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first\nmethod maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second\nmethod fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated\ncoordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to\noverfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the\nmapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital\nfunctional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation,\nwe propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate\nwith respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass\nquadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth\nderivative with a fractional residual $\\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics.\nFor orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed\nin Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for\ncomputing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These\nresults offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time\nderivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to\napplications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling,\nwhere such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave\npredictions."}

A detailed study of the evolution\nequations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll\napproximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It\nis found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by\ndemanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of\nscalar perturbations and a positive running index $\\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It\nis not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by\nmodifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a\npositive running $\\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them.

However, this\nGaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and\ncosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB)\ngenerated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this\nwork, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features\nin PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or\nsignal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this\napproach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully\nanalytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This\nmakes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis\ntools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by\nproducing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred\nfrom the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We\nvalidate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to\nnon-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function\nof the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically\nmotivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB\nand show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual\nsource.
