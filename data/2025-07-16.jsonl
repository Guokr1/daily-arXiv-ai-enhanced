Most existing F-W BICs are realized in open systems through the\ninterference between waveguides and resonant cavities. However, with increasing\ndemands for higher resolution and sensitivity in modern chemical and biological\nsensing, the practically measured Q-factors of conventional open-system F-W\nBICs often fall short of expectations.In this work, we introduce F-P resonance\nvia acoustic-solid coupling to explore the formation mechanism and realization\nmethod of high-Q F-W BICs in quasi-closed systems, and further investigate\ntheir application in gas sensing. A coupled resonator model combining elastic\nand acoustic waves in a quasi-closed cavity is first established. Coupled mode\ntheory is employed to calculate the eigenmodes of both localized and radiative\nmodes. Based on this, the Hamiltonian matrix of the coupled system is\nconstructed, from which the acoustic transmission spectrum is derived. The\nresults show that the Q-factor of the F-W BIC induced by acoustic-solid\ncoupling is significantly higher than that of open systems, which is further\nvalidated by experiments.Based on this, a gas concentration sensing technique\nbased on acoustic-solid coupled F-W BIC behavior is developed.

Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated the possibility to significantly accelerate the development of\nelectromagnetic showers inside scintillating crystals typically used in\nhomogeneous calorimeters based on scintillating crystals when the incident beam\nis aligned with a crystallographic axis to within a few mrad. In particular, a\nreduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic\nelectron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along\none of its main axes.

However, because of the high level of\nmeasurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for\nimprovement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a\nsingle aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time.\nBayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to\nreconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field\nis a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for\nthis by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in\nthe continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach\nto reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on\nthe best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses\nparametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess\ncontribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband\nRFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector\ndescription, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the\nshower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum.

Whereas in\nHartle-Hawking vacuum both the observers see finite energy-density and flux at\nthe horizon, irrespective of the value of field temperature. Particularly in\nthe case of Schwarzschild spacetime, a freely falling observer finds its\ninitial critical position $r^c_i = (3/2)r_H$, where $r_H$ is the horizon radius\nfor which energy-density vanishes."}

The pixel\nproperties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel\ncapacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain,\nresponse nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised\nfor each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us\nto derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data\nquality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the\nmeasurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as\nderived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors\nEuclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted\nfor less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk\nbetween adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the\npixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the\nEuclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a\nvariation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise\nis approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout\nnoise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator\nnoise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic\nacquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80\nk$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are\nless than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial\nvariation and differences between detectors."}

This report presents an analysis of light\npollution data from the \\textit{Was het donker} SQM network from 2020 until\n2023, with a focus on indirect light pollution, commonly known as skyglow. By\nintegrating measurements from Sky Quality Meter (SQM) stations in the network\nand cloud cover data from EUMETSAT, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of\nnight sky brightness across a region encompassing northern Netherlands and the\nwestern part of the German Wadden Coast. Yearly changes in brightness for 27\nlocations were ranked and plotted, revealing that in the darkest areas, light\npollution is increasing at a rate of 2.78 to 6.68 percent per year. A trend\nemerged showing that brighter areas experienced lower variability in\nbrightness, while darker zones exhibited higher variability. This is due to the\ndominance of artificial light sources, such as street lighting, in brighter\nareas, which reduces the influence of natural light sources like the Moon,\nstars, and cloud backscatter. Seasonal patterns and the effects of the Milky\nWay were also investigated. Density plots were employed to visualize these\nchanges in night sky brightness, helping to identify specific sources of light\npollution, such as greenhouse lighting and streetlight turn-off times. These\nfindings emphasize the need for systematic monitoring of light pollution and\noffer valuable insights that can guide public awareness initiatives and inform\nlight pollution mitigation strategies."}

The goal of the GP\nmagnetometry investigation is to identify magnetic anomalies that cannot be\nreadily explained in terms of a natural or human-made origin, and analyze these\njointly with the data collected from the other modalities. These include an\nensemble of visible and infrared cameras, a broadband acoustic system and a\nweather-monitoring system. Here, we present GP's first geomagnetic variometer\nstation, deployed at the GP observatory in Colorado, USA. We describe the\ncalibration and deployment of the instrumentation, which consists of a vector\nmagnetometer and its data acquisition system, and the collection and processing\nof the data. Moreover, we present and discuss examples of the magnetic field\ndata obtained over a period of 6 months, including data recorded during the May\n2024 G5 extreme geomagnetic storm. We find that the data meet and even surpass\nthe requirements laid out in GP's Science Traceability Matrix. Key to the\nevaluation of our data is the proximity of the variometer station to the USGS\nmagnetic observatory in Boulder, Colorado. By comparing the two sets of data,\nwe find that they are of similar quality. Having established the proper\nfunctioning of the first GP variometer station, we will use it as the model for\nvariometer stations at future GP observatories."}

Accepted by RAS Techniques & Instruments", "summary": "Modelling carbon monoxide (CO) line radiation is computationally expensive\nfor traditional numerical solvers, especially when applied to complex,\nthree-dimensional stellar atmospheres. We present COEmuNet, a 3D convolutional\nneural network (CNN)-based surrogate model that emulates CO line radiation\ntransport with high accuracy and efficiency. It consists of an asymmetric\nencoder-decoder design that takes 3D hydrodynamical models as inputs and\ngenerates synthetic observations of evolved stellar atmospheres. The model is\ntrained on data from hydrodynamic simulations of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB)\nstars perturbed by a companion. Given a set of input parameters, including\nvelocity fields, kinetic temperature distribution, and CO molecular number\ndensities, the COEmuNet model emulates spectral line observations with a median\nrelative error of ~7% compared to a classical numerical solver of the radiative\ntransfer equation, measured over seven frequency channels and arbitrary viewing\ndirections. Besides, COEmuNet delivers a 1000 times speedup, enabling efficient\nmodel fitting to observational datasets, real-time visualization of simulations\nand progress toward integration in large-scale cosmological simulations."}

Our first publication (Lerner, P., A. Mayer, T. E. Sullivan. 2023. A\nnew method for the discovery of the distant exoplanets.

Slight modification of the HBT can determine its real part.\nSimultaneous observation of both characteristics, e.g. in a binocular setting\nof telescopes, is exceptionally sensitive to the asymmetry of the luminous\nobject. However, the issue of a very small signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HBT\nmakes application of this method difficult. In the current paper, we discuss\nthe possibilities to enhance the low SNR of the method."}

We explore the applications of these methods across diverse\ngravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter\nestimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and\nconducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed\nimprovements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their\nmodel-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to\ntheir widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of\nconventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter\nspaces and noise conditions."}
