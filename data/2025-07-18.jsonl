A full\nanalysis of the dynamic range of the beam over a wide range of conditions is\npresented. The dynamic range is bounded from below by the amplitude of\nvibration due to thermal motion and it is bounded from above by large amplitude\noscillations where the geometric nonlinearity plays a significant role due to\nstretching induced tension. The dynamics are analyzed using a beam with clamped\nboundaries, a string model, and a beam with hinged boundaries. The range of\nvalidity for the different models is quantified in detail. A hinged beam model\nis found to provide an accurate description, with insightful closed-form\nanalytical expressions, over a wide range of conditions. The relative\nimportance of bending and tension in the mode-dependent dynamics of the beam is\ndetermined. Bending is shown to be important for the higher modes of\noscillation with the onset of its importance dependent upon the amount of\nintrinsic tension that is present. The theoretical predictions are directly\ncompared with experimental measurements for the first ten modes of two\nnanoscale beams. We discuss the accuracy of these approaches and their use for\nthe development of emerging micro and nanoscale technologies that exploit the\nmultimodal dynamics of small elastic beams operating in the linear regime."}

In this work, we address these inconsistencies by improving the\nsecondary angular distributions of the (n,n) and (n,2n) reactions of beryllium,\nthereby making the theoretical calculations (C) and experimental results (E) of\nthese two series more consistent, and reducing the cumulative ${\\chi^2}$ value\nfrom 7.58 using the ENDF/B-VII.1 to 4.52.

The C/E values of the HMF-066 series are generally 230-330\npcm lower than those of the HMF-058 series, comparable to their experimental\nuncertainties of 200-400 pcm.

Non-linear electrodynamic black holes serve as\ntypical models for multi-event horizon black holes. Depending on the choice of\nmetric parameters, these black holes can possess more than five event horizons.\nConsequently, within certain parameter ranges, black holes can have more than\nthree photon spheres of varying sizes outside the event horizon. Specifically,\nwe focus on the strong gravitational lensing effects near the triple photon\nspheres, particularly the formation of higher-order images of point sources and\ncelestial spheres. The presence of one, two, or three or more photon spheres\nsignificantly increases the number of higher-order images of a point source.\nWhen a black hole is illuminated by a celestial sphere, the three photon\nspheres generate three critical curves in the black hole image, with the\nsmallest critical curve coinciding with the shadow's edge. Additionally, since\nnon-linear electrodynamic black holes are models of multi-event horizon black\nholes, we can infer the gravitational lensing effects and the changes in\ncelestial images for black holes with more than three photon spheres by\nanalyzing the distinctions and patterns between the gravitational lensing\neffects of one, two, and three photon spheres."}

We\nconsider a $\\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Induced (RGI) Schwarzschild\nblack hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified\nby the $\\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling\nconstant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of\nmassive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as\nthe radiated energy flux, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk\naround the $\\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that\nwhen non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce\na noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular,\nfor small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the\npeak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that\nquantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially\nin the inner regions close to the black hole."}

We\nobtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius\n$r_s$ and the DM density parameter $\\rho_s$ in both the weak and the strong\nfield regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match\nthe predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the\nS2 star data, obtaining upper limits on $r_s$ and $\\rho_s$. In the strong\nfield, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from\nfour microquasars (e.g., GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, and XTE\nJ1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime\ncurvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general\nrelativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model\nparameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies\nand the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also\nyielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined\ngeodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic\noscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a\npathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions\nin future analysis and observations."}

In this letter, we demonstrate the benefits of instead\ncomparing observable populations directly. In this approach, the domain of\nvalidity of the models is trivially respected, such that only the relevant\nparameter space regions as predicted by the astrophysical models of interest\ncontribute to the comparison. We clarify that unbiased inference of the\nobservable compact-binary population is indeed possible.
