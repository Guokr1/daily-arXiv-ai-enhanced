Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments\nof the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully\nhandling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation\nproblem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition\nthe RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well\nas the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate\nthe MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with\nan already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between\neach distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the\nsecond and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can\nfurthermore benefit from efficient initialization.

Since we\nanticipate such systems to exist within and be dynamically influenced by the\ngalactic center environment, we expect them to be instrumental in studying\nthese environments and testing our theories of gravity in the strong field\nregime. The gravitational waves associated with the EMRI motion fall within the\nmHz regime, making them target sources for future space-based detectors.\nHowever, because of the crowded nature of these galactic centers, these EMRIs\ncould be perturbed by other nearby orbiting bodies. In this work, we analyze\npotential perturbations in EMRIs due to a third-body perturber near resonance.\nWe use the formalism and code tools developed in the previous paper in this\nseries [Silva \\& Hirata, {\\slshape Phys.

We find that, after investigating nearly 142,000 resonant interactions\nacross a restricted set of 180 different simulated orbit systems, none cause\nchanges to the EMRI dynamics beyond a perturbative correction, but could lead\nto potentially large changes in the phase of the waveform of order 0.1 radian.\nDetectable phase changes in the waveform induced by third-body perturbers could\nbe a common occurrence and will require careful consideration for developing\naccurate EMRI waveform models. This analysis suggests that our formalism and\npipeline are robust enough to handle a wide variety of resonances from various\nperturbing orbit configurations around the EMRI, which will aid in developing\nmore accurate waveform models to better probe galactic center environments and\ntest theories of gravity using gravitational wave observations of EMRIs."}

In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an\nelectric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this\nanalogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components\nof perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that\nduality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields\nconstitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the\nassociated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the\ndifference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized\ncomponents of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and\nanti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when\nthe gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We\nthen investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality\nsymmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it\nis anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between\nright- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum.

An important question that arises within this framework is how\nrapidly the series converges. For those classical observables, which are\nprimarily determined by the geometry near the peak of the effective potential,\nit has been previously shown that the series converges remarkably fast, often\nwithin the first two orders. However, this rapid convergence does not extend to\nquantities such as Hawking radiation, which are highly sensitive to the\ngeometry near the event horizon. Although each successive order yields a result\nthat is significantly closer to that of the full infinite series, several terms\nare typically required to obtain a sufficiently accurate approximation of the\nregular black hole in this context."}
