White paper submission to the \"Key Non-Polar\n  Destinations Across the Moon to Address Decadal-level Science Objectives with\n  Human Explorers\" input call", "summary": "Exoplanets with and without a magnetic field are predicted to form, behave,\nand evolve very differently. Therefore, there is great need to directly\nconstrain these fields to holistically understand the properties of exoplanets\nincluding their potential habitability. This goal aligns with the Astro2020\nDecadal Survey recommendations. Observing planetary auroral radio emissions is\namong the most promising detection methods, but decades of searching have yet\nto yield a conclusive detection, though promising hints are now emerging from\nground-based radio telescopes. However, these ground-based efforts are\nfundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency\nsignals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In\nthis white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing\nthe unique environment of the Moon. We discuss how the upcoming LuSEE-Night and\nROLSES pathfinder missions will study our Solar System's planets as exoplanet\nanalogs and place the first meaningful upper limits on exoplanetary radio flux\nbelow 10 MHz. Furthermore, we explore the revolutionary potential of the\nproposed future lunar arrays FarView and FARSIDE. For example, FarView will be\nsensitive enough to study the magnetic fields of a diverse set of exoplanets\n(super-Earths to gas giants) and an order of magnitude more Jupiter-like\nplanets than ground-based telescopes, providing crucial tests for dynamo\ntheory. Most significantly, FARSIDE will be able to detect the magnetospheres\nof nearby terrestrial exoplanets, offering a powerful synergy with atmospheric\ncharacterization efforts by JWST and HWO to fully assess their potential\nhabitability. By opening this unexplored low-frequency window, radio astronomy\nfrom the Moon is poised to transform the field of exoplanet magnetospheric\nscience. [Abridged]"}

Achieving optimal converter performance\nrequires resonators with high quality factor ($Q$), strong electromechanical\ncoupling ($k^2$), high power handling capability, and a spurious-free response.\nLithium niobate (LN) has emerged as a promising material in this context due to\nits high figure of merit (FoM = $Q \\cdot k^2$). While previous studies on\nsingle-layer LN resonators have demonstrated high FoM values, they typically\noperate at relatively low resonance frequencies ($f_s$). Recently, periodically\npoled piezoelectric film (P3F) structures, formed by stacking piezoelectric\nlayers with alternating crystal orientations, have shown the potential to both\nscale up the operating frequency and enhance the FoM compared to single-layer\ncounterparts in piezoelectric power conversion.

The main purpose of\nthis paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments\nassuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In\naddition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in\ncausal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like\ngeometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is\na three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and\nfuture corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum\ntheory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that\nfactorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and\nits two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and\nboundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we\nexplain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states\naccording to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the\nresulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge\nconservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and\ndiscussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our\nproposal in practice."}

While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine\nneutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations\nin accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in\npredicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response,\nthis research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in\ncharacterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action\nand incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical\nrelevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study,\nthereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under\nextreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the\nAV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and\npressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its\ntrace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift\nfunction, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds.\nAdditionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are\nexamined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific\nvalues of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the\nmodel. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational\ncollapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the\nproposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl\ninequality is satisfied as well."}

Steinhardt"], "title": "Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe", "comment": "39 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based\non components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under\nperturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the\nstring scale and string coupling $g_s \\ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic\nevolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a\nperturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a\nsecond field that becomes massless at $\\phi= \\phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an\nenhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the\nway to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs)\n- fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the\nstring mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the\nNull Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string\ncoupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In\nturn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and\ninitiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition\ninto slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic\nsingularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and\nrobustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of\nprimordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background."}

The boosted black hole is obtained from a\ngeneral twisting metric whose boost emerges from the BMS group. Employing a\nstandard procedure we build the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor with the\nKerr boosted metric together with its timelike Killing vector as the\nelectromagnetic potential. We demonstrate that our solution satisfies Einstein\nfield equations up to a fourth-order expansion in $1/r$, indicating that the\nspacetime closely resembles a Kerr-Newman black hole whose boost points in a\narbitrary direction. Spacetime structures of the general black hole -- namely\nthe event horizon and ergosphere -- are examined in Bondi-Sachs coordinates.\nFor a proper timelike observer we show that the electric field generated by the\nboosted black hole exhibits a purely radial behavior, whereas the magnetic\nfield develops a complex structure characterized by two pronounced lobes\noriented opposite to the boost direction."}
