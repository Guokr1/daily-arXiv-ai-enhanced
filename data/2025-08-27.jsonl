However, achieving precise control over ion transport remains a\nmajor challenge. In this work, we introduce a MoS2 SiN hybrid nanochannel\narchitecture that enables electrical tuning of ionic transport via external\ngating, and we examine its potential for osmotic power generation and single\nmolecule detection. To fabricate the channels, we employed a combined focused\nion beam (FIB) milling and dry transfer method, producing sub 10 nm thick\nstructures while preserving the structural integrity and electronic properties\nof MoS2, essential for reliable surface charge modulation. We first\ninvestigated how the gate voltage influences ionic conductance, finding\nevidence of gate dependent modulation of ion selectivity under different bias\npolarities. Next, by applying a salt concentration gradient across the\nnanochannels, we demonstrated the feasibility of this platform for osmotic\nenergy harvesting. Finally, we tested the system for single molecule sensing,\nshowing that linearized bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced translocation\nsignals with notably long dwell times.

We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the\nwhole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented\na neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in\nthe RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag\nsource term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a\nRiemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical\ndust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the\ncapacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse\ndown to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large\ndust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The\nspatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust\nenrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the\nenvelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial\nturbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal\nvelocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it\nto regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the\ncoupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the\ndynamical scales.

Unlike Terrestrial GW detectors, the quiet seismic environment of\nthe Moon does not impede detection in this band; in fact the ground motions of\nthe Moon will be excited by GWs, making the Moon a resonant amplifier at low\nfrequencies. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be\nlimited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies.\nBy taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first\nphase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to\nstudy astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range. The\nadvanced phase of the mission, LILA Horizon, would increase GW sensitivity to\nthe cosmological horizon in this band."}

This approach, however, is less physically\nmotivated: $\\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de\nSitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a\nglobal timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this\nwork, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\\sigma$ is\nvaried in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically\nstable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density\n$T^{(\\sigma)}_{\\mu\\nu}=-\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu}$, corresponding to a negative\npressure $P_\\sigma=-\\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically\nflat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby\navoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying\n$\\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\\sigma\\,\\delta P_\\sigma$ in the first law,\nwith $V_\\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\\pi r_h^3/3$ for a\nstatic spherical black hole.

Our results establish that extended\nblack hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises\nconsistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension,\nproviding a new setting for black hole chemistry."}

By replacing conventional activation functions\nwith learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher\naccuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks.\nLeveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which\ningests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model\nweights of tens of kilobytes.
