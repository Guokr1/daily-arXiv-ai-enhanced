Comments are welcome", "summary": "The nominal duration of Euclid's main mission is six years, but current best\nestimates indicate that the observatory has sufficient propellant to operate\nfor up to ~14 years in total. In this work, we advocate dedicating six of these\n~8 additional years to repeating the main survey, covering approximately\none-third of the sky. This repetition would not only improve the sampling,\nsignal-to-noise, quality, and depth of the survey, but -- most importantly --\nwould provide a six-year time baseline between two epochs if executed in the\nsame sequence. The availability of multiple epochs would enable the derivation\nof proper motions for stars as faint as V~27, i.e., more than five magnitudes\nfainter than those measured by the Gaia mission. Although it may seem early to\npropose such a mission extension, in this work we quantitatively illustrate its\nimmense scientific potential. We therefore intend to initiate the technical and\nscientific discussions early to ensure optimal planning. The here proposed\nextension would employ only the VIS channel -- owing to its superior\nastrometric capability and depth -- while simultaneously using NISP in\nslitless-spectroscopy mode to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of first-epoch\nspectra that would also benefit of proper motions to identify and reject\nobjects within the local Universe."}

In anomaly\ndetection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data\npoints. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single,\nuser-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for\nthe complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we\nintroduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly\nDetection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find\nnovelties.\n  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different\ngeometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance\nmetrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score\nthat is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this\nmulti-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery\non astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C.\nRubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the\nZwicky Transient Facility.\n  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection --\nanomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other\nstate-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes\ndiscovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs\nsimilarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability.

By\nadopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different\napproaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced\nparticle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible\nthermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor\nformulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle\ncreation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that\nirreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration\nthrough a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the\ncosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second\nlaw of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon\nand enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter\nphase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics.\nFurthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of\nmatter creation processes.

This provides\nphysical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it\nis the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we\nconsider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter\nstate in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter\nthermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\\pi$. This\ntemperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local\nactivation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter\nenvironment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon.
