We show that graph-based machine learning emulators can learn the spatiotemporal evolution of electromagnetic fields and lower order moments of ion velocity distribution in the near-Earth space environment from four 5D Vlasiator runs performed with identical steady solar wind conditions. The initial ion number density is systematically varied, while the grid spacing is held constant, to scan the ratio of the characteristic ion skin depth to the numerical grid size. Using a graph neural network architecture operating on the 2D spatial simulation grid comprising 670k cells, we demonstrate that both a deterministic forecasting model (Graph-FM) and a probabilistic ensemble forecasting model (Graph-EFM) based on a latent variable formulation are capable of producing accurate predictions of future plasma states. A divergence penalty is incorporated during training to encourage divergence-freeness in the magnetic fields and improve physical consistency. For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty."}

We model these phenomena from first principles and develop simple computational simulations of their collective behaviors. Additionally, we describe tabletop experiments to accompany these problems, either as in-class demonstrations or lab activities. Throughout, we draw connections to broader physical principles in soft condensed matter and fluids, allowing the real-world example of the cranberry bog to serve as a bridge between the undergraduate curriculum and topics in soft matter research."}

This gravitational framework accounts for a massive graviton while ensuring the absence of ghost instabilities during propagation. The BEC stellar configuration in this study was obtained by determining the solutions characterized by static and spherical symmetric metric. This study provides a detailed account of the stellar structure, highlighting the roles played by massive gravity and the Kuchowicz metric through a combination of analytical and numerical solutions. Our work specifically utilizes the Colpi-Wasserman-shapiro (CWS) and Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations of state (EoS) to model the internal thermodynamic behavior of the BEC. We have evaluated the physical viability of the BEC stellar framework by analyzing the energy conditions, and the EoS parameter along with the gradients of the energy-momentum tensor. The stability criteria such as the study of surface redshift, adiabatic index and squared sound velocity were utilized to confirm that our proposed model is both stable and physically consistent. Hence, this study offers a definitive structural analysis of the BEC stars, providing precise results in this massive gravity environment."}

To reduce the high computational cost, various fast machine learning surrogate models have been proposed. Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality. AllShowers marks a significant step towards a universal model for calorimeter shower simulations in collider experiments."}

CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10.

Here, we investigate guided surface acoustic wave phononic four-wave mixing at gigahertz frequencies in an aluminum scandium nitride/4H-silicon carbide heterostructure operated at both room temperature (295 K) and cryogenic temperature (4 K). The 500 nm thick aluminum scandium nitride film supports guided Rayleigh and Sezawa modes with distinct displacement and strain energy density distributions, allowing a direct comparison of mode-dependent nonlinear behavior within the same device. Continuous-wave four-wave mixing measurements reveal an enhancement in the extracted modal nonlinear coefficient at 4 K relative to 295 K for both modes. In addition, the Rayleigh mode exhibits a modal nonlinearity approximately two orders of magnitude larger than that of the Sezawa mode across both temperature regimes. These results demonstrate that phononic four-wave mixing is strongly influenced by temperature, mode confinement, and strain localization while establishing aluminum scandium nitride on silicon carbide heterostructures as a promising platform for engineering enhanced nonlinear phononic interactions for future classical and quantum acoustic on-chip signal processing systems."}

In this context, the DNA Origami technique, with its high addressability, enables both the assembly of plasmonic nanostructures with nanometric accuracy, and the deterministic placement of a single analyte molecule precisely at the generated hotspot within them. To date, most DNA Origami based nanoantennas rely on gold or silver nanoparticles (NPs), whose plasmonic resonances are confined to the visible spectrum, severely limiting their use in other spectral ranges. To extend the operating range, we have recently established a robust strategy for self-assembling programmable ultraviolet (UV)-plasmonic dimer antennas using rhodium nanocubes.

Although formal monotonicity of the Hawking mass under smooth inverse mean curvature flow is well established in the Riemannian setting, comparatively little is known about the robustness of this behavior in discrete numerical implementations applied to explicitly embedded surfaces away from exact symmetry. We consider surfaces defined by small spherical harmonic perturbations of a round sphere and evolve them under an in-slice, time-flat flow analogous to inverse mean curvature flow. We examine the behaviour of the Hawking mass under the flow and find that monotonicity persists for a class of nonspherical perturbations and is robust under variations in perturbation amplitude and angular frequency. We also identify regimes in which numerical instabilities arise, highlighting practical challenges associated with extending such flows beyond simple symmetry assumptions. These results provide a concrete computational testbed for future investigations of uniformly expanding flows and quasi-local mass in more general spacetime settings."}

To improve the efficiency of a packed-bed SHS system through second law analysis (SLA), we developed macroscopic entropy and exergy transport equations for fluid flow and heat transfer in porous media based on microscopic transport equations. These equations enable us to identify where and how much exergy is destroyed. Using a packed-bed SHS system developed at the PROMES-CNRS laboratory as a test case, we demonstrated how to apply SLA to optimize an SHS system. Our analysis revealed that, in addition to exit and heat leakage losses at tank surfaces, thermal and solid conduction losses inside the tank significantly contribute to total loss in the studied SHS system. These internal losses occur close to the thermocline. However, their slower transport causes a delay in their emergence. The SLA suggests an optimal tank aspect ratio of D/H = 0.75, at which the total exergy loss coefficient reaches its minimum value when exit loss is not considered. As particle size decreases, the exergy loss coefficient also decreases due to enhanced heat transfer between the fluid and solid phases. The pressure loss for the studied SHS system is negligible. The SLA favors a truncated cone-shaped tank with a slightly larger upper surface. Through the SLA, the exergy loss coefficient is reduced from 4.9% for the original design to 4.1% for the optimized design. This study demonstrates that, when used in conjunction with energy analysis, the SLA is an effective tool for optimizing energy storage systems."}

For the case $ω< -3/2$, where energy conditions are violated and bouncing solutions exist classically, we demonstrate that quantum backreaction effects significantly smooth the bounce of directional scale factors, with the bounce occurring at scales set by the quantum state width. For the conformally invariant case $ω= -3/2$, quantum corrections cause scale factors to enter accelerated expansion phases more rapidly than in the classical limit. Most significantly, we show that cross-correlation terms between canonical variables are essential for obtaining physically consistent effective dynamics: neglecting these terms leads to spurious divergences and unphysical behavior. When correlations are included, small-amplitude oscillations appear shortly after the bounce, rapidly damping to classical trajectories. We interpret these oscillations as quantum remnant effects encoding information about correlations between gravitational and scalar field degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that cross-correlations carry crucial quantum information that substantially influences cosmological dynamics, with implications for quantum gravity phenomenology near singularities.

With the 4.8 um pixel pitch of the sensor, this is a focal length of about 77.5 mm. To accommodate range variations due to vehicle pose and surface topography, the Microscopic Camera has a focus mechanism to give it a depth of field (DOF) of about 130mm. Since the Microscopic Camera's boresight is tilted by 52° off the vertical, the optical configuration has a compensating tilted focal plane, taking advantage of the Scheimpflug imaging principle. The optics are all-refractive with nine elements, a six-element stationary group and a three-element moving group. A plano-plano window seals the optics from the environment and also serves as the substrate for a bandpass filter. The optomechanical system is derived from the Mars Hand Lens Imager [11]; the moving group is mounted to a linear slide which is translated via a cam follower by the rotation of a cam driven by a stepper motor. The Microscopic Camera is designed to survive at temperatures as low as -130C without power. The camera is enclosed in a cavity in the foam insulation covering the spacecraft and looking through a single-pane window. Prior to imaging, the camera will be heated to operating temperature (nominal -30C) for proper actuation of the mechanism.

However, realistic systems with gain are inherently saturable and nonlinear, thereby invalidating linear assumptions, and when $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is broken the coupled resonator system becomes unstable, hence it seems that the best working regime is to use such instability to make an SS-EPD-based oscillator. We study the saturated steady-state of a general system of two coupled oscillators with saturable nonlinear gain.

In general, unlike linear systems, we find that at SS, the sensitivity of the oscillation frequency to exhibit linear, square-root, or cube-root dependence on small perturbations.

For the first model, characterized by power-law couplings and an ansatz linking the Proca field to the Hubble parameter, we analytically demonstrate the existence of a critical point in the pressure-volume$(P-V)$ diagram, indicating a $P-V$ phase transition.

We show that, while the efficiency remains nearly identical to that reported in our last paper, the addition of the third station allows more photon data to be recorded simultaneously, and therefore we can build up the photon-bunching peak in the data stream in fewer hours on sky for an unresolved source. In the second part of the paper, we report our observations to date of the nearby red giant star, Arcturus, most of which occurred in the first half of 2025.

Among these, the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted MPGD technologies. Despite their widespread adoption, GEM detectors based on the conventional bi-conical hole geometry do not always achieve optimal performance, particularly in maximizing effective gain while suppressing ion backflow. One of the primary factors limiting a GEM's performance is ion backflow. The accumulation and gradual discharge of these ions might alter the local electric field, resulting in a temporary dead time and complicating responses to subsequent events. These limitations pose challenges for applications requiring high precision and stable long-term operation. In this work, we address these issues by investigating modified GEM geometries designed to enhance gain performance and reduce ion backflow, thereby improving overall detector performance. The current study investigates geometric optimization strategies for a triple-GEM detector to enhance performance, mitigate ion backflow, and augment gain. The detector structures were designed using the ANSYS Mechanical APDL, and the associated electrostatic field configurations were computed using the ANSYS Maxwell. A thorough investigation of gain and ion backflow calculations was carried out when the generated field maps were interfaced with Garfield$^{++}$.

This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution."}

Methods for measuring radon emanation are well-established but have predominantly focused on the 222Rn isotope, the dominant radon isotope for these backgrounds. However, measurements of 220Rn (thoron), the second most abundant radon isotope, remain relatively unexplored. 220Rn emanation measurements are challenging because the 220Rn must be transferred from the emanation chamber to the active detector within its short 55 s half-life. In this study, a direct in-chamber approach for measuring 220Rn emanation is presented in which the sample is placed directly within the active detector chamber, thereby minimising losses during transfer. The method was demonstrated with a DURRIDGE RAD8 electrostatic radon detector, which measured 220Rn emanation from low-activity thoriated rods with an activity of 76 +/- 20 mBq. Compared with a conventional flowthrough 220Rn emanation setup, the in-chamber method increased sensitivity by a factor of 3. Using helium as the carrier gas provided a further sensitivity increase, giving an overall sensitivity gain of ~5. These results indicate that in-chamber 220Rn emanation measurements provide an effective tool for low-background experiments and have the potential to accelerate radon studies by exploiting the shorter half-life of 220Rn."}

Designed for image generation, VQ-VAEs are trained to reconstruct the input dataset via a low-dimensional discrete embedding. VQ-VAEs effectively learn the distribution of training data, where samples that do not fit the distribution well yield the highest reconstruction errors. This property makes VQ-VAEs a good candidate for the task of anomaly detection. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of VQ-VAEs in identifying radio continuum sources with anomalous structures in the image-plane domain. We find VQ-VAEs to be useful as part of a solution for searching such large datasets. We observe that they are able to remove a majority of the typical sources in such data, even when trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabelled data. We also provide our testing set of a large sample of manually labelled radio sources, in particular radio galaxies, taken from the MGCLS at 1.28 GHz. Automated approaches to searching through high volumes of data are key in extracting the full scientific potential of the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders."}

Motivated by lensing or scattering, one often ``modulates'' a plane electromagnetic wave by a weak transverse envelope $1+γf(x,y)$. We show that, within the aligned null pp--wave ansatz ($A_v=0$, no $v$--dependence, $F_{xy}=0$) and enforcing the source--free Maxwell equations to $\\mathcal O(γ)$, a generic profile $f(x,y)$ is incompatible with Maxwell: the transverse field $F_{ui}$ must be both divergence--free and curl--free on the transverse plane, hence $F_{ui}=\\partial_iΦ$ with $Δ_\\perpΦ=0$.\n  We give a minimal, polarization--agnostic gauge completion of the modulated potential and prove a cancellation theorem: under standard decay/regularity (or zero--mode) conditions that exclude additional harmonic transverse modes, all $\\mathcal O(γ)$ dependence on $f$ drops out of $F_{ui}$ and therefore out of the electrovac source $T_{uu}$. Consequently, the electromagnetic contribution to the Brinkmann profile is universal at $\\mathcal O(γ)$: the familiar cycle--averaged isotropic $r^2$ term plus an isotropic oscillatory correction at frequency $2ω$, present only for non-circular polarisation. We isolate the residual Maxwell--admissible freedom as harmonic (holomorphic) transverse data and, by Kerr--Schild linearity, superpose an arbitrary co--propagating vacuum gravitational pp--wave, relating TT--gauge strain to Brinkmann amplitudes.

In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI."}

We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset.

The linear perturbation analysis is performed in the background Æther-orthogonal frame, in which the axes of the gravitational wave sound cones remain perpendicular to these hypersurfaces, thereby simplifying the analysis. The leading-order results show that Einstein-Æther theory admits two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode, consistent with the findings in the flat spacetime background. We further derive the dispersion relations and linear stability conditions for these modes in curved backgrounds. At next-to-leading order, we obtain the amplitude evolution equations, finding that the graviton number is conserved for the tensor modes but not for the vector and scalar modes. Next-to-leading-order effects also induce mixing among polarization modes. Our study demonstrates that, after imposing the GW170817 constraint on the propagation speed of gravitational waves, the vector modes mixed with the leading-order tensor modes cannot be used to distinguish between general relativity and Einstein-Æther theory. On the other hand, the mixing between scalar modes and the leading-order tensor modes leads to distinct predictions in the two theories, providing a promising avenue to test Einstein-Æther gravity through the detection of polarization mixing in gravitational waves."}

The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors."}

To address this point, we constrain deviations from general relativity across the plunge-merger-ringdown stage of spin-precessing binaries with a parametrized waveform model within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that deviations from the peak gravitational-wave amplitude and instantaneous frequency of the $(\\ell, |m|)=(2,2)$ mode are constrained to about $10\\%$ and $4\\%$, respectively, at $90\\%$ credible level. These constraints are, respectively, two and four times more stringent than those obtained by analyzing GW150914. We also constrain, for the first time, the instantaneous frequency of the $(\\ell, |m|)=(4,4)$ mode at merger to about $6\\%$, and the time at which the gravitational-wave amplitude peaks to about $5~\\mathrm{ms}$.

By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation."}

In this theory, the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated with metric perturbations of polar and axial parities (\"isospectrality\") of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity no longer holds. How does this loss of isospectrality translate into the time-domain ringdown of gravitational waves? Given such a ringdown, can we identify the two \"fundamental quasinormal modes\" associated to the two metric-perturbation parities? We study these questions through a large suite of time-domain numerical simulations, by a prescription on how to relate the gauge-invariant master functions that describe metric perturbations of each parity with the gravitational polarizations. Under the assumptions made in our calculations, we find that it is in general difficult to identify either of the two fundamental modes from the time series, although finding evidence for a non-general-relativistic mode is possible sometimes.

The regularized metric replaces $r^2$ by $r^2+σ^2$ in the angular part, where $σ$ is the resolution scale from the width of the Gaussian probe. The resulting Gaussian curvature integrates to $-2π$, independently of $σ$, and including the boundary contribution, yields Euler characteristic $χ=0$, corresponding to a punctured plane. This curvature defines an effective stress-energy source with total energy $E_{\\text{eff}}=-1/(4G)$, universal and $σ$-independent. Spatial slices embed isometrically as helicoids, and geodesics exhibit a characteristic swirling motion. These results show that finite spatial resolution measurement does not merely smooth singularities but imprints topological defects with fixed physical consequences, suggesting that observational limitations fundamentally shape spacetime geometry. We show how our Gabor regularisation is extendable to $(3+1)$ Minkowski space-time."}

We compute the quasinormal mode spectra by making use of two numerical techniques: direct integration and matrix values continued fraction methods. An excellent agreement is found between two approaches, confirming the robustness of our computation. We present the fundamental quasinormal frequencies for both gravitational and dilaton modes and analyze their dependence on the magnetic charge ($Q_m$), angular momentum quantum number $(l)$, and coupling parameter ($ε=α-β$).

Determining how much deformation remains at present is crucial for gravitational-wave astronomy. This study is the first investigation into the evolution of quadrupole deformation during the solid crust formation phase to obtain a plausible value at present. The equilibrium structure before solidification is modeled using a fluid description, and the deformation is introduced through an assumed driving force. As the star cools, this force weakens, leading to a gradual decay of the deformation. Eventually, the deformation vanishes in the fluid region but partially remains in the crust, sustained by elastic forces, after solidification. By comparing the equilibrium models before and after solidification, we estimate the residual ellipticity and demonstrate that the spatial profile of the elastic shear is imprinted in the crust. The relic ellipticity is only a few percent of the original value, with its absolute magnitude depending on the deformation mechanism during the hot era, which cannot be specified owing to the lack of elaborate models. This work provides a first step toward linking early neutron star deformation with future gravitational-wave observations."}

Kephart"], "title": "Cosmological Budget of Entropy from Merging Black Holes", "comment": "15 pages, 7 figures, submitted", "summary": "Black holes contain more entropy than any other component of the observable universe. Gravitational-wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have shown evidence of a previously unknown black hole mass range, which provides new information to update the entropy budget. Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an ``entropy floor\" in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy."}

Lobos"], "title": "Thermodynamics and Gravitational Signatures of Rotating Black Holes in the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle", "comment": "11 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "We investigate the phenomenological implications of quantum gravity on rotating black holes within the framework of the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP), which incorporates both minimal length (ultraviolet) and large-scale (infrared) corrections. Lacking a full non-perturbative formulation of quantum gravity, we adopt a metric-based approach. We construct a stationary, axisymmetric ansatz via the Newman-Janis algorithm to model the kinematic features of a rotating black hole subject to Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP) corrections. The thermodynamic analysis reveals that in the infrared-dominated regime, the Hawking temperature scales as $T_H \\sim M^{-3}$, leading to a rapid cooling phase that significantly prolongs the lifetime of supermassive black holes. We derive the modified Teukolsky Master Equation for gravitational perturbations and demonstrate that the background geometry preserves the isospectrality between axial and polar modes. In the eikonal limit, the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum exhibits orthogonal shifts: the minimal length parameter $β$ induces a spectral blueshift and enhanced damping, while the large-scale parameter $α$ induces a spectral redshift and suppressed damping. Finally, we constrain the theory using observational data from LIGO/Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. We establish that the shadow of M87* is approximately $10^6$ times more sensitive to large-scale corrections than Sgr A*, placing stringent bounds on the EUP parameter, while gravitational wave spectroscopy provides complementary constraints on the GUP sector."}

By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation."}

Requiring that the coefficient of such corrections be absolutely consistent with gravitational wave observational results validating the Hawking Area Theorem for binary black hole coalescences, implies constraints on parameters of F(R) gravity.

Rubin"], "title": "Multidimensional arrow of time", "comment": "10 pages", "summary": "This paper studies the effect of extra dimensions on the arrow of time within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We demonstrate that the observed irreversibility of physical processes can be explained by the monotonic growth of the extra-dimensional space. Unlike traditional cosmological approaches, our model does not link the arrow of time to the entropy of matter or radiation; rather, it identifies it with the Bekenstein-Hawking-Wald entropy of the geometric background. We establish a formal relation between the volume of the multidimensional manifold and the statistical weights of its geometric states. This leads to a fundamental relationship where the flow of time is intrinsically linked to the growth of multidimensional entropy.\n  A key consequence of our framework is that the arrow of time remains a persistent feature for a 4D observer situated on a brane, even in the complete absence of matter or radiation. This directionality is driven by the dominant entropy production in the higher-dimensional bulk, which dominates local statistical fluctuations and ensures a stable causal direction."}

We show that non-trivial peculiar velocity fields can be generated through Lorentzian boosts in the non-relativistic limit, where the Eulerian frame is obtained from analytic solutions of Einstein's equations sourced by an irrotational shear-free fluid with nonzero energy flux. This approach provides a physically viable interpretation of these analytic solutions, which (in general) admit no isometries, thus allowing, in principle, for modeling time and space varying 3-dimensional fields of peculiar velocities that can be contrasted with observational data on our local cosmography. As a ``proof of concept'' we examine the peculiar velocities of varying dark matter and dark energy perfect fluids with respect to the CMB frame using a simple, spherically symmetric particular solution. The resulting peculiar velocities are qualitatively compatible with observational data on the CMB dipole."}

However, template-based search cannot detect astrophysical sources that lack accurate waveform models, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star glitches, and cosmic strings. Here, we present a novel approach for template-free search using coincident anomaly detection (CoAD). CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10. The fully-unsupervised nature of CoAD makes it especially well-suited for next-generation detectors with greater sensitivity and associated increases in GW event rates."}

In the proposed design, all seismic isolation systems are housed in raise-bore wells drilled upward from the main tunnel toward an upper service tunnel. The pre-isolators for the most sensitive optics are located in the service tunnel, seating directly on strong and compact rock, while the other filters are distributed along the wells within compact, side-access vacuum chambers. Shorter, separate wells accommodate the seismic isolation systems for less demanding optics. This configuration provides substantial advantages: easier lock acquisition and improved robustness of the interferometers, lower-frequency pendulum stages, reduced congestion around the test masses, simplified installation and maintenance, improved vacuum partitioning, strong physical decoupling between the high- and low-frequency interferometers, and enhanced compatibility with future advances of Newtonian-noise cancellation. A novel technique for real-time, precision monitoring of rock motion and tilt provides a new signal for Newtonian noise cancellation and enables correction of seismic disturbances even during earthquakes, offering unique geophysical measurement capabilities."}
