However, superconducting qubits are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, while spin ensembles require finite fields for control, creating a major integration challenge. In this work, we demonstrate the first experimental setup that satisfies these constraints and provides verified qubit stability. Our cryogenic setup comprises two spatially and magnetically decoupled sample volumes inside a single dilution refrigerator: one hosting flux-tunable superconducting qubits and the other a spin ensemble equipped with a superconducting solenoid generating fields up to 50 mT. We show that several layers of Cryophy shielding and an additional superconducting aluminum shield suppress magnetic crosstalk by more than eight orders of magnitude, ensuring stability of the qubit's performance. Moreover, the operation of the solenoid adds minimal thermal load on the relevant stages of the dilution refrigerator. Our results enable scalable hybrid quantum architectures with low-loss integration, marking a key step toward scalable hybrid quantum computing platforms."}

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}

Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions."}

Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with \"hair\"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity."}

The 2009 solution is based on an average polynomial correction for each IR quadrant and is found to be poorly constrained at high fluence levels (e-) approaching the saturation limit. Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant). Because the new solution tends to make sources brighter, we recalibrate the five HST flux standards used to compute the IR zeropoints and find a negligible impact (0.1-0.2%) on the published values by Calamida et al. (2024), smaller than the RMS dispersion (0.5%) in the observed to synthetic flux ratios for all five flux standards.

The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves."}

The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \\texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \\texttt{PhenomXAS} and \\texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \\texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \\texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation."}

In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes."}

Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement\". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations.

More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\\mathbb{R}\\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$."}

In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics."}

The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \\texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \\texttt{PhenomXAS} and \\texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \\texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \\texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation."}

Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos."}

We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(ζ_c \\sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations."}

One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters."}

The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations."}

In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network."}

Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches."}

In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys."}
