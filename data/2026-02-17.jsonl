As part of the CSNS-II upgrade project, a High-Energy Proton Beam Telescope (HEPTel) based on monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) has been designed for the forthcoming High-Energy Proton Experimental Station (HPES), which will provide 0.8 to 1.6 GeV single-particle proton beams. HEPTel consists of six ultra-thin telescope modules, with a material budget per module of about 0.061% X0. Simulated with a 1.6 GeV proton beam, the telescope is expected to achieve a resolution of about 1.83 micrometers. Additionally, a dedicated readout electronics system and a Data Acquisition (DAQ) system have been designed for HEPTel, based on which a preliminary test system was established for beam tests. The beam test results with 1.3 GeV electrons demonstrated a single-module resolution of about 5.77 micrometers, an overall telescope resolution of about 2.70 micrometers, and a detection efficiency above 99.5%. These results validate the HEPTel design and confirm its capability for forthcoming proton-beam experiments at HPES."}

This balancing is due to the shear-induced linear non-modal dynamics of Alfvén waves, including their transient growth and over-reflection. This linear route to balancing turbulence is new -- fundamentally different from nonlinear ones operative in shearless MHD turbulence -- and have direct implications for understanding balanced/imbalanced MHD turbulence in the solar wind, which is modeled as a shear flow in a thermodynamically complex plasma."}

While gravitational effects on neutrinos are well studied in general relativity and torsion based geometries, the symmetric teleparallel regime where gravity stems solely from non-metricity, with zero curvature and torsion has remained uncharted. In this work, we perform the first analysis of neutrino oscillations in such a spacetime. Using the reduced Kerr metric in coincident gauge for the slowly rotating and weakly gravitating spherical Sun, we derive the Dirac Hamiltonian from the generalized Dirac equation and compute the accumulated phase of neutrino mass eigenstates. There are six free coupling constants in our model. Based on certain observational inputs, we inferred upper bounds on our arbitrary coupling constants. This allowed us to simplify the otherwise cumbersome calculations to some extent. Ultimately, we computed the phase differences that play a crucial role in solar neutrino oscillations and analyzed the contributions arising from our arbitrary coupling constants. Our results establish neutrino oscillations as a novel probe of non-metricity and open a new avenue for testing symmetric teleparallel gravity through astrophysical observations."}

Despite the large number of experimental works divulging the use of graphene in anticorrosion coatings, there is no report on the numerical modelling and simulation of the relationships between the orientation of graphene sheets in composite coatings and the introduced corrosion protection efficiency, to our knowledge. Herein, it is tried to model the influence of the orientation of graphene sheets dispersed in organic coatings on the diffusivity and flux of corrosive substances besides the corrosion initiation time of the protected substrates. To discover the relationship between the graphene orientation and corrosion-related phenomena, this study introduces a novel model consisting of a trigonometric factor named unprotected projected surface area proportion, which calculates corrosion-related parameters based on the principal Fick's laws. The model reveals that the decrease in the angle between graphene sheets and the substrate is highly beneficial for postponing the corrosion onset. It is accordingly estimated that a mismatch angle of 10 degree can slow down the diffusion process significantly and delay the corrosion initiation by around 65 times in a 100 micron thick epoxy/graphene composite coating in comparison to the counterpart with the perpendicular alignment. The predicted corrosion parameters were in a good agreement with the experimental data, indicating the merit of the proposed model. Thus, this model can be further employed as the fundamental of future research on the optimum graphene orientation in anticorrosion composite coatings."}

Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes."}

To fully exploit their nonlinear behavior for inverse design, it is essential to learn the full stress-strain response rather than relying on bulk quantities, motivating the use of neural operators for function-to-function mapping. However, data-driven modeling of nonlinear response for metamaterials is severely constrained by the limited availability of costly experimental data. Here, we propose a Bayesian multi-fidelity deep operator network that aggregates abundant low-fidelity finite element simulations with sparse high-fidelity experimental data from in-situ nanomechanical experiments on spinodal metamaterials, enabling heterogeneous information aggregation. A hybrid Bayesian active learning strategy is introduced to select informative samples by jointly maximizing epistemic uncertainty and geometric diversity of the microstructure, substantially reducing the cost of 3D nonlinear simulations. This approach adaptively trains the low-fidelity operator, which is then augmented by a high-fidelity Bayesian residual learner. We demonstrate that only 22 strategically selected samples from a design pool of 3000 are sufficient to achieve an 84.1 percent reduction in MSE compared to the high-fidelity baseline. The framework significantly outperforms single-fidelity baselines, providing superior predictions for full nonlinear stress-strain responses as well as stiffness, strength, and energy absorption. This work provides a robust, data-efficient pathway for the inverse design and constitutive modeling of cellular metamaterials."}

However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone."}

To be submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Modern studies in astrophysics and cosmology increasingly rely on simulations and cross-survey analyses, yet differences in data generation, instrumentation, calibration, and unmodeled physics introduce distribution mismatches between datasets (``domain shift''). In machine-learning pipelines, this occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and labels differs between the training (source) and application (target) domains, causing source-trained models to underperform on the target. Transfer learning and domain adaptation provide principled ways to mitigate this effect. We study a concrete simulation-to-observation case: semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) to transfer a four-class spectral classifier -- high-redshift quasars, low-redshift quasars, galaxies, and stars -- from J-PAS mock catalogs based on DESI spectra to real J-PAS observations. Our pipeline pretrains on abundant labeled DESI$\\rightarrow$J-PAS mocks and adapts to the target domain using a small labeled J-PAS subset. We benchmark SSDA against two baselines: a J-PAS--only supervised model trained with the same target-label budget, and a mocks-only model evaluated on held-out J-PAS data. On this held-out J-PAS data, SSDA achieves a macro-F1 score (balancing precision and recall) of $0.82$ and an overall true positive rate of $0.89$, compared to $0.79/0.85$ for the J-PAS--only baseline and $0.73/0.87$ for the mocks-only model. The gains are driven primarily by improved quasar classification, especially in the high-redshift subclass ($\\mathrm{F1}=0.66$ vs.\\ $0.55/0.37$), yielding better-calibrated candidate lists for spectroscopic targeting (e.g., WEAVE-QSO) and AGN searches.

However, these links are more vulnerable to cross-modal coupling that significantly impacts their overall performance. This study presents a technique aimed at minimizing the coupling of energy into higher-order modes within weakly coupled rectangular dielectric waveguides that are excited by a linear taper. The approach involves wrapping the waveguide with a material of a higher dielectric constant than both the core and the cladding of the waveguide. The added material significantly improves the modal confinement factor of the fundamental mode to the core, leading to a much smaller coupling to the parasitic higher-order cladding modes. The new waveguide with the additional material cladding is analyzed, and semi-analytical approximate expressions are derived to predict the mode profiles and cutoffs. Design equations are given to choose the thickness of the wrapping material. The waveguide is fabricated and compared against a similar cross-section waveguide without the additional wrapping material. Unlike the unwrapped waveguide, the group delay (GD) results of the proposed (wrapped) waveguide closely match the EM-simulated GD of the fundamental mode, confirming the significant isolation of higher-order modes. The measured GD of the proposed DWG is 50 ps/m, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 35 ps/m. On the contrary, the unwrapped DWG shows a measured GD of 200 ps/m with significant oscillations, while the expected fundamental mode GD from EM simulations is 25 ps/m, demonstrating that wrapping the waveguide significantly improves the GD by reducing the higher-order mode propagation."}

The trace geometry was modeled using two-dimensional third-order polynomials that reproduce the observed spectral positions with an RMS accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Wavelength calibration, derived from observations of the planetary nebula SMP LMC 58, achieves a precision of 1.6-1.9A for the +1 orders and 0.5A for the +2 orders.

To address this issue, we propose a data-driven nonlinearity correction (NLC) method that models the nonlinear behavior of both the classical response and the defect currents, using dual-illumination measurements and a dark exposure. Applied to H4RG-10 detectors on the PRIME telescope, the method significantly improves signal linearity, especially for pixels with high defect current, while maintaining comparable performance elsewhere. By selecting the optimal correction model per pixel, reliable NLC is achieved across the full array. This study characterizes a nonlinearity intrinsic to H4RG-10 detectors and demonstrates that data-driven post-processing can effectively restore linearity in the presence of large defect currents.

Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods."}

The proposed algebraic extension also proves essential for introducing a workable concept of the efficiency of a polarization calibration scheme, which can then be used to create a merit function for the optimization of calibration sequences, which take into account the specific characteristics of the polarimetric instrument and of its calibration optics."}

The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole."}

We first outline the fundamental framework of MAG, a generalized theory that includes both torsion and non-metricity, and discuss the geometrical significance of torsion within this context. Subsequently, we summarize SVM, a powerful technique that facilitates quantization while effectively incorporating geometrical effects. By integrating these frameworks, we evaluate how the geometrical structures originating from torsion affect quantum fluctuations, demonstrating that they induce non-linearity in quantum mechanics. Notably, torsion, traditionally believed to influence only spin degrees of freedom, can also affect spinless degrees of freedom via quantum fluctuations. Furthermore, extending beyond the results of previous work [Koide and van de Venn, Phys. Rev. A112, 052217 (2025)], we investigate the competitive interplay between the Levi-Civita curvature and torsion within the non-linearity of the Schrödinger equation. Finally, we discuss the structural parallelism between SVM and information geometry, highlighting that the splitting of time derivatives in stochastic processes corresponds to the dual connections in statistical manifolds. These insights pave the way for future extensions to gravity theories involving non-metricity and are expected to deepen our understanding of unresolved cosmological problems."}

We verified the timing accuracy by observing the Crab Pulsar and confirmed stable timing performance within 100 microseconds. To demonstrate pulsar navigation, we applied a method that optimizes orbital parameters to maximize the significance of the pulsar X-ray pulse profile, known as the Significance Enhancement of Pulse-profile with Orbit-dynamics (SEPO) method. We observed the Crab Pulsar with a total exposure of approximately 100 ks at different epochs and analyzed the data transmitted to the ground. By comparing the optimized orbit with the satellite position derived from Global Positioning System data, we quantitatively evaluated the navigation performance. The results show that the position component along the Crab line of sight was consistently constrained within approximately 40 km, and the three-dimensional position error ranged from 27 to 370 km depending on the observation epoch.

By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, φ)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\\Box φ)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation."}

Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $λ_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning.

An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum.

We find that the interaction term $Q(z)$ shows a sign change for all dataset combinations by crossing $Q(z)=0$, depending on the choice of the dataset: at low redshift $Q(z)<0$, indicating vacuum energy decaying into dark matter, while at high redshift $Q(z)>0$, corresponding to dark matter decaying into vacuum energy. The dynamical system analysis found three critical points, namely $P_1,P_2$, and $P_3$ respectively. The resulting critical points, determined by the underlying cosmological parameters, correspond to distinct epochs in cosmic evolution. Depending on the parameter combinations, these points characterize various cosmological phases, ranging from an accelerated stiff matter-dominated era to late-time accelerated expansion. The stability of each critical point is analyzed using linear stability theory, with the relevant physical constraints on the cosmological parameters duly incorporated throughout the analysis. For each dataset combinations, the $Λ(t)$CDM model predicts that $ω_0 > -1$, showing a preference for dynamical dark energy over the cosmological constant scenario with $ω_0 = -1$.

This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent."}

The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors."}

We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks.
