Fast waveform generation frameworks adopt an offline/online\narchitecture, where expensive relativistic computations (e.g. self-force and\nblack hole perturbation theory) are performed offline, and waveforms are\ngenerated rapidly online via interpolation across a multidimensional parameter\nspace. In this work, we investigate potential sources of error that result in\nsystematic bias in these relativistic waveform models, focusing on\nradiation-reaction fluxes. Two key sources of systematics are identified: (i)\nthe intrinsic inaccuracy of the flux data, for which we focus on the truncation\nof the multipolar mode sum, and (ii) interpolation errors from transitioning to\nthe online stage. We quantify the impact of mode-sum truncation and analyze\ninterpolation errors by using various grid structures and interpolation\nschemes. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetime with spins larger than $a \\geq\n0.9$, we find that $\\ell_{\\text{max}} \\geq 30$ is required for the necessary\naccuracy. We also develop an efficient Chebyshev interpolation scheme,\nachieving the desired accuracy level with significantly fewer grid points\ncompared to spline-based methods. For circular orbits in Kerr spacetimes, we\ndemonstrate via Bayesian studies that interpolating the flux to a maximum\nglobal relative error that is equal to the small mass ratio is sufficient for\nparameter estimation purposes. For 4-year long quasi-circular EMRI signals with\nSNRs$= \\mathcal{O}(100)$ and mass-ratios $10^{-4}-10^{-6}$, a global relative\nerror of $10^{-6}$ yields mismatches $<10^{-3}$ and negligible parameter\nestimation biases."}

We introduce a new test method based on Transient\nCurrent Technique (TCT) performed in the interface region of two LGAD devices.\nThe measurement enables extraction of numerous sensor performance parameters,\nsuch as LGAD gain layer depletion voltage, LGAD gain dependence on bias\nvoltage, sensor leakage current and effective interpad distance. Complementary\ncapacitance-voltage measurements and charge collection measurements with 90Sr\non the same samples have been performed to calibrate the TCT results in terms\nof charge collection and define acceptance criteria for wafer radiation\nhardness in the ATLAS-HGTD project."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Astronomical observations at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths heavily\ndepend on the amount of Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) in the atmosphere,\ndirectly affecting the sky transparency and degrading the quality of the\nsignals received by radio telescopes. Predictions of PWV at different\nforecasting horizons is crucial to support telescope operations, engineering\nplanning, and observational scheduling and efficiency of radio observatories\ninstalled in the Chajnantor area in northern Chile. We developed and validated\na Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning-based model to predict PWV at\nforecasting horizons of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours using historical data from two\n183 GHz radiometers and a weather station in the Chajnantor area. We find the\nLSTM method is able to predict PWV in the 12 and 24 hours forecasting horizons\nwith Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 22% compared to 36% of the\ntraditional Global Forecast System (GFS) method used by Atacama Pathfinder\nEXperiment (APEX) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in mm are reduced by\n50%. We present a first application of deep learning techniques for preliminary\npredictions of PWV in the Chajnantor area. The prediction performance shows\nsignificant improvements to traditional methods in 12 and 24 hours time\nwindows. We also propose upgrades to improve our method in short (< 1 hour) and\nlong (> 36 hours) forecasting timescales for future work."}

The stray light was blocked mainly by a custom-designed\nshutter. Toy Monte Carlo simulations were employed to evaluate the measurement\nuncertainty, which was found to be within reasonable limits. These simulations\nfurther indicate that the uncertainty can be reduced and more accurately\npredicted for a larger-scale device with a length of 30 m.

To cope with these high rates in the\npixel trackers, per-pixel time measurements are required, which implies the\nneed for fast sensors. The inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) is one\nof the fast sensor options that is being investigated. This paper will show the\nresults of an inverse Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (iLGAD) with a pitch of 55\n\\textmu m, a thickness of 250~\\textmu m and a large-area (2~cm$^2$), bump\nbonded to a Timepix4 ASIC. Timepix4 has 195~ps time binning on each pixel and\ntherefore an excellent ASIC to test the sensor. The sensor is characterised\nwith radio-active source measurements in the lab, and during beam test at the\nCERN SPS North Area H8 beamline, where the Timepix4 telescope was used. The\ntelescope has a time reference of 12~ps and a pointing resolution of 2.4 $\\pm$\n0.1~\\textmu m. The iLGAD shows an almost uniform gain of approximately 4 and an\nefficiency of 99.6 $\\pm$ 0.1\\%. Without any corrections the obtained time\nresolution is about 750~ps. After timewalk and clock corrections the time\nresolution becomes 377 $\\pm$ 7~ps. Grazing angle measurements have been done,\nwhich allow to measure the time resolution as function of depth of the charge\ndeposition in the sensor. This provides more insight for the perpendicular time\nresolution."}
