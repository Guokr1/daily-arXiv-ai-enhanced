We assume that the scale factor\nfollows a power-law and explore how this model aligns with the expanding\nuniverse. In this perspective, we develop a new agegraphic $f(Q)$ model and\nanalyze the graphical behavior for cosmic evolution. We analyze physical\ncharacteristics of the model using the equation of state parameter,\n$(\\omega_{D}-\\omega^{\\prime}_{D})$ and the $(r-s)$ planes. The equation of\nstate parameter indicates a quintessence era characterized by accelerated\nexpansion. The $(\\omega_{D}-\\omega^{\\prime}_{D})$-plane identifies the freezing\nregion and the Chaplygin gas model is represented in the $(r-s)$-plane.\nFinally, we examine the stability of the non-interacting model by evaluating\nthe squared speed of sound.

A strong demand for characterizing TDs has driven the development of\nmany imaging techniques, such as multiphoton excited photoluminescence (MPPL)\nmicroscopy and spontaneous Raman microscopy. However, all these techniques lack\nthe capability of visualizing densely existing TDs in a non-destructive and\nthree-dimensional (3D) way or distinguishing the types of TDs. Here, we propose\nmultimodal 3D stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and MPPL microscopy to\nnon-destructively characterize the TDs in free-standing GaN substrates.\nLeveraging strong SRS signals, we achieve an imaging speed 10^2-10^3 times\nfaster than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy. This acceleration of the\nimaging speed enables 3D SRS imaging of the strain fields that are induced by\nTDs and correlated with the edge components of the Burgers vectors. Multimodal\n3D SRS and MPPL imaging reveals rich information on TD features and behavior,\nincluding propagation directions, Burgers vectors, dislocation reactions, and\ntheir relationships. Furthermore, we present a deterministic identification\nmethod for screw-type TDs, which are regarded as killer defects causing leakage\ncurrent in p-n junctions, by exploiting no SRS peak shifts at screw\ndislocations in combination with MPPL patterns. Our multimodal imaging\ntechnique will greatly advance the understanding of dislocations toward\nrealizing high-quality GaN crystals and high-performance GaN devices."}
