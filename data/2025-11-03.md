Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between
two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an
extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in
either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through
numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying
electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave
theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when
the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate
complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory,
and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different
problem cases.

Abstract: A huge interesting progress in the field of organic electronic materials and
devices has been observed in the last decade. However, the understanding of
these materials is still a challenge to overcome. Most studies in literature
focus on active devices such as OTFTs, OLEDs and OPVs. Nevertheless, a complete
technology has to have also passive devices in order to allow the design of
interesting applications and complex circuits. This paper deals with the
development of a complete set of passive devices allowing the fabrication of
simple applications such as filters or sensors. The process flow is a fully
screen printed technology that uses exclusively organic materials on gold laser
ablated flexible substrate. Discrete passive (R, L, C) devices have been
processed and characterized. This has permitted the fabrication of RLC low-band
pass filters that are dedicated to RF applications, typically around 1GHz.
Furthermore, based on these discrete passive components, we have developed a
sensitive sensor on flexible substrate for RFID applications. We present the
state of the art of our process development for RF applications using organic
materials.

### [3] [Revisiting the Theory of Photocurrent in Solar Cells](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27577)
*T. Matsuura,S. Saijo*

Main category: physics.app-ph

TL;DR: 重新审视p-n结光伏效应的经典理论，提出了改进的光电流解析表达式，揭示了包含传统光电流和反向光电流两个分量，并通过实验验证了内建电势对光电流行为的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统p-n结光伏效应理论未充分考虑内建电势的定量影响，需要改进理论模型以更准确描述光电流行为。

Method: 应用更精确的边界条件，推导改进的光电流解析表达式，并使用商用硅太阳能电池进行实验验证。

Result: 发现光电流包含传统光电流和反向光电流两个分量，反向光电流会降低总光电流，内建电势的作用是抑制反向电流。改进表达式预测在特定正向偏压下光电流会消失，实验验证了这一预测。

Conclusion: 内建电势对光电流行为有直接影响，改进的理论模型能更准确地描述p-n结的光伏效应特性。

Abstract: The built-in potential of p-n junctions plays a critical role in charge
separation, which is fundamental to the photovoltaic effect. However, the
conventional classical theory of photovoltaic effect in p-n junctions typically
does not account for the quantitative influence of the built-in potential. In
this study, we revisit the classical theory and propose an improved analytic
expression of photocurrent by applying more accurate boundary conditions. Our
improved expression reveals that the photocurrent comprises of two components:
the conventional photocurrent and a previously unrecognized backward
photocurrent. Latter reduces the total photocurrent, yet it has not been
discussed in prior literature. The essential role of the built-in potential is
to suppress this backward current. Furthermore, our improved expression of
photocurrent predicts that the photocurrent vanishes under certain forward bias
conditions. This prediction is experimentally validated using a commercial
silicon solar cell, confirming the direct impact of the built-in potential on
photocurrent behavior.

### [4] [jFoF: GPU Cluster Finding with Gradient Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26851)
*Benjamin Horowitz,Adrian E. Bayer*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: jFoF是一个完全基于GPU的Friends-of-Friends（FoF）晕族查找器，使用JAX实现，提供端到端加速和可微分建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FoF算法存在CPU-GPU数据传输瓶颈，且缺乏可微分性，限制了在可微分推断和端到端优化中的应用。

Method: 在JAX中实现完全GPU原生的FoF算法，引入两种邻域搜索策略（k-d树和链接单元网格），支持冻结分配和拓扑优化两种可微分模式。

Result: 相比优化的CPU实现，jFoF实现了高达一个数量级的速度提升，同时保持一致的晕族目录，并支持通过REINFORCE风格估计器进行梯度传播。

Conclusion: jFoF为可微分推断提供了基础，使结构形成模型能够在GPU加速的天体物理管道中进行端到端的基于梯度的优化。

Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder
designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable
modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by
performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction
directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two
complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel
linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude
speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent
halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through
discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological
optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a
REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo
connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with
discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for
differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of
structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We
make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.

### [5] [IrisML: Neural Posterior Estimation for the Spectral Energy Distribution fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26964)
*Mateusz Kapusta*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 提出一种新的机器学习模型，用于从测光数据中自动进行稳健推断，作为传统贝叶斯方法的可扩展高效替代方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯方法如MCMC采样计算密集且需要人工调参或专家监督，无法满足大规模测光天文调查的需求

Method: 设计了一种新颖的机器学习模型，能够从测光数据中自动执行稳健的参数推断

Result: 该方法提供了一个可扩展且高效的替代方案，能够处理SDSS、Pan-STARRS、Gaia等大规模测光调查数据

Conclusion: 机器学习模型为天文测光数据推断提供了比传统贝叶斯方法更高效、自动化的解决方案

Abstract: Over the past 30 years, numerous large-scale photometric astronomical surveys
have been conducted, including SDSS, Pan-STARRS, Gaia,2MASS, WISE, and others.
These surveys provide extensive photometric measurements that can be used to
infer a wide range of physical parameters of astronomical objects.
Traditionally, Bayesian approaches, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling have been employed for such inference tasks. However, these methods
tend to be computationally intensive and often require manual tuning or expert
supervision. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning model designed
to perform automatic and robust inference from photometric data, offering a
scalable and efficient alternative to conventional techniques.

### [6] [Photometric Redshifts in JWST Deep Fields: A Pixel-Based Alternative with DeepDISC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27032)
*Grant Merz,Ming-Yang Zhuang,Junyao Li,Qian Yang,Yue Shen,Xin Liu,John Franklin Crenshaw*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 本文评估了DeepDISC图像深度学习算法在JWST近红外数据上的光度红移估计性能，发现其表现与模板拟合法相当甚至更优，且处理速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基于图像的机器学习算法在高红移近红外数据上的光度红移估计效果，因为传统方法主要针对低红移光学巡天，而图像算法在此领域的应用尚不充分。

Method: 使用DeepDISC深度学习框架，直接从NIRCam图像中检测、分离源并生成概率性光度红移估计，与模板拟合法进行对比。

Result: DeepDISC产生的光度红移和不确定性可靠，与HST+JWST滤波器的模板拟合结果相当；在匹配输入滤波器时甚至表现更优（更低的离散度和更少的异常值）。处理94000个源仅需约4分钟。

Conclusion: 尽管当前光谱训练样本较小且不完整，但DeepDISC展示了在更大图像体积和光谱样本中的潜力，为未来巡天项目提供了有前景的光度红移估计方法。

Abstract: Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are
widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a
unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been
developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine
learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those
that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the
efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains
underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance
Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric
redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep
Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce
probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after
detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a
compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces
reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template
fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting
(lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched.
Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry
from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a
single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small
and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential
of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples
from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on
applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES
DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating
caveats.

Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive
maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By
leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale
experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine
learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution
for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.

### [8] [Moonlit sky polarization patterns from Cerro Paranal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27308)
*B. Pereira,S. Gonzalez-Gaitan,A. M. Mourao,J. Rino-Silvestre,A. Paulino-Afonso,J. P. Anderson,A. Cikota,A. Morales-Garoffolo*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 研究月光天空的偏振模式，通过观测和模型分析发现月光背景对天文偏振观测的污染，最佳模型是瑞利散射、米散射和非偏振多重散射的组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 月光天空背景在天文观测中可能很显著，是偏振研究的污染源，需要研究其偏振特性以提高天文目标偏振观测的准确性。

Method: 使用FORS2在成像偏振模式下观测满月时的天空，测量不同波长和散射角下的偏振度和强度，并与理论和现象学单次及多次散射模型进行比较。

Result: 单次瑞利散射模型能再现偏振的波长依赖性，但需要引入随波长增加的强退偏振因子；强度数据则需要包含较大气溶胶粒子的米散射；最佳模型是瑞利散射、米散射和非偏振多重散射的组合。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了考虑月光散射对提高天文目标偏振观测精度的重要性，米散射和多重散射在较长波长下更为主导。

Abstract: We investigate the polarization patterns from the moonlit sky as observed
from the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal. The moonlit sky
background can be significant in astronomical observations and thus be a source
of contamination in polarimetric studies. Based on sky observations during full
Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization
degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the
Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple
scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the
wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization
factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however,
require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles.
The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a
combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an
unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering
become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud
depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also
investigated. The present study underscores the importance of accounting for
moonlight scattering to enhance the accuracy of polarimetric observations of
astronomical targets.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: 基于函数连接理论(TFC)构建庞加莱映射的新方法，通过约束泛函获得连续可微的系统轨迹表示，无需数值积分即可精确计算截面交点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖数值积分和插值检测轨迹与截面的交点，存在精度不足和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 将庞加莱映射计算构建为初值问题或边值问题，利用TFC约束泛函嵌入初始条件或周期性条件，实现线性收敛到泰勒级数。

Result: 该方法在机器精度水平上实现准确计算，计算量适中，无需变量变换或自适应步长的迭代积分方案。

Conclusion: TFC为构建庞加莱映射、计算周期轨道和分析复杂动力系统提供了强大高效的替代框架，特别适用于天体动力学领域。

Abstract: Poincar\'e maps play a fundamental role in nonlinear dynamics and chaos
theory, offering a means to reduce the dimensionality of continuous dynamical
systems by tracking the intersections of trajectories with lower-dimensional
section surfaces. Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical
integration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to
inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel
methodology for constructing Poincar\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional
Connections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous
and differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy
prescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\'e maps is formulated as
either an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For
IVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection
time with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear
convergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation
without resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs,
periodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body
Problem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to
construct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to
non-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body
Problem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest
computational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or
iterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate
that TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing
Poincar\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical
systems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts.

TL;DR: 为CROSS实验开发了专用的μ子否决系统，用于抑制地下实验室中残余宇宙μ子通量对无中微子双β衰变搜索的背景干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CROSS实验场地的残余宇宙μ子通量较高（约20 μ/m²/h），在感兴趣区域（约3 MeV）构成主要背景，需要μ子否决系统来降低背景水平。

Method: 在CROSS低背景装置周围安装μ子否决系统，形成四个侧面、一个顶部和四个底部扇区，通过两种μ子触发逻辑（基于2个扇区或单个扇区的符合）与热探测器的多重性切割相结合。

Result: 系统运行稳定，触发率与蒙特卡洛模拟一致。两种触发逻辑分别能排除ROI中99.2%和99.7%的μ子诱发事件，将μ子诱发背景降低至约2×10⁻³ cnts/keV/kg/yr的可接受水平。

Conclusion: 开发的μ子否决系统有效降低了CROSS实验中的μ子诱发背景，为高灵敏度无中微子双β衰变搜索提供了保障。

Abstract: In preparation to the CROSS experiment at the Canfranc underground laboratory
(Spain) $-$ aiming to search for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
decay of $^{100}$Mo using low-temperature detectors with heat-scintillation
readout $-$ we report on development of a dedicated muon veto system. The need
for the muon veto in CROSS is caused by a comparatively high residual cosmic
muon flux at the experimental site ($\sim$20 $\mu$/m$^2$/h), being a dominant
background in the region of interest (ROI) at $\sim$3 MeV. Thus, we installed
the muon veto system around the CROSS low-background setup, forming four
lateral, one top, and four bottom sectors. In this paper we describe the
design, construction and operation of the CROSS muon veto system, as well as
its optimization and validation by comparing dedicated Monte Carlo (MC)
simulations of muons with low-temperature measurements in the setup. We
demonstrate a stable operation of the veto system with the average trigger
rates compatible with MC simulations. Also, we investigated two muon trigger
logics based on coincidences with either 2 sectors or a single sector of the
veto. The MC study shows that, in combination with the multiplicity cut of
thermal detectors, these trigger logics allow to reject 99.2\% and 99.7\% of
muon-induced events in the ROI, respectively. Despite a comparatively high dead
time ($\sim$18\%) introduced by coincidences with any of nine sectors of the
veto $-$ the adopted strategy $-$ the muon-induced background in the ROI of the
CROSS experiment can be reduced down to $\sim$2 $\times 10^{-3}$
cnts/keV/kg/yr, i.e., an acceptable level compatible with a high-sensitivity
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decay search foreseen in CROSS.

TL;DR: ALICE实验的新内径迹系统ITS2在2021年LHC Run 3开始运行，采用硅单片有源像素传感器技术，具有高空间分辨率和低材料预算，需要校准24,120个传感器和126亿像素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ITS2作为LHC中首次应用MAPS技术的大规模探测器，其稳定数据采集需要对大量像素进行校准，包括像素电荷阈值和噪声像素屏蔽等参数。

Method: 开发了ITS2校准方法，包括监测和动态调整探测器关键性能参数的策略。

Result: ITS2相比前代系统在指向分辨率、低横向动量下的跟踪效率以及读出速率能力方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 论文提出了ITS2校准的方法和策略，这对于确保探测器稳定运行和高质量数据采集至关重要。

Abstract: The new Inner Tracking System (ITS2) of the ALICE experiment began operation
in 2021 with the start of LHC Run 3. Compared to its predecessor, ITS2 offers
substantial improvements in pointing resolution, tracking efficiency at low
transverse momenta, and readout-rate capabilities. The detector employs silicon
Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) featuring a pixel size of
26.88$\times$29.24 $\mu$m$^2$ and an intrinsic spatial resolution of
approximately 5 $\mu$m. With a remarkably low material budget of 0.36% of
radiation length ($X_{0}$) per layer in the three innermost layers and a total
sensitive area of about 10 m$^2$, the ITS2 constitutes the largest-scale
application of MAPS technology in a high-energy physics experiment and the
first of its kind operated at the LHC. For stable data taking, it is crucial to
calibrate different parameters of the detector, such as in-pixel charge
thresholds and the masking of noisy pixels. The calibration of 24120 monolithic
sensors, comprising a total of 12.6$\times$10$^{9}$ pixels, represents a major
operational challenge. This paper presents the methods developed for the
calibration of the ITS2 and outlines the strategies for monitoring and
dynamically adjusting the detector's key performance parameters over time.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于钇铁石榴石(YIG)球体与铜谐振腔磁子-光子混合的宽频带磁强计，可在VHF频段(150-225 MHz)实现亚pT级磁场测量，具有高动态范围和尺寸无关的灵敏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要开发能够在甚高频(VHF)范围内测量局部化和方向性交变磁场的灵敏仪器，特别是实现亚pT级别的磁场检测能力。

Method: 利用YIG球体与铜谐振腔之间的磁子-光子混合效应，采用谐振外差检测方案，通过偏置磁场调节YIG拉莫尔频率并调整磁子-光子耦合强度来拓宽测量带宽。

Result: 在150-225 MHz频段实现了亚pT级的最小灵敏度，动态范围超过100 dB，室温下工作，预计在低温环境下可达fT级别。灵敏度与尺寸无关，适合芯片级集成。

Conclusion: 该设备可作为量子电路的重要构建模块，如巴伦、换能器或信号处理单元，具有重要的应用前景。

Abstract: We present here an optimisation and demonstration of a wide band instrument
capable of measuring localised and directionally alternated magnetic fields
below pT in the very high frequency (VHF) range. We take advantage of the
magnon-photon hybridization between a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere and a
copper resonant cavity to employ a resonant heterodyne detection scheme. The
measurement is near instantaneous due to the strong coupling attained between
magnons and photons.In this work measurements are reported showing a
significant widening of the measurement bandwidth, obtained by tuning the YIG
Larmor frequency with a bias magnetic field and adjusting the magnon-photon
coupling strength. Minimum sensitivity in the sub pT regime is demonstrated in
the range 150 -- 225 MHz at room temperature and expected to go to fT in
cryogenic temperatures. Dynamic range is estimated to be above 100 dB. The
sensitivity is found to be independent on size, being ready to in-chip
miniaturization. Such device can be an important building block to quantum
circuits, such as baluns, transducers or signal processing units.

Main category: physics.space-ph

TL;DR: 本研究分析了2023年南极地区电离层对强烈空间天气事件的响应，发现等离子体对流比极光沉降更能显著增强电离层总电子含量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索南极地区电离层对强烈空间天气事件的响应机制，特别是与等离子体对流和极光沉降的相关性，因为南极是研究较少的极区。

Method: 使用2023年6次地磁暴主相期间南极地区GPS接收器的TEC数据，结合极光沉降图和SuperDARN等离子体对流图进行分析。

Result: TEC增强与极光沉降的相关性为R~0.31，与等离子体对流的相关性为R~0.88，表明等离子体对流对TEC增强的贡献更大。

Conclusion: 在南极地区，等离子体对流是导致电离层密度显著增强的主要因素，而非极光沉降。

Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric
responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma
convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms
occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are
considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC)
measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used
for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral
precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations
relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the
effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the
enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and
the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more
responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values
of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this
work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric
density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong
levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.

Motivation: 通过分析引力波背景信号来约束早期宇宙的各种物理过程，包括相变、宇宙弦、畴壁等，这些过程可能产生可观测的引力波背景。

Method: 结合Advanced LIGO O4a数据集与早期O1、O2、O3运行数据，搜索引力波背景信号，并考虑天体物理背景的影响。

Result: 未检测到显著的引力波背景信号，但对多种早期宇宙过程的参数设定了严格的能量密度上限约束。

Conclusion: LIGO-Virgo数据已经能够对众多早期宇宙场景提供显著约束，为宇宙学和高能物理模型提供了重要限制。

Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early
Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data
from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable
signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive
gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data
to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early
Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff
equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations,
primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the
presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and
neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered.
We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics
models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo
data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe
scenarios.

Abstract: We investigate the conformal regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in
four-dimensional Riemann-Cartan geometry, employing a consistent dimensional

as an intrinsic source for a long-range torsion field, providing a purely
four-dimensional mechanism to sustain torsion as a hair on black holes, without
reliance on extra dimensions.

Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such
as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify
the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases
in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space
distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak
adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard
adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via
internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic
initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although
the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the
importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define
the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of
gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across
surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error
correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge
invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space.
The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates
an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann
algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole
entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of
the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the
black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The
algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the
entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.

Abstract: High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in
interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light
noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on
surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these
measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this
article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on
surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein
Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles
deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred
times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence
on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize
to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed
density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness
guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required
cleanliness class of the installation environment.

Abstract: The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement
entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate
the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators
within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann
algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This
algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin
networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by
the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area
law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we
show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and
produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to
LQG black hole entropy.

Abstract: This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian
covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a
spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral
that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a
geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling
surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient
$\beta>0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the
coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
$\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 < \gamma
\lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to
gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.

Conclusion: 通过重整化可获得与2-复形体结构无关的有限结果，为spinfoam形式体系中存在量子引力非平凡不动点提供了可能性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in
spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam
stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of
2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of
faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing
the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area
of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an
integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold.
This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the
underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics
from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF
theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a
powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a
triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends
only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result
that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This
provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined
limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of
quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.

Conclusion: 反德西特时空中均匀恒星的引力扰动具有独特的驻波特性和回声现象，这与传统时空中引力波的传播行为有显著差异。

Abstract: The article studies the dynamical behavior of axial gravitational
perturbations of homogeneous stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Because the
radial coordinate $r$ transforms into the tortoise coordinate $y = y(r)$,
obeying $y(r=0)=0$ and $y(r\rightarrow\infty)=y_\text{max}<\infty$, the
tortoise coordinates domain is finite, and the gravitational waves fail to
reach out of the domain. Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates,
the perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime
is analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics.
Therefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing
wave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to
show the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples.
On the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces
back and forth within this potential well. Furthermore, due to the shape of the
gravitational potential function $V$ within the range $0\le y\le y_\text{max}$,
an echo phenomenon occurs at the surface of the star. As the energy of the wave
packet remains within the potential well, each time it traverses the surface of
the star, a reflective echo is generated. Consequently, after multiple
reflections, the Gaussian wave packet cannot maintain its original shape and
ultimately disperses.

than that of non-magnetized one for the same equation of state and central

strong enough B~10^17-10^18G. Using our recently developed numerical code
COCAL, we systematically compute such compact star solutions in equilibrium
associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, and show the
magnetically supramassive solutions whose masses exceed by more than 10% of the
maximum mass of the static and spherically symmetric solutions. For some
extremely strong magnetic field configurations, we also obtain solutions more
massive than the maximum mass of the uniformly rotating solutions at the Kepler

Method: 采用双曲框架处理标量扰动，将准正规模谱问题转化为二维特征值问题，使用二维伪谱法计算谱线，并利用pyRing构建参数估计流程分析引力波数据。

Result: 即使旋转量子修正黑洞谱与Kerr谱只有微小偏差，量子引力理论中的额外参数与黑洞本征参数的强相关性也会显著影响质量和自旋参数的后验分布。

Abstract: The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a rotating quantum corrected black hole
(RQCBH) are studied by employing the hyperboloidal framework for the scalar
perturbation. This framework is used to cast the QNMs spectra problem into the
two-dimensional eigenvalues problem, then the spectra are calculated by
imposing two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method. Based on the resulting
spectra, a parameter estimation pipeline for this RQCBH model with
gravitational wave data is constructed by using \texttt{pyRing} in the ringdown
phase. We find that, even when the RQCBH spectra exhibits a small deviation
from the Kerr spectra, the strong correlation between the extra parameter
coming from the quantum gravity theory and the intrinsic parameter of black
hole may significantly affect the posterior distributions of the mass $M$ and
the dimensionless spin $\bar{a}$.

Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark
energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications
in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this
approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving
dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be
simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in
second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we
derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP
model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we
also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to
$f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as
superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect
the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction
(DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the
emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and
their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be
extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and,
therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the
dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing
ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the
properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the
stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant
DM parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有两个视界的黑洞蒸发热力学，探索其与Schwarzschild黑洞不同的热力学行为，特别是温度动态与相变、零能条件违反之间的关系。

Method: 分析Kiselev黑洞在质量M和各向异性流体参数N变化下的霍金温度动态，研究温度行为与相变、零能条件违反的关联。

Result: 发现黑洞蒸发时温度不会发散而趋于零；某些参数下出现温度峰值和热容发散的相变；相变特性由零能条件违反决定：全局违反导致视界合并和温度抑制，部分或没有违反则恢复标准蒸发图像。

Conclusion: 在各向异性黑洞时空中，热力学稳定性、视界动态和能量条件结构之间存在直接对应关系，零能条件违反决定了黑洞蒸发的热力学行为。

Abstract: The evaporation of black holes with two horizons presents a rich
thermodynamic landscape that departs fundamentally from the Schwarzschild
paradigm. In this work, we analyze the Hawking temperature dynamics of the
Kiselev black hole under varying mass $M$ and anisotropic fluid parameter $N$,
explicitly connecting temperature behavior to phase transitions and violations
of the null energy condition (NEC). We find that the temperature does not
necessarily diverge during evaporation; instead, it typically falls to zero as
the black hole evaporates. This cooling behavior is preceded, in certain
parameter regimes, by a phase transition marked by a peak in temperature and a
divergence in heat capacity. Crucially, the presence and nature of these phase
transitions are dictated by the spacetime regions where the NEC is violated:
global NEC violation leads to horizon merger and temperature suppression, while
partial or absent violation can restore the standard evaporation picture. Our
results establish a direct correspondence between thermodynamic stability,
horizon dynamics, and energy condition structure in anisotropic black hole
spacetimes.

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient,
high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current
analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian
expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains
computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact
renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We
demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of
the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for
non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our
method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for
complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic
nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new
tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.
