Advantageously, the nanowire\ndiameter can be tailored by the initial metal film thickness. However, we show\nhere that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire\ndiameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies\nthat are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and\ninterface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the\nnanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx\nsubstrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals\nto tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect\nthe relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited\nrange. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional\ntop-down nanowire fabrication process.

Furthermore, EUV photons with\nsufficiently high energy exhibit penetration depths of um-level in dehydrated\nbiomatter, enabling exceptional amplitude and phase contrast through thin\ncellular regions and small cells. These findings provide quantitative\nguidelines for photon energy selection and establish the EUV protein window as\na dose-efficient and physically viable modality for high-resolution,\nlabel-free, material-specific imaging of dehydrated biological matter."}

Over the past\nfew decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable\nattention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$\nframework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members\nof the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to\ngeneral relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential\nastrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation\non the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and\ngravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry\nfollowed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate\nvalue, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all\nmembers) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om (RN) BH. In its turn,\nfor a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe\ndiscrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those\nof the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius\nA$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the\ncharge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs."}

In this paper we\napplied the sEGB reconstruction procedure from our previous work\n\\cite{Er_Ivash} to the Y{\\i}lmaz-Rosen metric, a solution potentially\ndescribing a quasi-black hole without an event horizon. Within this framework,\nwe also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal\ncoupling.\n  Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes\nand the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein\nequations in the Y{\\i}lmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are\nviolated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of\nexotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of\n$T_u^u$. This could originate from a scalar field (such as the Higgs field or\nanother nonlinear field), or from phenomena like dark energy or quintessence.\n  In addition, we considered the application of our reconstruction method in\nthe sEGB model in the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) metric. As noted in this\npaper, the Y{\\i}lmaz-Rosen metric is a limiting case of the Janus metric (as $s\n\\to +\\infty$).
