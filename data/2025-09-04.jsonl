We start by\nexplaining the main motivation behind such an idea, and we determine the main\ndifferences between this scenario and the classical black hole (hereafter\nreferred to as the $CBH$) scenario. Particularly important are the facts that,\nin the $HSBH$ scenario, (i) test particles in the region inside the horizon\nexperience a repulsive force that prevents them from reaching the center, (ii)\ntest particles may cross the horizon outward only along the symmetry axis, and\n(iii) the spacetime within the horizon is static but not spherically symmetric.\nNext, we examine the differences between the two models of black holes in light\nof the Landauer principle and the Hawking results on the eventual evaporation\nof the black hole and the paradox resulting thereof. Finally, we explore what\nobservational signature could be invoked to confirm or dismiss the model."}

The resulting shape functions are\nshown to satisfy all the fundamental requirements for traversable wormhole\ngeometries. Our analysis reveals that the presence of exotic matter is\nunavoidable in sustaining these wormholes, and we quantify its total amount\nthrough the volume integral quantifier.

To enhance the physical relevance of the\npresent work, we study several key features of the wormholes, including the\nembedding surface, proper radial distance, tidal forces, and total\ngravitational energy.

This work is related to the black hole\ninterior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically\nsymmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior\nvolume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a\nspace-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$.\nUsing this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is\nproportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this\nformulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of\ninfalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of\nHawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the\ncharged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical\nanalysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the\nvolume linearly increases with advancing time.\n  Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the\nentropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black\nhole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black\nhole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality\nconstant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy\nis less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note\nthat these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than\nthe Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand\nthe uncertainty relation."}

However, outflows\ncan also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths.\nTherefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is\nworthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic\nwind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code\nSIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric,\nsingle- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these\nlines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with\nobservations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for\nidentifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile\nshape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our\n`Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this\ndiagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of\nthe line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the\nfull-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic\ndiagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the\nstrengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters.\nThis relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of --\noutflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are\nopen-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set\nof H-alpha spectral profiles."}
