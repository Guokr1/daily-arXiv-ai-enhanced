This contribution presents a long short-term memory autoencoder-based algorithm for detecting anomalies in ATLAS Liquid Argon calorimeter data, represented as multidimensional time series of statistical moments of energy cluster properties. Trained on good-quality data, the model identifies anomalous intervals. Validation is performed using a known short-term issue of noise bursts, and the potential for broader application to transient calorimeter issues is discussed."}

The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba."}

However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\\rmΩ$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded."}

The spacetime around a rotating braneworld black hole is modelled by a Kerr-Newman-like metric determined by its mass $M$, spin $a$, and tidal charge $q$, which encodes the gravitational effects of the bulk spacetime. We consider both inhomogeneous and homogeneous plasma environments characterized by plasma parameters $α_i$ ($i=1,2\\text{ and }3$) to study light propagation and the interplay of the background spacetime and the plasma environment in influencing the shadow size and shape. We find that as the plasma density increases, inhomogeneous plasma environments decrease the shadow size, however homogeneous plasma enlarges it. On studying the effect due to background spacetime we find that $q<0$ (negative tidal charge) increases the shadow diameter, while $q>0$ decreases it. Using the EHT measurements of M87* and Sgr A*, we constrain the $(q,α_i)$ parameter space. The EHT data constrains the tidal charge in the range $-1.15 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.45$ for M87* and $-0.65 \\lesssim q \\lesssim 0.8$ for Sgr A* in the low density plasma limit. As the plasma density increases, the data exhibits a preference towards negative tidal charge for inhomogeneous plasma environments and positive tidal charge for homogeneous plasma environments. Our study reveals that the size of the shadow is primarily governed by the background geometry in presence of low density plasma environments such as that observed in M87* and Sgr A*. However, if supermassive blackholes are surrounded by high density plasma then the shadow size is dictated by both the background metric and the plasma environment."}

In GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), hot longitudinal optical (LO) phonons can act as an intrinsic performance bottleneck by reducing electron saturation velocity, output current, and transconductance, which are key device metrics. While bulk GaN studies report LO phonon lifetimes of approximately 1 ps, leading to strong nonequilibrium phonon populations, ungated heterostructures show much shorter lifetimes of only tens of femtoseconds. Because direct measurement inside a HEMT channel is challenging, the true impact of hot phonons remains uncertain. Using full-band transport simulations of a fabricated GaN HEMT, we show that LO phonon lifetimes must be less than about 40 fs to reproduce measured I-V characteristics, consistent with ultrafast decay observed in GaN heterostructures. We further demonstrate that even these ultrafast lifetimes are not sufficient to eliminate hot phonon effects: the residual nonequilibrium LO population continues to limit the current density at high bias. Moreover, when the LO phonon lifetime exceeds a few tens of femtoseconds, a pronounced hot phonon bottleneck emerges, leading to substantial current-density suppression that is inconsistent with experiment."}

The challenge of scattering and coupling suppression is holistically addressed across the wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is developed to mitigate high-frequency scattering and coupling while maintaining low-frequency radiation performance. Compared with a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral achieves a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, the segmented-spiral dipole achieves impedance matching in the low band (LB, 3.05-4.68 GHz, 42.2%), covering the 5G band (3.3-4.2 GHz), while additional suppressors further reduce cross-band coupling. The middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate at 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G bands (6.425-15.35 GHz). Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure to avoid common-mode resonances within the LB and MB and to minimize cross-band scattering in the HB.

These systems share several key features with black holes in General Relativity, such as the presence of an effective acoustic horizon and a wave equation describing linear excitations.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion."}

However, the output power of a single magnetron is limited by its resonant cavities, posing a physical constraint. High-efficiency coherent power combining based on the injection-locking technique effectively overcomes this limitation and meets the demand for higher output power. Nevertheless, using isolators, such as circulators, introduces significant insertion loss, and the injection signal sources and phase shifters increase the system size, cost, and complexity in a conventional magnetron power combining (MPC) system. A novel method is proposed to utilize the coupling between two ports of an H-plane tee to achieve peer-to-peer injection locking magnetrons. Meanwhile, an asymmetric phase compensation is realized using a section of waveguide to adjust the magnetron output characteristics. Theoretical and numerical analyses provided qualitative insight into the system output behavior. Subsequently, an experimental system was developed for verification. In the experiments, the system achieved maximum microwave power combining efficiencies 90.2%, 93.6%, and 93.6% at electrical waveguide lengths corresponding to 90, 135, and 225, with output powers of 1650, 1260, and 1610 W, respectively, without the use of any isolators or external injection sources. The experimental results show good agreement with numerical calculations. This method offers the advantages of low cost, compact size, and low loss, providing a new approach for developing high-performance MPC systems in the future."}

Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring."}

The discussion is then extended to dynamical black holes, where evolving horizons require modified treatments incorporating trapping horizons, Kodama vectors, and dynamical surface gravity. We explored the possible tunneling paths for particles crossing the horizon in dynamical black holes and emphasized the crucial role of the imaginary part of the action in determining the Hawking temperature. In the second part, we review experimental investigations of Hawking radiation, including analogue black hole experiments, quantum simulations, and astrophysical searches for primordial black hole evaporation.

Within the PandaX-III experiment, which aims to investigate neutrinoless double beta decay, Micromegas detectors serve as charge readout devices. High energy resolution is a critical requirement for the readout plane in this context, and gain uniformity significantly impacts the achievable resolution, primarily because of the extended tracks of primary ionization electrons. However, scaling up MPGDs to larger active areas exacerbates the challenge of maintaining gain uniformity, and effectively controlling the uniformity of the avalanche gap is a key factor in the detector manufacturing process via the thermal bonding method. This study demonstrates that optimizing the thermal bonding films specifically at the detector edges can effectively improve the gain uniformity, achieving a gain uniformity of < 5% over the entire 200*200 mm2 active area in a 1 bar Ar/isobutane (96.5/3.5) gas mixture. Additionally, the gain uniformity of approximately 14% was characterized at high pressures of up to 10 bar, revealing promising potential for high resolution measurements in the PandaX-III experiment and other high-pressure applications."}

However, when the magnetic-array-type current sensors are applied to multi-conductor systems such as multi-core cables, the time-varying correlations among conductor currents may degrade the performance of multi-latent-variable data-driven models for error evaluation. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust self-error correcting method for magnetic-array-type current sensors even under significant variations in phase current correlations (e.g., large fluctuations in three-phase current imbalance). By incorporating phase current decoupling and principal component analysis (PCA), the correlation analysis of multi-latent variables (i.e., multi-conductor currents) is transformed into a single-latent-variable (corresponding to single phase current) modeling problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively detects error drifts of magnetic field sensors as low as $2\\times10^{-3}$ in relative error and $2\\times10^{-3}$ rad in phase error. Accurate evaluation and correction of each magnetic field sensor's error drifts substantially eliminates the overall error drift in the magnetic-array-type current sensor, validating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed self-error correcting method."}

A Case Study in North Spain", "comment": "19 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Potable water utilities are currently making great efforts to reduce leakage rates and assure long-term supply to the population due to the challenges of climate change, growing population and water shortage scenarios that have been on them over the last years. One of the most employed methods to reduce leakage includes the installation of pressurereducing valves along the water distribution network and the utilization of pressure management schemes. Pressure management includes different types of control models, which are applied according to the requirements of each site. The most advanced and sophisticated scheme is critical point control, which relies on a flow signal from a measuring device or online communication between the critical point and the valve. This paper proposes the utilization of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, or the SARIMA model, to correlate pressure at the outlet of the valve and pressure on the critical point of the area supplied, aiming to set a fixed pressure in the critical point. The SARIMA model is developed according to historical data logged in the field and then validated. Later, the SARIMA model was tested on a real location in the village of Noja, Spain. The analysis of the field test results prove that the proposed model is feasible to be used since there is no significance difference between the target values set in the critical point and the real values measured in the field. The research proves that the SARIMA model can be used as an alternative for critical point control in water distribution networks when no flow signal is available or when communication between the critical point and the pressure reducing valve is not an option."}

The computations are performed at the second-and-a-half relative post-Newtonian order. We first derive the quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the conservative motion; we then express the radial separation and phase with their time derivatives in terms of the orbital frequency, the time eccentricity and the eccentric anomaly.

Because the field equations are highly nonlinear, no closed analytical solution for the scale factor in terms of cosmic time exists. To address this limitation and determine the flip time along with other physical characteristics, we introduce an alternative first order approximation that yields an exact analytical expression for the scale factor. This approach gives rise to an emergent, non singular cosmological scenario in which the universe begins with a finite minimum size and evolves smoothly from a quasi static phase to a de Sitter like expansion at late times, naturally approaching the LambdaCDM limit. Using Hubble observational data, we constrain the equation of state parameters and obtain the viable ranges 0 < alpha < 1 and 0 < A < 1/3. The effective equation of state parameter evolves from a positive value in the early matter dominated era to approximately minus one at late times, consistent with observations. A complementary analysis based on the Raychaudhuri equation further supports the robustness of the model."}

The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands."}

By working with the elementary analytic extension (the union of the interior and exterior regions glued across the disk), we show that excising the ring singularity yields a domain that can be realised as a branched double cover of an exterior Kerr region. The branch locus is the ring itself, and the associated deck transformation defines a non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-action that exchanges the two sheets ($r>0$ and $r<0$) of the spacetime.\n  We give a covering-space characterisation of this double-sheeted structure and show that admissible geodesics which cross the ring singularity implement the non-trivial deck transformation. In particular, we prove a parity-of-crossings property: any admissible geodesic that traverses an even number of ring singularities returns to its original sheet, while an odd number of traversals terminates on the opposite sheet.\n  Generalising to $N$ disjoint ring singularities, we prove that the fundamental group of the excised manifold is the free group $F_N$ generated by simple loops around each ring, and we classify the associated double covers. Identifying the physically distinguished cover where every ring induces a sheet exchange, we extend the parity-of-crossings theorem to the multi-ring setting. We then formally extend these results to the maximal analytic extension (the infinite Carter--Penrose chain), proving that the sheet-exchange mechanism applies globally to this infinite structure.\n  Finally, applying the Novikov self-consistency principle to this topological framework, we demonstrate that the requirement of global consistency restricts admissible histories to discrete sectors labelled by ring-crossing parities."}

To improve rectification efficiency, Schottky diodes, which are sensitive to low power, are commonly selected as rectifying devices to convert microwave power into dc power. However, low-power rectifying diodes typically have low reverse breakdown voltages, making them susceptible to reverse breakdown under high power conditions. This letter proposes a low-power rectifier with reconfigurable function. The rectifying diode is connected in parallel with the p-i-n diode. At low input power, the output dc voltage is low, and the p-i-n diode remains off, having no impact on the rectifier operation. As the input power increases, the p-i-n diode turns on, causing change in circuit structure and impedance mismatch. This leads to increased reflected power, thereby preventing the rectifying diode from receiving excessive power. In addition, the turn-on voltage of the p-i-n diode is lower than the reverse breakdown voltage of the rectifying diode, protecting it from reverse breakdown."}

We show that the evolution of the particle number in the cloud, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the scalar field, can be consistently explained within the standard framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we prove that the growth of the cloud occurs independently of the choice of initial state. We also explore several phenomena related to a massive scalar field in a rotating black hole spacetime, including Hawking radiation, adiabatic backreaction on the black hole spin, and the direction of level transitions in the presence of self-interactions of the field.

This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC.

The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $μ\\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime.

For the semi-open system, a partially reflective wall is added around the event horizon. Three aspects of this model are investigated, namely the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra, the greybody factor (GF), and the exceptional point (EP). For the QNM aspect, we identify three distinct behaviors as the frequency-independent reflectivity $\\mathcal{K}$ increasing. The first-type modes approach the real axis and form long-lived quasi-bound states. The second-type modes move toward but do not reach the real axis and retain a finite decay rate. The third-type modes eventually lie on the imaginary axis becoming purely decaying modes. For the GF aspect, GFs exhibit strong oscillations controlled by the distance between the potential and the reflective wall with a real constant reflectivity. In contrast, a Boltzmann-type reflectivity produces only small corrections. Finally, by promoting $\\mathcal{K}$ to a complex parameter, the modified boundary conditions give rise to a second-order EP. Parameterizing the vicinity of such EP, we observe the mode exchange phenomenon, and the deviation of spectra scale with the square root of the deviation of the parameter, as predicted by a Puiseux series expansion."}

Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity."}

We show that the approach used to obtain many of these metrics generically does not lead to the correct solutions to the Einstein equations for the matter sources they purport to represent. This issue originates from applying the Newtonian relation between the tangential velocity and the enclosed mass directly within a relativistic framework, followed by the ad hoc assumption $g(r)=f(r)$ for the metric functions. This procedure leads to an anisotropic fluid with $P_r=-ρ$ and $P_t=-rρ'/2-ρ$, whose density differs from the claimed halo profile and often becomes non-physical near the horizon, violating the weak energy condition. As a result, the obtained spacetimes do not describe black holes embedded in known galactic halos but rather distinct anisotropic configurations unrelated to the intended matter distribution. We demonstrate this problem on several representative examples from the literature, including metrics based on the NFW, Burkert, Einasto, solitonic, pseudo-isothermal, and Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) profiles, as well as the case of the NGC~4649 halo. For each case, the correct Einstein-consistent form of the metric and the associated physical interpretation are provided. Our analysis clarifies the limits of validity of the Newtonian approximation near compact objects and establishes a consistent framework for constructing dark-matter-inspired black-hole geometries within General Relativity."}

The resulting Hubble parameter incorporates contributions from stiff matter and dark energy, the last originating from a scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant. The viability of the model is assessed by using Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and type Ia supernovae data. Best model selection based on information criteria indicates a slight preference for this new framework over the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter model. Stability of the model follows from the positive speed of sound and absence of ``Ostrogradsky ghosts''.

As in the previous work, we employ the analytic Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri method to calculate the systematic bias that can be produced by using noneccentric waveforms in parameter estimation, and we verify the reliability of the method by comparing it with numerical Bayesian parameter estimation results. We generate $10^4$ BNS sources randomly distributed in the parameter space $m_1$-$m_2$-$χ_{\\rm eff}$-$e_0$, where the nuetron star mass is in the range of $1 M_\\odot \\leq m_{1,2}\\leq 2M_\\odot (m_2 \\leq m_1)$, the effective spin is $-0.2 \\leq χ_{\\rm eff} \\leq0 .2$, and the eccentricity (at the reference frequency 10 Hz) is $0 \\leq e_0 \\leq 0.024$. For the true value of the tidal deformability ($λ$) of neutron stars, we assume the equation of state model APR4. For all gravitational-wave signals emitted from the sources, we calculate the systematic biases ($Δθ$) for the chirp mass ($M_c$), symmetric mass ratio ($η$), effective spin ($χ_{\\rm eff}$), and effective tidal deformability ($\\tildeλ$), and obtain generalized distributions of the biases. The distribution of biases in $M_c, η$, and $χ_{\\rm eff}$ shows narrow bands that increase or decrease quadratically with increasing $e_0$, indicating a weak dependence of biases on the three parameters. On the other hand, the biases of $\\tildeλ$ are widely distributed depending on the values of the mass and spin parameters at a given $e_0$. We investigate the implications of biased parameters for the inference of neutron star properties by performing Bayesian parameter estimation for specific cases."}

The model incorporates quartic or sextic self-interactions in the scalar Lagrangian, which support the existence of stationary, solitonic, gravitationally bound solutions. We numerically construct these multi-component systems and investigate how the self-interactions alter their global properties -- specifically the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass $M$, the angular momentum $J$ and the morphology of their ergospheres. A central result is the distinct dependence of the $(ω, M)$ and $(ω, J)$ relations on the parity of the chains. Specifically, systems with an even number of constituents display spiraling curves, while those with an odd number exhibit loop structures. Moreover, we observe that two initially distinct ergospheres merge into a single one as the frequency $ω$ increases. Our analysis also indicates that the quartic interaction imposes more restrictive existence bounds, particularly for odd-numbered chains, thereby restricting stable configurations to the weak-coupling regime. In contrast, the sextic interaction has a weaker effect and enables stable solutions at substantially stronger couplings."}

In the Schwarzschild gravitational context, the analysis emphasizing the role of the so-called Darboux covariance and its intimate connection with KdV conserved quantities was recently introduced by Lenzi & Sopuerta. In a second stage, together with Jaramillo, this led in particular to the identification of the structural role of the \"KdV-Virasoro-Schwarzian derivative\" triangle in this problem. Such a gravitational scattering description dwells naturally on a Cauchy foliation of the spacetime. In the following, we first review--for the Schwarzschild background--this problem in a hyperboloidal foliation scheme, where the infinitesimal time generator of the dynamics is a non-selfadjoint operator. Then, we explore the underlying integrability features through a Lax-pair formulation. Specifically, the main results presented here are i) the explicit proposal of a weak Lax-pair, valid under suitable conditions involving fields at null infinity, with ii) the construction of the associated infinite sequence of isospectral flows. From a broader perspective, the very form of the non-selfadjoint infinitesimal time operator, which neatly separates into two components corresponding to bulk and boundary structures, paves the way for the description of the gravitational dynamics in terms of a \"semi-direct action\" of bulk degrees of freedom onto boundary degrees of freedom. This is akin to the \"wave-mean flow\" approach for black hole strong-gravity dynamics recently proposed in this line of research."}

In this work, we derive the full set of perturbed field equations, impose the quasi-static approximation, and obtain the effective Poisson equation together with the corresponding modified gravitational constant $G_{\\rm eff}$. These ingredients allow us to construct the density contrast evolution equation and analyse the matter growth rate and growth index. Through numerical analysis, we showed that the scalar non-metricity theory is comparable to the well-known $ΛCDM$ model to some extent.

For the GO model, we showed that a spatially flat universe inevitably evolves toward a big rip singularity. At the same time, the inclusion of spatial curvature modifies the expansion rate without removing the finite-time divergence: positive curvature speeds up the formation of the singularity, whereas negative curvature induces transitions between quintessence, de Sitter, and phantom-like regimes. When Kaniadakis entropy corrections are incorporated, the qualitative behavior changes substantially. The modified HDE density admits a stable de Sitter critical point and evolves toward a little rip singularity, in which the Hubble rate diverges only at infinite cosmic time. We further demonstrate that spatial curvature acts solely as a quantitative deformation in this scenario. Although it alters the detailed expansion history, it does not alter the little-rip character of the future singularity. Our results reveal that the asymptotic fate of holographic cosmologies is highly sensitive to the underlying entropy-area relation: the GO model robustly predicts a big rip.
