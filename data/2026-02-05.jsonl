They are especially valuable for systems that work at extremely cold (cryogenic) temperatures because they are strong, lightweight, and don't transfer heat easily.\n  In this study, researchers measured how well heat moves through several different types of carbon fiber samples, specifically T300, T700, HS40, M55J, and IMA, at different fiber layouts and densities. These measurements were taken at ultra-cold temperatures ranging from 100 mK to 20 K. The team used a newly developed analysis method to calculate the thermal conductivity for each sample. Finally, they shared how each material behaved at different temperatures and compared their findings to previous research."}

We find small linear temporal changes in the scale and skew terms (less than 0.2 pixels in 13 years) which are generally dominated by intrinsic scatter (up to $\\pm$ 0.3 pixels). Concurrently, a larger filter-dependent offset in the scale term is observed, with a maximum difference of 0.3 pixels between F275W and F814W images at all epochs. A small rotation offset to Gaia of 0.003 $\\pm$ 0.004 degrees is measured from 2009 to mid-2017, after which the offsets are as large as 0.01 degrees, with a large scatter. MAST pipeline processing includes an additional alignment step which corrects UVIS images for any residual linear terms with respect to Gaia DR3 when there are at least 10 matched sources. In addition to any pointing offsets, this step accounts for any evolution in the distortion linear terms described here. For observers requiring high-precision astrometry, we recommend using the tweakreg routine to realign images using a 4-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, rotation, and scale) or a 6-parameter fit (x-shift, y-shift, x-rotation, y-rotation, x-scale, and y-scale) depending on the number of matched sources. We provide links to DrizzlePac tutorials for improving both absolute and relative astrometry in WFC3 images."}

We construct a full quantum processing pipeline and validate its feasibility and accuracy through direct comparison with a classical VLBI pipeline. We recognize that amplitude encoding of large data volumes remains the primary bottleneck in quantum computing; however, the quantized nature of VLBI raw data helps reduce the state-preparation complexity.

In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\\sim0.57$~GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($Δ\\mathfrak{R}/\\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\\langle N\\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\\exp(-0.14h/\\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $Δ\\mathfrak{R}/\\mathfrak{R}+\\langle N\\rangle\\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron."}

Conventional hydrogen sensors often rely on catalytic materials and face limitations such as the need of oxygen purging when operated in fuel cell environments. Here, we report the discovery of a novel hydrogen-sensing mechanism based on organic molecules, without the use of catalytic metals. The sensor is based on a typical vertical stack geometry, containing $\\mathrm{Alq_3}$ as active organic material. Upon exposure to hydrogen, the device shows an increase in resistivity, yielding a reliable sensor signal that varies linearly with hydrogen concentration, temperature, and humidity, and exhibits a relative response of up to 3.5 % at 100 %vol hydrogen. By exposing the sensor to an external magnetic field, the rise and fall times of the sensor response were found to be tunable. This novel organic sensor demonstrates sensitivity across a wide range of hydrogen concentrations under fuel cell-relevant conditions and beyond. This new class of hydrogen sensors with high miniaturization potential and cost efficiency paves the way for real-time hydrogen monitoring and advanced control strategies in fuel cells, the chemical industry, or energy storage applications."}

Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $η$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $η$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case.

While most MOR research focuses on single-domain systems (e.g., structural dynamics or computational fluid mechanics), this work compares MOR techniques for large multi-domain problems to identify methods that remain efficient and accurate at very large scales. In particular, harmonic response simulations of vibroacoustic fluid-structure coupled systems used to compute transfer functions from an input force to either structural acceleration or pressure in the heavy fluid domain are of high interest. To achieve this, the most common MOR techniques based on modal methods and Krylov subspace methods are compared for multi-material systems. To assess the feasibility and accuracy of these techniques for different system sizes, a scalable benchmark model of a water-filled Plexiglass cylinder is developed, with mesh sizes from 10,000 to 1,000,000 Degrees of Freedom (DOF). The quality of the models is assured by validation against experimental data. The geometry, model data, and experimental results are made available so that they can be used as a benchmark for further studies. For systems larger than 100,000 DOF, the investigated modal methods become impractical due to memory limitations, even on powerful workstations. Among the tested techniques, a Krylov subspace two-level orthogonal Arnoldi reduction, combined with symmetrization and conditioning of the system matrices, provides the most accurate and efficient approximation of the target transfer functions - particularly for large-scale models up to 1,000,000 DOF. This approach achieves a speedup of up to 600 times compared to the full model."}

For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe.

Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\\ast}$) as the lens."}

Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\\text{stable}} + n_{\\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\\text{stable}} - n_{\\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes.

To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors."}
