These are composites which exhibit equi-frequency contours (EFC) which correspond to those expected of homogeneous local acoustic media. We show that EFCs for local acoustic media are conics in 2-dimension and quadrics in 3-dimension. In 2-D, the sure signature of negative properties is if the conic is a hyperbola and in 3-D, the sure signature is the presence of hyperboloids. We note that metamaterial coupling (Willis coupling) has the potential of translating these conics and quadrics in the wave-vector plane but that it does not fundamentally change the shape of these geometries. The local effective properties assigned to a composite in such cases are dispersive (frequency dependent) and they satisfy causality considerations. We finally also show that such properties truly characterize the composite in the sense that they can be used to solve scattering problems involving different samples of the composite. We show that this is made possible through the consideration of transition layers. While the sharp-interface model incurs scattering errors exceeding 20\\% at oblique angles, the Drude-layer model restores agreement to within 2\\% without requiring integral-equation or multi-mode expansions, thereby offering a simple yet highly efficient route to accurate scattering predictions in resonant local acoustic metamaterials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5c40\u57df\u58f0\u5b66\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u5c40\u57df\u58f0\u5b66\u4ecb\u8d28\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7b49\u9891\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u9891\u8f6e\u5ed3\u57282D\u4e2d\u662f\u5706\u9525\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u57283D\u4e2d\u662f\u4e8c\u6b21\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u53cc\u66f2\u7ebf\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u662f\u8d1f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u5fd7\u3002\u5a01\u5229\u65af\u8026\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u79fb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4f46\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u5f62\u72b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c40\u57df\u58f0\u5b66\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7b49\u9891\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u659c\u5165\u5c04\u65f6\u6563\u5c04\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9891\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDrude\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5c16\u9510\u754c\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u659c\u5165\u5c04\u65f6\u6563\u5c04\u8bef\u5dee\u8d85\u8fc720%\uff0c\u800cDrude\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u52302%\u4ee5\u5185\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u57df\u6709\u6548\u5c5e\u6027\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\uff0cDrude\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5171\u632f\u5c40\u57df\u58f0\u5b66\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6563\u5c04\u9884\u6d4b\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Compensating these effects is therefore critical to realizing the potential of upcoming extremely large telescopes, a challenging task that requires precise wavefront control. Ultimately, this precision is limited by one's wavefront sensor (WFS) and its capacity to accurately encode phase and amplitude aberrations.\n  Aims: Our attention is on photon noise-limited wavefront sensing in the high-Strehl regime. In particular, we seek fundamental limits to phase and amplitude estimation in addition to a WFS that saturate these bounds.\n  Methods: Information theory is employed for deriving minimum-achievable residual errors, as stipulated by a metric called the Holevo Cramer-Rao bound. Holevo's bound is closely related to another metric called the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, which has already been applied to phase estimation on nearly-corrected wavefronts.\n  Results: We present a WFS that can perfectly extract and phase shift a telescope's piston mode. We show how this phase can be used to tune the apparatus' sensitivity to phase and amplitude, and provide a closed-form expression for the optimal phase shift. For circular apertures, this implementation saturates the fundamental limits, but it can be easily modified to work with arbitrary pupils. Moreover, our proposal uses optics that are manufactureable today and is readily achromatized with geometric phase shifters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u9971\u548c\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u7279\u5217\u5c14\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5730\u57fa\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u57fa\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u53d7\u5927\u6c14\u89c6\u5b81\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u8865\u507f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u5927\u578b\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Holevo Cramer-Rao\u754c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u76f8\u79fb\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u6d3b\u585e\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u7f8e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u76f8\u79fb\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6d3b\u585e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u76f8\u79fb\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5706\u5f62\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u591f\u9971\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u6781\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u53ef\u5236\u9020\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u5143\u4ef6\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u6d88\u8272\u5dee\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u4fee\u6539\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u610f\u5b54\u5f84\u5f62\u72b6\u3002"}}

However, humans are not the only instance of an intelligent, communicating species on Earth, and thus not guide to how we might think about ETI. Here, we explore the potential for the study of non-human species to inform new approaches in SETI research, using firefly communication patterns as an illustrative example. Fireflies communicate their presence through evolved flash patterns distinct from complex visual backgrounds. Extraterrestrial signals may also be identifiable not by their complexity or decodable content, but by the structural properties of the signal, as currently being explored in efforts to decode communication in non-human species across our biosphere. We present a firefly-inspired model for detecting potential technosignatures within environments dominated by ordered astronomical phenomena, such as pulsars. Using pulsar data from the Australia Telescope National Facility, we generate simulated signals that exhibit evolved dissimilarity from the surrounding pulsar population. This approach shifts focus from anthropocentric assumptions about intelligence toward recognizing communication through its fundamental structural properties, specifically, evolutionarily optimized contrast with natural backgrounds. Our model demonstrates that alien signals need not be inherently complicated nor need we decipher their meaning to identify them; rather, signals might be distinguishable as products of selection.

A Ricci-flow-inspired geometric relaxation (with no physical time interpretation) is introduced to drive the metric perturbation toward fixed points sustained by chiral sources while keeping curvature invariants negligible. We show that divergence-free chiral currents can support globally non-trivial torsional holonomy stabilized by topological invariants associated with the fundamental groups pi1(S1) and pi3(S3). Toroidal skyrmionic domains emerge when one chirality dominates, whereas a chiral-flip interference sector enables Moebius-type non-orientable bridges between opposite-chirality regions.

These results identify a purely torsional mechanism, independent of local curvature, through which coherent chiral currents may influence effective gravitational behavior in neutrino-rich environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u624b\u6027\u9a6c\u7ea6\u62c9\u7eb3\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u626d\u8f6c\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u53d1\u6563\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u624b\u6027\u7535\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7531\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u626d\u8f6c\u5b8c\u6574\u7fa4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u624b\u6027\u9a6c\u7ea6\u62c9\u7eb3\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u7535\u6d41\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5f15\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u6001\u626d\u8f6c\u6784\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u7eaf\u626d\u8f6c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53d7Ricci\u6d41\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5ea6\u89c4\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u5728\u9759\u6001\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u9650\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u6c64\u5ddd\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7531\u57fa\u672c\u7fa4\u03c0\u2081(S\u00b9)\u548c\u03c0\u2083(S\u00b3)\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53d1\u6563\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u624b\u6027\u7535\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u626d\u8f6c\u5b8c\u6574\u7fa4\uff0c\u5f53\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u6027\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u73af\u5f62\u65af\u683c\u660e\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u624b\u6027\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5e72\u6d89\u533a\u5219\u5141\u8bb8\u83ab\u6bd4\u4e4c\u65af\u578b\u975e\u5b9a\u5411\u6865\u63a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u7684\u7eaf\u626d\u8f6c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u5e72\u624b\u6027\u7535\u6d41\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e2d\u5fae\u5b50\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u529b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

The 10 cm $\\times$ 10 cm active area of the Thick-GEM features three separate sectors with different sizes of the clearance rim annuli (0.1 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.2 mm) around the 0.7 mm diameter holes. The gas gain is found to depend strongly on the rim size. When operated in Ar/CO$_2$ 70:30 gas, the sector with 0.15 mm annulus rims reaches a gain above 10$^4$ while operating in a stable manner with an acceptably low discharge rate. The gain reach under stable operation is found to be considerably lower in the other two sectors.

This unprecedented combination of space-based and ground-based instruments will provide leading multi-wavelength observational capabilities in gamma-rays, X-rays, optical, and near-infrared bands. The complete observation sequence of each GRB triggered by the SVOM mission consists of three stages, the GRB detections, followed by the on-board and grounded automatic follow-ups, and rapid deep multi-band photometry and spectroscopy re-visit observations. To efficiently organize all grounded instruments performing automatic follow-ups and re-visit observations, we develop a follow-up observation coordinating service (FOCS), which is capable of performing GRB trigger distributing, automatic observation scheduling and observation coordination supporting by providing a user support platform. The FOCS also facilitates the provision of observational planning for ground-based telescopes to conduct synchronized observations of identical celestial regions as SVOM. The FOCS is utilized for the SVOM-dedicated ground-based telescopes as well as for associated partner telescopes. Since the launch of SVOM in June 2024, as the FOCS system joining the operations of SVOM, multiple successful observations have been made for SVOM GRBs. In this paper, we present the goals of the FOCS system as well as the principle and workflow developed to achieve these goals.

We begin by deriving a covariant two-body Dirac equation that, in the absence of DSR modifications, reduces to a Bessel-type wave equation. Incorporating corrections from the chosen DSR model modifies this wave equation, yielding solutions consistent with established results in the low-energy regime. We demonstrate that the effects of DSR modifications become particularly pronounced at large relative distances. For a coupled fermion-antifermion pair, we derive the modified binding energy solutions. By accounting for first-order Planck-scale corrections, we show that the fine-structure constant \u03b1behaves as an energy-dependent running parameter, given by \\(\u03b1_{eff(E)}/\u03b1\\approx 1 - \\frac{E}{4E_p}\\), where E_p is the Planck energy. Binding energy levels are computed using a first-order approximation of the DSR modifications, and the results are applied to positronium-like systems. Our model reveals that DSR modifications induce shifts in the binding energy levels. To the best of our knowledge, DSR-modified two-body equations have not been previously studied.

It features a 500 um pixel pitch, in-pixel amplification and digitization, and low power consumption (around 3-4 mW/cm^2), making it scalable for large-area, multilayer telescope detector planes. The detectors have a designed dynamic range of 25 keV to 700 keV.\n  With these features, AstroPix meets the requirements of future space-based high-energy telescopes and the imaging layers of the Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) detector at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). For the space-based payload, AstroPix is being integrated into sounding rocket and balloon payloads to demonstrate the technical readiness of the devices. For BIC, AstroPix-based imaging layers interleaved within the lead/scintillating-fiber (Pb/SciFi) sampling calorimeter provide granular shower imaging, enabling key performance features such as electron/pion or gamma/neutral-pion separation.\n  As part of the ongoing detector R&D efforts, we have been testing various AstroPix v3 configurations: the single chip, a quad-chip assembly, a three-layer stack of quad chips, and a nine-chip module that represents the smallest prototype unit of the BIC imaging layer.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "Pulsar searching with next-generation radio telescopes requires efficiently sifting through millions of candidates generated by search pipelines to identify the most promising ones. This challenge has motivated the utilization of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based tools. In this work, we explore an optimized pulsar search pipeline that utilizes deep learning to sift ``snapshot'' candidates generated by folding de-dispersed time series data. This approach significantly accelerates the search process by reducing the time spent on the folding step. We also developed a script to generate simulated pulsars for benchmarking and model fine-tuning. The benchmark analysis used the NGC 5904 globular cluster data and simulated pulsar data, showing that our pipeline reduces candidate folding time by a factor of $\\sim$10 and achieves 100% recall by recovering all known detectable pulsars in the restricted parameter space. We also tested the speed-up using data of known pulsars from a single observation in the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-metre (SMART) survey, achieving a conservatively estimated speed-up factor of 60 in the folding step over a large parameter space. We tested the model's ability to classify pulsar candidates using real data collected from the FAST, GBT, MWA, Arecibo, and Parkes, demonstrating that our method can be generalized to different telescopes. The results show that the optimized pipeline identifies pulsars with an accuracy of 0.983 and a recall of 0.9844 on the real dataset. This approach can be used to improve the processing efficiency for the SMART and is also relevant for future SKA pulsar surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b5b\u9009\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6298\u53e0\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523098.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c98.44%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5c04\u7535\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b5b\u9009\"\u5feb\u7167\"\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u811a\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u62df\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728NGC 5904\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u6298\u53e0\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea610\u500d\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185100%\u53ec\u56de\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u77e5\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u3002\u5728SMART\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6298\u53e0\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f30\u8ba1\u52a0\u901f60\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8SMART\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u6765SKA\u8109\u51b2\u661f\u5de1\u5929\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

Among its key observational modes, slitless spectral observation allows simultaneous imaging and spectral data acquisition over a wide field of view, offering significant advantages for astrophysical studies. Currently, the CSST is in the development phase and lacks real observational data. As a result, the development of its data processing pipeline and scientific pre-research must rely on the mock data generated through simulations. This work focuses on developing a simulation framework for the CSST slitless spectral imaging system, analyzing its spectral dispersing properties and structural design. Additionally, the detection performance of the slitless spectral system is assessed for various astrophysical targets. Simulation results demonstrate that nearly all 1st order spectra are accompanied by corresponding 0th order images, facilitating accurate source identification.

Starting from a simple model with known effects, we derive the strain amplitude and power spectrum for primordial gravitational waves, both of which are affected by the symmetry breaking. Through this, we directly find predictions for the tensor spectral index and tensor-to-scalar which are different from general relativity. By considering the known sensitivity curves for NANOGrav, SKA, THEIA, $\u03bc$-ARES, ASTROD-GW, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, AION-km, AEDGE, ET, and aLIGO, we place observability limits on the parameters controlling the diffeomorphism violation. For instance, we find that aLIGO could observe signals for \\(s_{00} \\lesssim -0.1\\), while more sensitive future detectors like LISA and DECIGO could probe violations as small as \\(s_{00} \\approx -5 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(-3 \\times 10^{-3}\\), respectively. Finally, we consider the existing constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\u0394N_{\\rm eff}$ which is tightly constrained by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis, where we find that $\u0394N_{\\rm eff}$ only weakly depends on the symmetry breaking but places a lower bound on the coefficients which is consistent with available bounds from the speed of gravitational waves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u89c2\u6d4b\u539f\u521d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7834\u7f3a\u5370\u8bb0\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u53d7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u7f3a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u539f\u521d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5e94\u53d8\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u7387\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u4e86\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u8c31\u6307\u6570\u548c\u5f20\u91cf\u6807\u91cf\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u5426\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u539f\u521d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7834\u7f3a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5df2\u77e5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u539f\u521d\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u7684\u5e94\u53d8\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u7387\u8c31\uff0c\u8003\u8651NANOGrav\u3001SKA\u3001THEIA\u3001\u03bc-ARES\u3001ASTROD-GW\u3001LISA\u3001BBO\u3001DECIGO\u3001CE\u3001AION-km\u3001AEDGE\u3001ET\u548caLIGO\u7b49\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u9650\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "aLIGO\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4bs_{00}\u2272-0.1\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u7075\u654f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5982LISA\u548cDECIGO\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4bs_{00}\u2248-5\u00d710^{-4}\u548c-3\u00d710^{-3}\u7684\u7834\u7f3a\u3002\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u6838\u5408\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u0394N_{eff}\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u9650\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5177\u6709\u63a2\u6d4b\u539f\u521d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u540c\u80da\u7834\u7f3a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u68c0\u9a8c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a97\u53e3\u3002"}}

This package can generate one-dimensional spectra corresponding to local physical properties at specific positions according to a series of two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters of target sources. In this way, it can produce a spatially resolved spectral cube of the target source. Two-dimensional distributions of physical parameters, including surface brightness, stellar population, and line-of-sight velocity, can be modeled using the parametric model or based on real observational data and numerical simulation data. For the generation of one-dimensional spectra, we have considered four types of spectra, including the stellar continuum spectra, ionized gas emission lines, AGN spectra, and stellar spectra.

(in press)", "summary": "The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe highlighted General Relativity's inability to naturally account for dark energy without invoking a finely tuned cosmological constant. In response, a wide range of alternative paradigms have been proposed. Among these, Teleparallel Gravity and Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity, which depart from the Riemannian framework of General Relativity and instead rely on torsion or non-metricity to describe gravitational interactions, have gained increasing attention in recent years. We explore extensions of these non-Riemannian approaches, aiming to replicate the observed late-time acceleration of the universe by emulating the cosmological constant's role. We also evaluate the consistency of these theories with local gravity constraints by studying their static, spherically symmetric solutions. We show that although some models can reproduce the desired cosmological behavior, they often fail to meet Solar System observational bounds, particularly through deviations in the predicted Eddington parameter. Our findings underscore the need for a unified approach that tests modified gravity theories across both cosmological and local scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86Teleparallel Gravity\u548cSymmetric Teleparallel Gravity\u7b49\u975e\u9ece\u66fc\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u590d\u5236\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5374\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76Teleparallel Gravity\u548cSymmetric Teleparallel Gravity\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u9759\u6001\u7403\u5bf9\u79f0\u89e3\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5f15\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u5236\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u592a\u9633\u7cfb\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7231\u4e01\u987f\u53c2\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5728\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fee\u6b63\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

An integrated system model incorporating five static and two dynamic error sub-models was established. Wavefront errors were calculated for each sub-model and compared to the integrated system error to quantify the individual contributions to image degradation. At the detector level, wavefront error, point spread function (PSF), and ellipticity were evaluated across the full field of view (FOV). The average radius of 80\\% encircled energy (REE80) of the PSF under full-error conditions was determined for 25 field points, yielding a value of 0.114 arcseconds. Furthermore, the calculations indicate a correlation between the wavefront distribution and the ellipticity distribution within the optical system. By optimizing the wavefront distribution, it is possible to adjust the ellipticity distribution of the PSF across the full FOV.

To rapidly estimate stray-light levels under realistic, complex operational conditions, we developed an analytical model tailored to the China Space Station Telescope (CSST).

We construct a specific exponential $f(Q)$ model as $f(Q) = Q + \u03b7_1 Q_0\\left(1 - e^{-\u03b7_2 \\sqrt{Q/Q_0}}\\right)$, designed to smoothly deviate from General Relativity and accommodate both early-time inflation and late-time accelerated expansion. By employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we constrain the model parameters $\u03b7_1$, $\u03b7_2$, $H_0$, and $\u03a9_{m_0}$ using a combination of cosmic chronometers (CC), Pantheon, and Pantheon$^+$ Supernovae datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that the model consistently supports a late-time acceleration scenario and is in good agreement with current cosmological observations. We extensively analyze the dynamical behavior of the model using key cosmological diagnostics, including the deceleration parameter, equation of state, energy density parameters, Statefinder, and Om diagnostics. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and distance modulus $\u03bc(z)$ show strong consistency with $\u039b$CDM and observational data, while subtle deviations at higher redshifts highlight the value of multi-probe observations. In addition, the examination of energy conditions shows that, in accordance with cosmic acceleration, the Strong Energy Condition (SEC) is broken at lower redshifts while the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and Null Energy Condition (NEC) are satisfied.

This paper presents an overview of the simulation framework, detailing its implementation and components. Built upon the GalSim package and incorporating the latest CSST instrumental specifications, our pipeline generates pixel-level mock observations that closely replicate the expected instrumental and observational conditions. The simulation suite integrates realistic astrophysical object catalogs, instrumental effects, point spread function (PSF) modeling, and observational noises to produce accurate synthetic data. We describe the key processing stages of the simulation, from constructing the input object catalogs to modeling the telescope optics and detector responses. Furthermore, we introduce the most recent release of simulated datasets, which provide a crucial testbed for data processing pipeline developments, calibration strategies, and scientific analyses, ensuring that CSST will meet its stringent requirements.

We find that the Interacting model predicts a Hubble constant of $h = 0.659 \\pm 0.0063$, deviating from the $\u039b$CDM value by approximately $2.93\u03c3$, while the Non-Interacting model shows a $3.78\u03c3$ deviation. The positive coupling parameter (\\( \u03b3> 0 \\)) further suggests a transfer of energy from dark matter to dark energy. According to the Jeffreys scale, the Interacting model shows moderate evidence against the $\u039b$CDM model, whereas the Non-Interacting model shows only inconclusive evidence. Further, we investigate both models through the lens of dynamical systems analysis. We formulate the cosmological evolution equations with a phenomenological interaction term and recast them into an autonomous system to study the qualitative behavior of cosmic expansion. Critical points of the system are identified and analyzed to study the corresponding cosmological dynamics. In the interacting model, we obtained five critical points, whereas in the non-interacting scenario, four distinct sets of critical points were identified. The obtained critical points, governed by cosmological parameters, represent distinct cosmic epochs, commencing from the early time stiff matter domination to late-time acceleration. Their stability is examined through linear stability analysis under appropriate physical constraints. The evolution of background cosmological parameters are also examined in terms of the dynamical system variable, and the obtained values align with observational results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u52bf\u548c\u6697\u533a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DESI DR2\u3001Ia\u578b\u8d85\u65b0\u661f\u548c\u538b\u7f29CMB\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u54c8\u52c3\u5e38\u6570\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u4ece\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5230\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u5b87\u5b99\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u548c\u54c8\u52c3\u5f20\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u6765\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u6307\u6570\u52bf\u548c\u6697\u533a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bh=0.659\u00b10.0063\uff0c\u4e0e\u039bCDM\u504f\u5dee2.93\u03c3\uff1b\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee3.78\u03c3\u3002\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u793a\u4ece\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u5230\u6697\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa5\u4e2a\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u5b87\u5b99\u65f6\u671f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u039bCDM\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u8bc1\u636e\u53cd\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u521a\u6027\u7269\u8d28\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5230\u665a\u671f\u52a0\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

The analysis integrates the definition of the mission profile, the instrumental concept architecture, and an error budget that breaks down the key contributors to the sub-micro arcses precision required for a single measurement. A portion of this budget addresses photo-center estimation for both the target and calibration stars used in differential astrometry. Other major contributors are related to instrumental control of systematics in the reconstruction of differential angle measurements from pixel data (focal plane calibration) to on sky line of sight (telescope distortion calibration). End-of-mission astrometry requires multiple observations (typically 100) of the same target distributed over the mission lifetime. We assess the mission profile to estimate the fraction of survey time required for astrometric survey to achieve the science objective. The proposed architecture of the instrument concept is derived from error budget and mission constraints based on a large visible detector array composed of an assembly of multiple CMOS sensor chips resulting in an overall gigapixel focal plane.

Our result leads to the concepts of barriers (= null hypersurfaces separating the space-time into disjoint regions) and black regions (= time-oriented regions bounded by barriers). These objects naturally include (smooth) event horizons and (smoothly bounded) black holes.

Bayesian inference for GW lensing with conventional sampling methods is costly, and the problem is exacerbated by the rapidly growing GW catalog. Moreover, assessing the statistical significance of lensed candidates requires thousands, if not millions, of simulations to estimate the background from noise fluctuations and waveform systematics, which is infeasible with standard samplers. We present a novel method, \\texttt{DINGO-lensing}, for performing inference on lensed GWs, extending the neural posterior estimation framework \\texttt{DINGO}. By comparing our results with those using conventional samplers, we show that the compute time of parameter estimation of lensed GWs can be reduced from weeks to seconds, while preserving accuracy both in the posterior distributions and the evidence ratios. We train our neural networks with LIGO detector noise at design sensitivity and a lens model that accommodates two overlapping chirps with opposite parity. We show that the lensing parameters are recovered with millisecond precision for the time delays. We also demonstrate that our network can identify signals diffracted by point masses, highlighting its flexibility for searches. By simulating thousands of lensed and nonlensed events, we determine how the detectability changes with different source properties. \\texttt{DINGO-lensing} provides a scalable and efficient avenue for identifying and characterizing gravitationally lensed GW events in the upcoming observing runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DINGO-lensing\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u900f\u955c\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u6570\u5468\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u6570\u79d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u6bd4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u900f\u955c\u5316\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u76ee\u5f55\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u900f\u955c\u5019\u9009\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6DINGO\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5904\u7406LIGO\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u53e0\u5541\u557e\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u900f\u955c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u70b9\u8d28\u91cf\u884d\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u900f\u955c\u53c2\u6570\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u6570\u5468\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u6570\u79d2\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u70b9\u8d28\u91cf\u884d\u5c04\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0d\u540c\u6e90\u7279\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DINGO-lensing\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c2\u6d4b\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u900f\u955c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

We obtained the inner shadow, redshift characteristics, and intensity distribution of thin-disk images of the KTN black hole, as observed by a common observer located at different positions. The results show that increasing the spin parameter progressively deforms the critical curve into a \"D\" shape while simultaneously shrinking and distorting the inner shadow. More importantly, for n = 0.3 at theta_o = 80 degrees, the inner shadow develops a novel \"duck-cap-like\" morphology with a sharply protruding lower-right edge beyond the critical curve. We term this feature the \"extended inner shadow\", a structure distinct from the Kerr case. Unlike the standard inner shadow, it consists partly of photons absorbed by the horizon and partly of photons that avoid both absorption and crossing the disk plane, thus receiving no emission.

Within the symmetric teleparallel framework, a representative $f(Q)$ model is constructed, and the corresponding background cosmological equations are derived. The analysis aims to test whether this geometric formulation yields more consistent realizations of nonminimal matter-geometry couplings. A comprehensive statistical MCMC analysis is performed using cosmic chronometers, DESI BAO DR2, and Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+, DESY5, and Union3 samples.

Upcoming missions like LiteBIRD & CMB-S4 are expected to impose an even more stringent bound on $r$ , potentially excluding further models from the viable landscape. In this evolving observational context, modified gravity theories offer a promising way to reconcile inflationary models with data. In this work, we explore several inflationary models, namely mutated hilltop inflation, D-brane inflation, and Woods-Saxon inflation, within the framework of $f(R, T)$ gravity. The cosmological observable parameters, viz. scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and running of scalar spectral index $n_{sk}$ are estimated for the three models, and their trajectories are plotted in the $n_s-r$ plane.

This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u968f\u673a\u80cc\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5176\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387t^H\uff081/2<H<1\uff09\u8d85\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u221at\u6807\u5ea6\u5f8b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ecePTA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6b64\u7c7b\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u548c\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u539f\u521d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\u7b49\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd9\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u539f\u521d\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u81a8\u80c0\u5b87\u5b99\u73af\u5883\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u968f\u673a\u80cc\u666f\u9075\u5faa\u5206\u6570\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u589e\u957f\u901f\u7387t^H\u5feb\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5e03\u6717\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u81a8\u80c0\u5b87\u5b99\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u4ecePTA\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u7206\u70b8\u540e\u65e9\u671f\u5b87\u5b99\u6761\u4ef6\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The methods are shown to be equivalent when the condition $M'' S' - S'' M' \\neq 0$ holds, while deviations appear when this relation fails, signaling subtle connections between mass $M(r_h)$, entropy $S(r_h)$, and topological structure, with $r_h$ being the horizon radius. We first verify this equivalence to Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, recovering known classifications and confirming the consistency of our approach with respect to the validity of the above condition. We then extend the analysis to four-dimensional black strings, regarded as cylindrically symmetric black hole solutions in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Our results show that both neutral and charged black strings possess the same global topological number, $W = +1$, implying that electric charge does not influence their topological classification. This insensitivity to charge mirrors earlier findings for BTZ black holes in three dimensions, suggesting that it may represent a universal property of cylindrically symmetric black holes in AdS backgrounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u03c6\u6620\u5c04\u62d3\u6251\u7535\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7559\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f20\u7ed5\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ed1\u6d1e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u71b5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1Schwarzschild\u548cReissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4ee5\u53ca\u56db\u7ef4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7535\u8377\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f20\u7ed5\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u9ed1\u6d1e\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u7535\u8377\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u03c6\u6620\u5c04\u62d3\u6251\u7535\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7559\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f20\u7ed5\u6570\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6761\u4ef6M''S' - S''M' \u2260 0\u65f6\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790Schwarzschild\u3001Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m\u9ed1\u6d1e\u548c\u56db\u7ef4\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5f53M''S' - S''M' \u2260 0\u65f6\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u4e2d\u6027\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u548c\u5e26\u7535\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u62d3\u6251\u6570W = +1\uff1b\u7535\u8377\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u7f20\u7ed5\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7b49\u4ef7\uff1b\u7535\u8377\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f26\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u4e86AdS\u80cc\u666f\u4e2d\u67f1\u5bf9\u79f0\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u8d28\u3002"}}

The inherently nonlinear nature of the FFE equations makes finding exact solutions a challenging task. This paper explores an innovative approach to solving these equations by foliating spacetime into two-dimensional surfaces, specifically tailored to the geometry of electromagnetic fields. The foliation approach exploits the fact that the kernel of the force-free field defines an involutive distribution, naturally lending itself to a geometric decomposition. This method has previously been applied with great success in Kerr and FLRW spacetimes. By extending this formalism, we develop new exact solutions to the FFE equations in several distinct spacetimes, including cases where the metric remains partially undetermined. Additionally, we present a novel class of solutions that smoothly transition between magnetically dominated and electrically dominated regimes over time. Finally, we construct a pair of vacuum degenerate fields in arbitrary axisymmetric spacetimes, further demonstrating the utility of the foliation approach. These results offer a new perspective on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic fields and their geometric underpinnings in various spacetime geometries, broadening the applicability of the framework for understanding the dynamics of highly magnetized plasmas in general relativistic astrophysical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u53f6\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f3a\u78c1\u5316\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u7684\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u78c1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u7535\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u7535\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b50\u661f\u548c\u5438\u79ef\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7b49\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bfb\u627e\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u53f6\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u66f2\u9762\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u529b\u81ea\u7531\u573a\u7684\u6838\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u79ef\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u5728Kerr\u548cFLRW\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684FFE\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ea6\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u672a\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u78c1\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548c\u7535\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u65b0\u89e3\u7c7b\uff1b\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u8f74\u5bf9\u79f0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u771f\u7a7a\u9000\u5316\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53f6\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u78c1\u573a\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike $f(R,T)$ or $f(R,\\mathcal L_m)$ theories, this construction alters how matter curves spacetime without introducing extra geometric degrees of freedom, thereby remaining consistent with local tests of gravity. Physically, the factor $\u03c6(T)\\mathcal L_m$ can be interpreted as an effective renormalization of the matter sector, relevant at high densities and smoothly reducing to GR at low densities. Within this setup we identify a robust window in parameter space leading to a smooth and nonsingular cosmological bounce, with bounded density, finite $\\dot H>0$ at the bounce, and preservation of the infrared limit where $\u039b$CDM is recovered.

While its equivalence to the Iyer-Wald formalism is well understood in pure gravity theories, its validity in matter-coupled theories remains less clear and has even been questioned in the literature. In this work, we revisit this issue and demonstrate that the equivalence between the Euclidean action method and the Iyer-Wald formalism persists in matter-coupled scenarios. We apply the resulting formulation to two representative examples of such theories, and in both cases, the Euclidean approach performs smoothly. We further identify situations where the method may encounter subtleties due to the special properties of certain matter fields. Our results clarify when background subtraction remains reliable beyond pure gravity and when additional care is necessary.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u80cc\u666f\u51cf\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u8d28\u8026\u5408\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e0eIyer-Wald\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u6b8a\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u6ce8\u610f\u3002", "motivation": "\u80cc\u666f\u51cf\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7eaf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u4e0eIyer-Wald\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b49\u4ef7\u5df2\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u8d28\u8026\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eIyer-Wald\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728\u7269\u8d28\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7269\u8d28\u8026\u5408\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u4f5c\u7528\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eIyer-Wald\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ecd\u7136\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u987a\u5229\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u80cc\u666f\u51cf\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u7eaf\u5f15\u529b\u7406\u8bba\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u6b8a\u7269\u8d28\u573a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u6ce8\u610f\u3002"}}
