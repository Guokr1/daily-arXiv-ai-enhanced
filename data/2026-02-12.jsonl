In particular, a jump in magnetic field strength, observed by V1 in 2020.4 at 149.3 au from the Sun, was followed by a distinct \"hump\" and persistently strong magnetic field, both requiring theoretical explanation. This paper offers an interpretation of those observations using a self-consistent, MHD model of the solar wind - LISM interaction driven by the OMNI and interplanetary scintillation data combined with a turbulence analysis of Voyager data. Our simulations convincingly demonstrate that global, solar-cycle-driven compressions, on hitting the heliopause, can reproduce those puzzling V1 observations. They appear to be associated with solar cycle 24, whereas similar interstellar magnetic field structures can occur once per cycle. The turbulence analysis reveals time-dependent magnetic compressibility that persists up to 165 au at scales below 10 days. Turbulence intermittency at scales below 1 hour is mostly confined to specific intervals, possibly associated with a broad foreshock region. The apparent disappearance of intermittency since 2022 reflects the turbulence weakening rather than a fundamental change in VLISM properties. We predict that V1 will record relatively strong magnetic field strengths until $\\sim$2030, followed by weaker, infrequent perturbations. At V2, we expect multiple solar-driven compressions before 2026, followed by a major event induced by solar cycle 25 around 2030. New Horizons is expected to cross the termination shock at 80$\\pm$ au in 2031."}

Focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation enables such control by locally modifying the spin-wave dispersion in yttrium iron garnet (YIG), yet the underlying crystallographic mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present an experimentally validated framework that attributes FIB-induced spin-wave steering to magnetoelastic effects arising from irradiation-induced lattice dislocations. Following FIB irradiation and wet-chemical etching, local height profiles were obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used as fixed geometric constraints in fits of spin-wave dispersion relations measured by time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (trMOKE) microscopy. The dispersion relation was extended by an explicit magnetoelastic field term, treated as a fit parameter. Its evolution reveals three successive deformation regimes, elastic, plastic, and partial amorphization, explaining the observed non-monotonic dependence of the spin-wave wavelength on ion dose. A three-phase deformation scenario based on SRIM simulations reproduces the extracted magnetoelastic field trends, validating the fitting approach. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating strain tensors derived from the experimental magnetoelastic field reproduce the characteristic non-monotonic wavelength behavior. These results establish a physical basis for FIB-engineered graded-index (GRIN) spin-wave landscapes and magnetoelastically programmable magnonic devices."}

We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05<D<5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity."}

Traditionally, photoelectrical signals are transmitted from the cryogenic region to the outside using coaxial cables through vacuum feedthroughs on the cryostats. In this paper, we investigate an analog optical transmission method in which the raw electrical signals are converted into optical signals with light intensity linearly proportional to the electrical amplitude, transmitted out of the cryogenic environment through optical fiber, and subsequently converted back into electrical signals by photoelectric devices while preserving the signal waveform. This new approach offers advantages, including low attenuation over long-distance transmission and reduced crosstalk across the feedthroughs. Additionally, the low-temperature optical wavelength multiplexing scheme has been investigated and applied, increasing the transmission capability of a single fiber. At -100 degree Celsius, the proposed analog optical readout system achieves a -3dB bandwidth of larger than 150MHz, a dynamic range of up to 500mV, and a low cryogenic-region power consumption of 70mW per channel, demonstrating its strong potential for low-temperature experiments."}

By integrating 3D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with flow matching, we effectively represent high-dimensional cosmological structures. The Wavelet Transform addresses the ``void problem'' by translating spatial emptiness into spectral sparsity. It decouples high-frequency details from low-frequency structures through spatial compression, and wavelet-space velocity fields facilitate stable ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers with large step sizes. Using large-scale cosmological $N$-body simulations, at $128^3$ resolution, we achieve up to $50\\times$ faster sampling than diffusion models, combining a $10\\times$ reduction in integration steps with lower per-step computational cost from wavelet compression.

The superposition of the two phase-locked RF voltages produces an amplitude-beating field whose slowly varying envelope modulates the deflection radius, transforming the circular scan into a controlled spiral on the detector plane. A detailed theoretical model describing the electron dynamics under two phase-locked RF voltages with different frequencies was derived, yielding analytical expressions for the transverse velocity and radius-vector components at the deflector exit. Spiral scanning will allow measurements with picosecond resolution in a time range 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the period of the circular scanning."}

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy.

Part I establishes the theoretical framework, covering cosmology, inflation, and the principles of analog gravity. Part II analyzes particle production in various inflationary models, showing that scalar and vector fields can account for observed dark matter abundance, especially through tachyonic instabilities. Part III explores BEC experiments, mapping phonons to scalar fields in expanding universes. We demonstrate the reconstruction of expansion histories, reinterpret production as a scattering problem, and propose methods to measure entanglement between produced pairs. Finally, Part IV addresses quantum vacuum ambiguities and the impact of non-adiabatic transitions during the \"switch-on\" and \"switch-off\" of expansion.\n  Ultimately, this work highlights the viability of cosmological particle production for dark matter and the power of analog experiments to enhance our understanding of quantum effects in curved spacetimes."}

Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources."}

Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors."}

HWO will directly image and characterize Earth-like exoplanet and their atmospheres, with the capability to detect biosignatures and potentially answer the question of whether we are we alone. HWO will also serve as a powerful general astrophysics observatory, enabling breakthroughs in galaxy evolution, stellar astrophysics, and dark matter studies. Currently in pre-formulation, the project has established Exploratory Analytic Cases (EACs), a series of architectural concept designs used to assess the mission's demanding science objectives while exploring challenging engineering parameters. This paper describes the first three EACs, starting with observing strategies and error budget formulation and then progressing to design formulations, trade studies and lessons learned; this paper also discusses the integrated modeling pipeline, a key multidisciplinary system-level analysis capability, and analysis findings as applied to the first EAC. These activities set the stage for the follow on EACs 4 and 5, which will further explore the trade space and prepare for the baseline design that will support the Mission Concept Review (MCR)."}

The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schrödinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics."}

Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center.\n  We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=αρ-ζρ^γ$, where the polytropic index $γ$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters.\n  Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter."}

Starting from a wide class of spherically symmetric spacetimes, we write down the covariant Hamiltonian constraints that under dynamical flow give rise to metrics of many spherically symmetric gravity models. Gravity is minimally coupled to a dust field. The constraint equations are solved for the Hamiltonian evolution and simple equations for the location of the outer boundary of the dust versus time and the apparent horizons in terms of shape functions are obtained. The dust density is not assumed to be homogeneous inside the collapsing ball. In many cases, the effective quantum gravity effects stop the collapse of the dust matter field, then causes the dust field to expand thus creating a bounce at a minimum radius and avoiding the classical singularity. Using this formalism, we examine several quantum-inspired gravity metrics to obtain bounce results either previously obtained by different methods or new results."}

Starting from a general metric characterized by an arbitrary lapse function and areal radius, we derive curvature invariants, establish regularity conditions at the wormhole throat, and reduce the Klein-Gordon equation to a Helmholtz-type radial wave equation. This formulation naturally leads to a position- and frequency-dependent effective refractive index determined by the underlying spacetime geometry and Lorentz-violating structure, resulting in effective frequency-dependent wave-optical behavior. We show that divergences of the refractive index coincide with Killing horizons, while curvature-induced turning points control reflection, transmission, and confinement of scalar waves. By analyzing constant, linear, and quadratic lapse profiles, we identify horizonless transmission regimes, asymmetric wave propagation, and multi-horizon trapping structures. Our results reveal that Lorentz violation can significantly modify wave-optical properties of curved spacetime, generating graded-index analogues and geometric confinement of modes without curvature singularities. This unified optical perspective provides a robust framework for investigating wave scattering, resonances, and potential observational signatures in Lorentz-violating gravitational backgrounds."}

For a massless scalar field $Ψ$ in the Hartle-Hawking state and with arbitrary curvature coupling, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value $\\langle Ψ^2 \\rangle_{\\textrm{ren}}$. The monopole produces a solid-angle deficit and makes the spacetime non-Ricci-flat. Working perturbatively in the monopole parameter $η$ and retaining terms through $O(η^2)$, we find that $\\langle Ψ^2 \\rangle_{\\textrm{ren}}$ on the horizon splits into two contributions: a genuinely monopole-induced term evaluated at the horizon and the usual Schwarzschild result - with the event horizon radius modified by the presence of $η$. Our result parallels earlier analyses for Schwarzschild black holes pierced by a cosmic string."}

We present a full Bayesian analysis of tidal heating in equatorial eccentric EMRIs by performing injection-recovery studies and inferring posterior constraints on the reflectivity parameter $|\\mathcal{R}|^2$ while sampling in the full EMRI parameter space. We find that in the strong-field regime the posterior uncertainties are smaller, indicating a stronger constraining capability on the tidal heating. Using two-year signals with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $ρ=50$, EMRIs can put bounds on $|\\mathcal{R}|^2$ at the level of $10^{-3}$--$ 10^{-4}$ for a rapidly spinning central object. Moreover, we show that neglecting the tidal heating can induce clear systematic biases in the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system. These results establish EMRIs as promising precision probes for detecting and constraining black hole event horizons."}
