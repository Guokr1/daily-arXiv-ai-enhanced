We also demonstrate that the accompanied vector field can be generated via the Newman-Janis algorithm from a simple spherical vector field, which together with the Schwarzschild metric constitutes a solution to the same bumblebee model. It is probably the simplest example of a theory and its black-hole solutions for the Newman-Janis algorithm to hold except for general relativity."}

Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated \"worst-case\" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\\sim 20\\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power."}

By imposing such twists, the original lattice topology is preserved, while mirror symmetries are strategically broken through modifying a single geometric parameter, allowing wave characteristics to be adjusted without additional resonators or mass augmentation. The complex-valued Bloch-Floquet analysis reveals that twisting activates two distinct wave attenuation mechanisms: Bragg-type band gaps associated with periodicity-induced scattering, and polarization-dependent band gaps arising from longitudinal-torsional mode coupling and avoided crossings. To obtain qualitative and quantitative insight into these mechanisms, a simplified analytical model with coupled translational and rotational degrees of freedom is considered. The finite-element wave transmission calculations are experimentally validated on SLA-printed three-cell specimens, for which wave attenuation reaches up to 20 dB within the predicted band-gap frequencies. Note that high prediction accuracy requires accounting for viscoelastic material behavior, underscoring the importance of material behavior on the wave propagation characteristics. Overall, the findings show that modest geometric modifications to a classical Kelvin-cell lattice can enhance wave-filtering behavior, offering a tractable design strategy for vibration control in lightweight architected lattices."}

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures."}

While traditional metagratings focus on channeling energy into higher-order Floquet modes for a fixed incidence angle, we leverage the fundamental mode as a versatile degree of freedom to engineer spatial dispersion over a continuous angular spectrum. By strategically distributing non-uniformly loaded metallic wires and rigorously modeling their mutual interactions through an impedance-matrix formulation, we realize prescribed angular transfer functions with high efficiency. In particular, the framework is validated at 3.5 GHz through full-wave simulations of (i) low-pass, (ii) high-pass, and (iii) all-pass spatial filters. The results demonstrate that fundamental-mode engineering in non-uniform metagratins offers a highly efficient platform for advanced spatial wave manipulation."}

Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability.\n  In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys.\n  This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems."}

We show that the same geometry, distinguished by its logarithmic asymptotic structure, emerges as the unique static solution of Einstein gravity coupled to an exponential nonlinear electrodynamics. We trace the origin of this correspondence and prove that this geometry belongs to a unique class of metrics constituting the intersection of the moduli spaces of the static and circularly symmetric sectors of the two theories, thereby revealing a dynamical equivalence between them. An explicit mapping is established between the global charges of the nonlinearly charged black holes and the parameters governing the quantum backreaction in New Massive Gravity, allowing for a natural reinterpretation of the quantum imprints in terms of classical charges. A detailed analysis of the horizon structure of these spacetimes is presented. In addition, the full thermodynamics of the more general configurations is constructed using the Iyer--Wald formalism, from which we derive the first law and the associated Smarr relation. Altogether, our results provide a classical realization of a semiclassical spacetime and point toward a broader correspondence between higher-curvature corrections in quantum gravity and nonlinear effects in self-gravitating electrodynamics in three dimensions."}

In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter."}

In the classical limit, while the scale dependence of Newton's constant does not affect the classical behavior, the running of the cosmological constant can contribute to the classical solutions. Moreover, we show that the quantum behavior in the ultraviolet regime acts toward suppressing singularity formation in all cases, independently of how the renormalization-group scale is identified with spacetime coordinates and of the relative magnitudes of the ultraviolet fixed points of the running Newton's constant and cosmological constant."}

While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations."}

By analyzing the null geodesics, we determine the photon sphere radius and the critical impact parameter, deriving the geometric capture cross section and the classical differential scattering cross section. Utilizing the partial-wave method, we numerically compute the absorption and scattering cross sections across a broad frequency range. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with the low-frequency limit and the high-frequency sinc approximation, as well as with the semiclassical glory approximation. We analyze the dependence of the spectra on the charge and the regularization parameter (Hubble length). Under the horizon-radius normalization, we observe that the total absorption cross section increases with the regularization parameter, a behavior we attribute to the variation of the dimensionless mass. Furthermore, by comparing Frolov, Reissner--Nordström, and Hayward black holes, we demonstrate that their absorption and scattering patterns are nearly indistinguishable when their critical impact parameters or glory impact parameters are matched. This indicates that the photon sphere geometry predominantly governs scalar field interactions, while the detailed core structure plays a secondary role. Our work underscores the potential of wave-based probes to test regular black hole geometries and their observable imprints."}

In this work we investigate how spacetime non-metricity can be probed through high-precision observations, focusing on atomic clocks and gravitational waves as complementary tools. Working within Weyl geometry as a minimal realization of vectorial non-metricity, we formulate observable effects in a gauge-invariant manner and show that they are associated with path-dependent length transport governed by the Weyl field strength. We derive constraints from atomic-clock experiments and demonstrate that, although gravitational waves do not directly source the Weyl field at linear order, its dynamical contribution induces a backreaction on gravitational-wave propagation, leading to an anomalous strain. As a result, the absence of deviations from General Relativity in current gravitational-wave observations already places meaningful and strong constraints on dynamical non-metric degrees of freedom."}

We validate RICK's correctness and performance against real observational data from both MeerKAT and LOFAR. Our results demonstrate that the HeFFTe-based implementation offers substantial performance advantages, particularly when running on GPUs, and scales effectively with large pixel resolutions and a high number of frequency planes. This new architecture overcomes the critical scaling limitations identified in previous work (Paper II, Paper III), where communication overheads consumed up to 96% of the runtime due to the necessity of communicating the entire grid.

To appear in EPJC", "summary": "The simplest approach to include a mass into the electromagnetic vector potential is to modify the Einstein-Maxwell action to the Einstein-Proca form. There are currently no exact analytical solutions for this scenario. However, by using perturbation theory, where both the Proca mass and the black hole charge are small parameters, it is possible to find an exact analytical solution. In this solution, the metric tensor remains unchanged, but the vector potential deviates from the Coulomb potential. In particular, even if the Proca mass is limited by the value $m_γ<10^{-48}\\text{g}$, which is the current experimental upper limit for photon mass, it makes a significant contribution to the dynamical equations. In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and charged particles in the vicinity of a weakly Proca-charged black hole, and test the observational implications of the solution of the Einstein-Proca equations for gravitational bending, the black hole shadow, and the fit to the orbits of the Galactic center flares observed by the near-infrared GRAVITY instrument. We find that only extremely cold photons, which are likely scattered before reaching a distant observer, could reveal the non-zero photon mass effect through the black hole shadow. For the Galactic center flare analysis we obtained constraints on the dimensionless Proca parameter to $μ\\leq 0.125$ for the electric interaction parameter in the range $-1.1 < \\mathrm{Q} < 0.5$, which can be potentially tested by future GRAVITY flare astrometry. Since the Proca parameter is coupled to the black hole mass, the effect of the Proca charge becomes more pronounced for supermassive black holes compared to stellar-mass objects. Our perturbative treatment remains valid essentially up to the horizon, with divergences appearing only in the immediate near-horizon region, where a fully non-perturbative analysis would be required."}

Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter."}

In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data."}

Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated \"worst-case\" scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\\sim 20\\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power."}

While the identification of a geometric origin for time's arrow is compelling in the case of brane-world models, we point out a possible tension between the proposed volume growth and the observational stability of the effective four-dimensional Newton's gravitational constant, G, that may arise in Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. In standard KK approaches, such volume growth induces a time-variation of G that exceeds Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) bounds by many orders of magnitude. To resolve this tension while preserving the author's key insight in the Kaluza-Klein case, we propose an extension: the \"shape-dynamic arrow of time\". By utilizing the scale-invariant monotonicity of Perelman's nu-entropy under normalized Ricci flow, we demonstrate how an arrow of time can emerge from the geometric smoothing of extra dimensions at fixed volume, thereby satisfying observational constraints on fundamental constants."}

This development provides a clear and systematic route to constructing new configurations with nontrivial Baryonic charge and magnetic field, leveraging the fact that the Einstein--Scalar--Maxwell system is considerably more tractable, thanks to powerful solution-generating techniques. In this work, we exploit the framework that allows compact sources dressed by scalar fields to be consistently embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds, and we construct their dual counterparts carrying Baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The resulting Baryonic charge is expressed directly in terms of the parameters characterizing the seed spacetime, and a corresponding quantization condition involving these parameters is explicitly derived. Consequently, the mass and the Baryonic charge are not independent parameters. These results provide a closed analytic formula for the black hole mass parameter in terms of the Baryonic charge and the magnetic field. This relation between the mass parameter and the Baryonic charge is linear for large values of the mass, while significant deviations from linearity arise if the mass takes intermediate values."}

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $>10\\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures."}
