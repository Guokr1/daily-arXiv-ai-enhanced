In this paper, we investigate the shadows produced by this geometry to identify deviations from the standard Schwarzschild solution. Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects."}

The Yu--Toda--Fukuyama (YTF) trilinear equation of Ref.~\\cite{YuTodaSasaFukuyama:1998hierarchy} is shown to represent not a particular evolution equation but a universal kernel that generates the entire $(3+1)$--dimensional hierarchy by selecting commuting flows. The frequently quoted trilinear equation of Ref.~\\cite{YTSF1998} is identified as one such flow of this kernel. We further show that stationary axisymmetric gravity corresponds to a projective realization of the YTF kernel rather than to any single flow. Imposing $\\GL(2)$ covariance and homogeneity on the kernel leads uniquely to a gravitational trilinear kernel $\\mathcal{Y}(τ_0,τ_1)$, whose vanishing reproduces the Ernst equation. The Tomimatsu--Sato family \\cite{Tomimatsu1972} and related bilinear solutions are shown to arise as degenerate submanifolds of this projected trilinear structure, in agreement with the multilinear analysis of Ref.~\\cite{Fukuyama:2025TS}. These results establish a unified structural framework linking multidimensional trilinear integrability, stationary gravity, and bilinear solution sectors, and clarify why trilinear kernels are both necessary and sufficient for describing soliton dynamics with projective geometry."}

Similar designs are appealing yet largely unexplored in engineered materials due to the complexity of integrating multiple components into a single material platform. Here, we report a dual-latched magneto-elastic shell device capable of selectively activating the latches to regulate snapping pathways and energy output based on specific actuation requirements. Differential deswelling across the thickness acts as the motor to load the elastic energy into the shell, which is then released via the snap-through instability once the loading reaches the critical threshold, constituting an intrinsic mechanical latch. Activation of the external magnetic latch delays snapping onset beyond the threshold of the intrinsic latch, leading to a power-amplified supercritical snap-through instability as well as a bifurcation instability. The combined function of both latches allows for flexible control over energy storage and release. Additionally, this integrated LaMSA system possesses an untethered anchoring mechanism, enabling the device to launch in arbitrary directions from the substrate, driven by the energy released during snapping. We envision that the design principles of dual-latched LaMSA systems will create opportunities for power-dense actuation in engineered materials and robotic devices."}

This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference."}

We attribute this dispersion primarily to (i) the electric-field window probed in TCT measurements, (ii) the choice of mobility model, and (iii) the excitation source (alpha, laser, or electron). Using an aggregated literature dataset, we benchmark the Trofimenkoff and Caughey-Thomas parameterisations together with a new piecewise model for both conduction- and valence-band transport. For electrons, the piecewise model provides the best global description over a broad electric-field range and is shown to arise as the room-temperature limit of a more general superposition framework that explicitly incorporates intervalley repopulation in the conduction band. For holes, the Caughey-Thomas model remains the statistically preferred description, in line with the absence of a strong repopulation effect in the accessible data. Furthermore, we demonstrate a systematic source dependence (alpha versus laser) and quantify its impact on fitted mobility and saturation-velocity values. We provide temperature scalings over narrow intervals around room temperature and recommend parameter sets for implementation in device and detector simulation frameworks. Together, these results reconcile much of the apparent inconsistency in the literature and offer clear guidance for model selection, experimental design, and device-level simulation of charge transport in intrinsic diamond."}

It is necessary to understand how various forms of training set imperfection, such as incompleteness and non-trivial spectroscopic target selection, affect photo-$z$ estimation algorithms, and to identify metrics best-suited to quantify the impact. This work aims to systematically study metrics for diagnosing how various photo-$z$ methods react to certain types of training set incompleteness and non-representativeness. We use methods available through the open-source Python library Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) to systematically test the algorithms CMNN, GPz, FlexZBoost, and PZFlow on mock training data degraded in accordance with several existing spectroscopic sky surveys, as well as under conditions of inverse redshift incompleteness, which approximately mimics observed patterns of incompleteness at high redshift. We employ the algorithm TrainZ as a control. Finally, we quantify photo-$z$ algorithm performance using a variety of statistical metrics implemented externally to RAIL. We determine that the Kullback-Liebler Divergence, Wasserstein Distance, and Probability Integral Transform are particularly informative metrics with which to assess the impact of training set imperfection on algorithmic performance. We also find that inverse redshift incompleteness effects alone lack the complexity to realistically represent anticipated training data."}

Then, we discuss design strategies for an imaging objective to fully exploit the condenser specifications while achieving spatial resolutions comparable to those of X-ray micro-CT instruments. Analytically, we show that for monochromatic beams suitable solutions exist employing arrays of hundreds of identical objectives, realized either as compound refractive lenses (CRLs) or Fresnel zone plates (FZPs). To mitigate the inherent chromatic aberration of these optics, each individual objective could be replaced by an achromatic FZP/CRL combination. Key optical properties of the resulting microscope are estimated. This novel full-field microscopy concept for highly divergent, polychromatic neutron beams has the potential to improve temporal and spatial resolution for large samples and sample environments and to enable the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of projections in neutron tomography."}

Standard NIR flux extraction techniques were developed for space-based observations and assume that source fluxes are constant over an observation. However, ground-based telescopes often see short-timescale atmospheric variations that can dramatically change the number of photons arriving at a pixel. This work presents a new statistical model that shares information between neighboring spectral pixels to characterize time-variable observations and extract unbiased fluxes with optimal uncertainties. We generate realistic synthetic data using a variety of flux and amplitude-of-time-variability conditions to confirm that our model recovers unbiased and optimal estimates of both the true flux and the time-variable signal. We find that the time-variable model should be favored over a constant-flux model when the observed count rates change by more than 3.5%. Ignoring time variability in the data can result in flux-dependent, unknown-sign biases that are as large as ~120% of the flux uncertainty. Using real APOGEE spectra, we find empirical evidence for approximately wavelength-independent, time-dependent variations in count rates with amplitudes much greater than the 3.5% threshold. Our model can robustly measure and remove the time-dependence in real data, improving the quality of data-model comparison. We show several examples where the observed time-dependence quantitatively agrees with independent measurements of observing conditions, such as variable cloud cover and seeing."}

Based on these previous measurements, a dedicated set-up is under completion for performing massive tests to validate and calibrate 32 Silicon Photo-Multipliers (Hamamatsu S13361-3050 series, 64 channels each), composing the (2048 pixels, $12^{\\circ} \\times 6^{\\circ}$ field of view) Focal Surface of the Cherenkov Camera that will fly on the POEMMA-Balloon with Radio mission. The technical details and description of this system and the procedural steps implemented are reported, preliminary measurements on the first Elementary Cell are also shown."}

These bronze artefacts were most likely cast using the lost wax technique: the shapes were moulded with relative ease, and even complex figures could be represented. However, the manufacturing process was not always a single-step solution: in some cases, the parts of the model were moulded separately and then assembled in a second place. The analytical study of these artefacts can help to understand the specific casting methods and to evaluate the techniques implemented by Sardinian craftsmen to produce such complex objects. In recent years, neutron diffraction (ND) and neutron imaging (NI) have proven to be among the most effective methods for non-invasive studies. ND and NI provide complementary quantitative and morphological information that can be the key to understanding the casting processes. In this work, the results of the analysis of a bronze figurine will be reported. The statuette represents a Nuragic warrior and was made available by the Soprintendenza Archeologia Belle Arti e Paesaggio per le province di Sassari e Nuoro (Sassari, Italy)."}

These measurements are usually performed during bright moon periods while the instruments' primary purpose -- gamma-ray observations -- cannot be fulfilled. The Mobile Intensity Interferometer for Stellar Observations was designed as a proof of concept for a purpose-built intensity interferometer. Using acrylic Fresnel lenses 1 m in diameter with 1.2 m focal length, a compact, economical and lightweight design was realised. The detector fixture allows for translation in the z-axis to adjust for measurements at different wavelengths (and therefore focal points) and easy swapping of the detector in its entirety. Both mobility and scalability in quantity of this design allow for specific targeting of projected baselines and orientations based on the target. Particularly for potential binary systems, selective coverage of a target's u-v plane is essential to probing the characteristics accurately. A first campaign demonstrated the capability of these Fresnel lens telescopes by measuring the spatial coherence curve of Arcturus ($α$ Boo). In an observation time of less than 11 h, the angular diameter was measured with milliarcsecond precision, in agreement with the values in the literature."}

Supplemental material included", "summary": "We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.\n  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.\n  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics."}

Wu"], "title": "A Novel, Beam-based Formalism for Active Impedance of Phased Arrays", "comment": "4 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "summary": "The active impedance is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the behavior of large, uniform phased array antennas. However, its conventional calculation via the mutual impedance matrix (or the scattering matrix) offers limited physical intuition and can be computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel derivation of the active impedance directly from the radiated beam pattern of such arrays. This approach maps the scan-angle variation of the active impedance directly to the intrinsic angular variation of the beam, providing a more intuitive physical interpretation. The theoretical derivation is straightforward and rigorous. The validity of the proposed equation is conclusively confirmed through full-wave simulations of a prototype array. This work establishes a new and more intuitive framework for understanding, analyzing and accurately measuring the scan-dependent variations in phased arrays, which is one of the main challenges in modern phased array designs. Consequently, this novel formalism is expected to expedite and simplify the overall design and optimization process for next-generation, large-scale uniform phased arrays."}

Designed to search for Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) above 10$^{21}~$eV and capable of placing a stringent upper limit on their flux at these extreme energies, paving the way to future space-based UHECR observatories, Mini-EUSO has completed more than 150 observation sessions over five years, accumulating approximately 750 hours of data. The mission has produced the first global UV emission maps of Earth and provided valuable insights into lightning phenomena and Transient Luminous Events (TLEs), such as elves, as well as artificial light sources and meteors. Notably, Mini-EUSO has conducted the first systematic space-based meteor survey, detecting over 22,000 meteors and identifying three interstellar candidates. Among the observed TLEs, the most interesting class of phenomena are elves, which appear as expanding ring-shaped structures occurring at $\\sim$90 km altitude. Mini-EUSO has detected elves with varying structures and different numbers of concentric rings, from single-ring up to five rings. Thanks to its imaging capabilities, fast time resolution, and favorable observational geometry, Mini-EUSO is uniquely suited to studying this kind of lightning phenomena, providing unprecedented insight into their dynamics. Additionally, the instrument has demonstrated the capability of a space-based detector to identify short light transients resembling extensive air shower signals while distinguishing them from those produced by UHECRs. This contribution presents a comprehensive summary of the Mini-EUSO mission, its status, and main results."}
