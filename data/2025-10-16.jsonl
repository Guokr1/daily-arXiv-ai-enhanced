To address this question, we adopt a statistical\napproach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all\nknown constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given\nEOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of\nthe sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture\nfor a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.\nHowever, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that\nit is true in general.

We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be\ncustomized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even\ngreater due to its depth.

The method starts with\nderivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the\ninterferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using\nself-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains\n(i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking\ninterferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\\mu$m and\n3.8~$\\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration,\nnear-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based\namplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source\ncalibration star.
