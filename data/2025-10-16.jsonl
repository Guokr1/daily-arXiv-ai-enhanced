To address this question, we adopt a statistical\napproach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all\nknown constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics\n(QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given\nEOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of\nthe sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture\nfor a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking.\nHowever, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that\nit is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the\ncompactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for\nthe maximum compactness and is given by $\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm max} = 1/3$.\nImportantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass\nand a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints."}

We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be\ncustomized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even\ngreater due to its depth. This paper is fully reproducible and produced from\nCommit 4860c70."}

The method starts with\nderivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the\ninterferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using\nself-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains\n(i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking\ninterferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\\mu$m and\n3.8~$\\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration,\nnear-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based\namplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source\ncalibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary\nWolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\\sim 240$ on\nthe target, and $\\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short\nintegration.

Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two\nwavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the\nexpected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star.\nIncluding a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the\nfinal images by about 23\\%."}
