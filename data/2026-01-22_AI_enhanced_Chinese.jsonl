It has long been known that EPR at high magnetic fields offers greater spectral resolution, but limitations in the THz instrumentation have prevented the full realization of these opportunities. Here we describe an EPR spectrometer at the high magnetic field of 14 T using 396 GHz excitation, which adapts techniques from liquid-state NMR to obtain sharp EPR resonances with a width of 210 ppb (full-width half-maximum). We use this to measure resonance positions, and hence g-factors, with a precision that reaches $\\pm$16 ppb. Our use of in-situ liquid-state NMR of our solvent within the same sample improves the accuracy of these measurements: it allows us to reference our EPR measurement back to dilute gas 3He NMR for which quantum calculations are accurate. We measure the g-factor of N@C60 in deuterated toluene as g = 2.002 099 09 (3), where the 3 in brackets means that the uncertainty on the last digit is $\\pm$3.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e8614T\u9ad8\u78c1\u573a\u3001396GHz\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u987a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6db2\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0210ppb\u7684\u7a84\u8c31\u7ebf\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cfg\u56e0\u5b50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u00b116ppb\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6eb6\u5242\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u78c1\u573a\u7535\u5b50\u987a\u78c1\u5171\u632f\uff08EPR\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u4eea\u5668\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u52bf\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u78c1\u573aEPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa14T\u9ad8\u78c1\u573a\u3001396GHz\u6fc0\u53d1\u9891\u7387\u7684EPR\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6db2\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6280\u672f\u83b7\u5f97\u7a84\u8c31\u7ebf\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6837\u54c1\u4e2d\u6eb6\u5242\u7684\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u6807\uff0c\u5c06EPR\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7a00\u91ca\u6c14\u4f533He\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u8fdb\u884c\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86210ppb\uff08\u534a\u9ad8\u5168\u5bbd\uff09\u7684\u7a84EPR\u5171\u632f\u8c31\u7ebf\uff0cg\u56e0\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u00b116ppb\u3002\u6d4b\u5f97N@C60\u5728\u6c18\u4ee3\u7532\u82ef\u4e2d\u7684g\u56e0\u5b50\u4e3ag = 2.002 099 09 (3)\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4f4d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e3a\u00b13\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u78c1\u573aEPR\u8c31\u4eea\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6db2\u4f53\u6838\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684g\u56e0\u5b50\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u3001\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Traditionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used as a flexible machine learning method to mitigate non-Gaussian noise. However, training CNNs requires many data samples, especially when the input data segments are long. Glitches that mimic high-mass black hole signals are empirically known to have a wavelet-like structure. We exploit this property in $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ by using simple neural networks to learn the best family of wavelets to model glitches in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 data. Due to its simplicity, our framework is significantly more sample-efficient than CNNs. As a use case, we build upon the $\\texttt{TIER}$ method and show how $\\texttt{WaveletNet}$ can improve the performance of any search pipeline. We take potential GW candidates from the pipeline, and then downweight the candidates having noisy strain regions in their vicinity. We use our framework in a modular way: we provide an output score which can be added to the pipeline's existing detection statistic score for the candidates. We test our method using candidates from the $\\texttt{IAS-HM}$ search pipeline and show that it improves the search sensitive volume by up to 15% for high-mass, asymmetric binaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "WaveletNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u66f4\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u661f\u641c\u7d22\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u8fbe15%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6bb5\uff1b\u800c\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684glitch\uff08\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcWaveletNet\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f73\u5c0f\u6ce2\u65cf\u6765\u5efa\u6a21LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684glitch\uff1b\u4e0eTIER\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u4fe1\u53f7\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u6743\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "WaveletNet\u76f8\u6bd4CNN\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u4e0eIAS-HM\u641c\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u654f\u611f\u4f53\u79ef\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe15%\u3002", "conclusion": "WaveletNet\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u641c\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available.

While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\u00e9al in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "FRB 2025\u4f1a\u8bae\u901a\u8fc7ECR\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u4f4e\u6ce8\u518c\u8d39\u3001\u6559\u5b66\u65e5\u7b49\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u501f\u9274\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u5c04\u7535\u66b4\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5bf9\u62e5\u6709\u5145\u8db3\u65c5\u884c\u8d44\u91d1\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u6392\u6216\u5730\u7406\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u65e9\u671f\u804c\u4e1a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e86\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u7684\u6210\u957f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f1a\u8bae\u91c7\u7528ECR\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5305\u62ecYouTube\u76f4\u64ad\uff09\u3001\u4f4e\u6ce8\u518c\u8d39\u3001\u4f1a\u8bae\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65e5\u3001\u672c\u5730\u7d20\u98df\u9910\u996e\u3001\u7528\u95ea\u7535\u62a5\u544a\u66ff\u4ee3\u6d77\u62a5\u5c55\u793a\u7b49\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f1a\u540e\u8c03\u67e5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff08\u7ea6\u5360\u603b\u4eba\u6570\u4e00\u534a\uff09\u5bf9\u76f4\u64ad\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u5f55\u5236\u53cd\u9988\u975e\u5e38\u79ef\u6781\uff0c\u6559\u5b66\u65e5\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8d5e\u8d4f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4f4e\u6ce8\u518c\u8d39\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u89c6\u542c\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u8bae\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9002\u5ea6\u9884\u7b97\uff082\u4e07\u52a0\u5143\uff09\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4f1a\u8bae\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u4e3aFRB\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u4f1a\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

By employing a time-domain mode-sum method, we analyze the complex interplay between an incident burst signal and the black hole spacetime. We find that the incident waves can non-resonantly excite a substantial number of high-$l$ modes, with amplitudes for modes as high as l=20 remaining significant compared to the fundamental l=0 mode. We confirm through QNM template fitting that the late-time behaviors of these excited modes are indeed QNMs. After passing through the black hole, we find that the lensed waves form a highly directional and coherent Gaussian beam whose cross-sectional intensity profile is well-described by a Gaussian profile. Unlike spherical waves, this beam's amplitude does not decrease with distance from the black hole but remains nearly constant in the near-field region. Moreover, due to the superposition of numerous QNMs, oscillations largely cancel each other out. The lensed temporal waves do not exhibit typical oscillatory patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4e2d\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5165\u5c04\u6ce2\u80fd\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6fc0\u53d1\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8l\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u900f\u955c\u540e\u5f62\u6210\u5b9a\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\uff0c\u632f\u5e45\u5728\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u4fdd\u6301\u6052\u5b9a\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53e0\u52a0\u4f7f\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u4e2d\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5165\u5c04\u6ce2\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6fc0\u53d1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c42\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5165\u5c04\u8109\u51b2\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6a21\u677f\u62df\u5408\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6fc0\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u5165\u5c04\u6ce2\u80fd\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6fc0\u53d1\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8l\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbel=20\uff09\uff0c\u632f\u5e45\u4e0e\u57fa\u6a21\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u900f\u955c\u540e\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5411\u76f8\u5e72\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\uff0c\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5448\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd1\u573a\u533a\u632f\u5e45\u51e0\u4e4e\u6052\u5b9a\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53e0\u52a0\u4f7f\u632f\u8361\u76f8\u4e92\u62b5\u6d88\uff0c\u900f\u955c\u6ce2\u4e0d\u663e\u793a\u5178\u578b\u632f\u8361\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5f15\u529b\u900f\u955c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6fc0\u53d1\u9ad8\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u51c6\u6b63\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5b9a\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u5149\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u5171\u632f\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5149\u675f\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u9ed1\u6d1e\u4e0e\u6ce2\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

The prompt nature of Cherenkov radiation makes it an ideal candidate for achieving ultimate timing performance in a ToF detector. Using a thin radiator with a high refractive index, such as fused silica, enables the generation of a fast signal from charged particles that exceed the Cherenkov threshold. A crucial requirement for approaching the target time resolution is the optimization of both the radiator material and thickness, as well as the optical coupling to the SiPM arrays. In this work, we present the main factors that affect the time resolution and the expected performance achieved through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the comparison with beam test results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8584\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u8f90\u5c04\u4f53\u8026\u5408\u7845\u5149\u7535\u500d\u589e\u7ba1\u9635\u5217\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7c92\u5b50\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20", "motivation": "\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u6781\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u8f90\u5c04\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u3001\u539a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0eSiPM\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8026\u5408", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8be6\u7ec6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u4e0e\u675f\u6d41\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8584\u8f90\u5c04\u4f53\u6750\u6599\uff08\u5982\u7194\u878d\u77f3\u82f1\uff09\u548c\u539a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSiPM\u9635\u5217\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8584\u5207\u4f26\u79d1\u592b\u8f90\u5c04\u4f53\u4e0eSiPM\u9635\u5217\u7684\u8026\u5408\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7c92\u5b50\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8f90\u5c04\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u548c\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u5149\u5b66\u8026\u5408\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20"}}

HWO will also be able to perform a host of other transformational astrophysics, including cosmology, galaxy evolution, solar system science, and beyond. The development of the telescope and instrument suite is an iterative process. Example observatory architectures, called exploratory analytic cases (EACs) by the HWO Technology Maturation Project Office (TMPO), are modeled end-to-end to explore the engineering and science trade space. Recently, an ultraviolet Integral Field Spectrograph (UV IFS) was added to HWO's instrument suite for the EACs 4 and 5. To explore the science and engineering trade space for this specific instrument, we developed a high-fidelity UV IFS simulation tool, PyISH. The UV IFS simulation tool is designed to be used by scientists to model specific science cases as seen by a UV IFS on HWO, as well as engineers to explore the trade space when developing potential instrument architectures.

Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with R\u00e9nyi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff08EUP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u9ad8\u9636\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\uff08HOEUP\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86MOND\u71b5\u4e0eEUP\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MOND\u71b5\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u7684EUP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u4e49\u71b5\u3001\u622a\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u548cEUP\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u642d\u5efa\u6865\u6881\u3002", "method": "1. \u4eceHOEUP\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u71b5-\u9762\u79ef\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u89c6\u754c\u70ed\u529b\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3001\u71b5\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d8c\u73b0\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u5f17\u91cc\u5fb7\u66fc\u65b9\u7a0b\uff1b3. \u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e7f\u4e49\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff1b4. \u4eceMOND\u71b5\u51fa\u53d1\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684MOND EUP\u3002", "result": "1.

AO systems employing focal-plane wavefront sensors (FP-WFSs) are able to simultaneously correct NCP aberrations and measure science images, but they typically require a second stage of control that adds system cost and complexity. We present control algorithms to augment AO systems with FP-WFSs within their existing control setup. We demonstrate inter-arm NCP aberration transfer can be mitigated through temporal filtering, present frequency- and time-domain validation of controller stability and performance, and discuss the optimality of the chosen controllers. This work will enable the development, testing, and installation of FP-WFS technologies for direct imaging of exoplanets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u96c6\u6210\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u63a7\u5236\u7ea7\u5373\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u975e\u5171\u8def\u50cf\u5dee\u5e76\u83b7\u53d6\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u975e\u5171\u8def\u50cf\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u867d\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6821\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u50cf\u5dee\u5e76\u83b7\u53d6\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7ea7\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u5b66\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u57df\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7f13\u89e3\u81c2\u95f4\u975e\u5171\u8def\u50cf\u5dee\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9891\u57df\u548c\u65f6\u57df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6240\u9009\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5b89\u88c5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u652f\u6301", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u524d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7cfb\u5916\u884c\u661f\u76f4\u63a5\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c"}}

While oxygen is abundant in lunar materials, it is chemically bound within metal oxides whose extractability depends strongly on regolith composition and processing strategy. In this study, we validate and characterize high-fidelity lunar regolith simulants representative of the lunar highlands and south pole using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore structure analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. The simulants exhibit strong mineralogical and compositional fidelity to returned Apollo and Chang'e samples, with ilmenite confirmed as the most readily reducible oxygen-bearing phase. However, despite low ilmenite abundance, bulk highland simulants display favorable reduction behavior arising from distributed Fe-bearing silicate and glassy phases, as well as surface and microstructural properties that influence gas-solid interactions. Adsorption experiments with gases (H2, CH4, and CO2) and water indicate that mineralogical heterogeneity and pore accessibility influence their uptake in simulants. These results indicate that oxygen extraction behavior in realistic lunar regolith is governed by whole-regolith response rather than ilmenite content alone, supporting the option of whole-regolith processing strategies for oxygen production in lunar in situ resource utilization architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6708\u7403\u9ad8\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1\u949b\u94c1\u77ff\u542b\u91cf\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6c27\u63d0\u53d6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6574\u4f53\u6708\u58e4\u54cd\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u949b\u94c1\u77ff\u542b\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c38\u4e45\u6708\u7403\u5b9a\u5c45\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6708\u58e4\u4e2d\u73b0\u573a\u751f\u4ea7\u6c27\u6c14\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u547d\u652f\u6301\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6c27\u5728\u6708\u7403\u6750\u6599\u4e2d\u542b\u91cf\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u91d1\u5c5e\u6c27\u5316\u7269\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6708\u58e4\u6210\u5206\u548c\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u626b\u63cf\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u8272\u6563X\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u8c31\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u884d\u5c04\u3001BET\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u5b54\u9699\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6c22\u6c14\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5347\u6e29\u8fd8\u539f\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6708\u7403\u9ad8\u5730\u548c\u5357\u6781\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6708\u58e4\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u5728\u77ff\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u6210\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0e\u963f\u6ce2\u7f57\u548c\u5ae6\u5a25\u8fd4\u56de\u6837\u54c1\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u949b\u94c1\u77ff\u88ab\u786e\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6700\u6613\u8fd8\u539f\u7684\u542b\u6c27\u76f8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u949b\u94c1\u77ff\u4e30\u5ea6\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u542b\u94c1\u7845\u9178\u76d0\u548c\u73bb\u7483\u76f8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u6c14\u56fa\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8868\u9762\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u6708\u58e4\u4e2d\u7684\u6c27\u63d0\u53d6\u884c\u4e3a\u7531\u6574\u4f53\u6708\u58e4\u54cd\u5e94\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u949b\u94c1\u77ff\u542b\u91cf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u6708\u7403\u539f\u4f4d\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u6708\u58e4\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6c27\u6c14\u751f\u4ea7\u3002"}}

These results highlight the successive roles of LISA and future decihertz missions in establishing a coherent strategy for space-based gravitational-wave astronomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u53cc\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u5728\u5398\u8d6b\u5179\u6ce2\u6bb5\uff08~0.01 Hz\uff09\u7684\u540e\u725b\u987f\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LISA\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\uff0c\u800cDECIGO\u548cBBO\u7b49\u5206\u8d6b\u5179\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u7b2c\u4e09\u8c10\u6ce2\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u9891\u6bb5\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ad9\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5398\u8d6b\u5179\u548c\u5206\u8d6b\u5179\u6ce2\u6bb5\u5bf9\u53cc\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u661f\u7fa4\u6a21\u62df\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u53cc\u767d\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790LISA\u4e0e\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8d6b\u5179\u5929\u6587\u53f0\uff08DECIGO\u3001BBO\uff09\u5bf9\u540e\u725b\u987f\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u7b2c\u4e09\u8c10\u6ce2\u7684\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "LISA\u53ea\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u56db\u6781\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\uff08\u9664\u6781\u5c11\u6570\u90bb\u8fd1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5916\uff09\uff1b\u800cDECIGO\u548cBBO\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ea610%\u7684~5 mHz\u4ee5\u4e0a\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u8c10\u6ce2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "LISA\u548c\u672a\u6765\u5206\u8d6b\u5179\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff0cLISA\u8d1f\u8d23\u56db\u6781\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u8d6b\u5179\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u5219\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u9ad8\u9636\u8c10\u6ce2\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u534f\u53d8\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u725b\u987f\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u5207\u8c03\u5236\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u805a\u7126\u3002", "motivation": "\u6f84\u6e05\u725b\u987f\u76f4\u89c9\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u805a\u7126\u548c\u574d\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u548c\u514b\u5c14\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u843d\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u6c47\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u53d81+3\u63cf\u8ff0\uff08\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u526a\u5207\u548cRaychaudhuri\u6f14\u5316\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u514b\u5c14\u65f6\u7a7a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u6bd4\u53f2\u74e6\u897f\u65f6\u7a7a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u6216\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5f84\u5411\u4e0b\u843d\uff1b\u9ed1\u6d1e\u65cb\u8f6c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6539\u53d8\u65e0\u65cb\u4e0b\u843d\u6d41\u7684\u526a\u5207\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u81a8\u80c0\u5e45\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u526a\u5207\u8c03\u5236\u63a7\u5236\u7740\u6574\u4f53\u805a\u7126\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u5207\u8c03\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u51cf\u5f31\u5f15\u529b\u574d\u7f29\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u4e0b\u843d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f15\u529b\u805a\u7126\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

By extending the traditional Walker-Penrose method, which is limited by its reliance on specific symmetric structures and Killing tensors, we overcome these limitations by constructing an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerical framework that combines the photon orbit equation with the polarization parallel transport equation. This allows for the self-consistent evolution of photon trajectories and polarization states in any spacetime backgrounds without relying on specific symmetries. Using this framework, we analyze the effects of black hole spin and charge on the polarization characteristics of radiation from both prograde and retrograde accretion disks.

Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f62\u53d8\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u8fd1\u7c7b\u65f6\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u53d7\u9650\u4e09\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u6f6e\u6c50\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\u7ecf\u5386\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5f31\u6df7\u6c8c\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5760\u5165\u9ed1\u6d1e\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u9003\u9038\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u65e0\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f62\u53d8\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u52a8\u673a\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u79cd\u5929\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5438\u79ef\u76d8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u65cb\u8fdb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u53d7\u9650\u4e09\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u6027\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f62\u53d8\u65cb\u8f6c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7c7b\u65f6\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u534a\u89e3\u6790\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8f68\u9053\u8f6c\u53d8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6f6e\u6c50\u632f\u5e45\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u6f6e\u6c50\u573a\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u675f\u7f1a\u8f68\u9053\u7ecf\u5386\u56db\u4e2a\u6f14\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5404\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u6f6e\u6c50\u632f\u5e45\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5730\u9762\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u9891\u6bb5\u5185\uff0c\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u7269\u8d28\u6d41\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u8017\u5c3d\uff0c\u800cLISA\u548c(B-)DECIGO\u53ef\u63a2\u6d4b\u66f4\u65e9\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u6f6e\u6c50\u6270\u52a8\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u632f\u8361\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f6e\u6c50\u5f62\u53d8\u5bf9\u9ed1\u6d1e\u5468\u56f4\u8f68\u9053\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u76f8\u4f4d\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5438\u79ef\u9ed1\u6d1eX\u5c04\u7ebf\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u632f\u8361\u63d0\u4f9b\u5171\u632f\u6fc0\u53d1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\\ln \u03c6$, $V = V_0 \u03c6^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\u03c6$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B > -1$.
